This exposes small retail investors to big potential losses.” The number of deaths through July 2020 is 8% to 12% higher than it would have been if the coronavirus pandemic had never happened.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-stock-market-metric-has-correctly-predicted-presidential-election-results-since-1984-11598986959?mod=home-page",
    "text": "The 2020 election race between incumbent President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden is a coin toss,  LPL financial chief market strategist Ryan Detrick says. Indeed, a number of polls and betting odds indicate that a once-yawning lead enjoyed by Biden is starting to wane. Real Clear Politics shows that the Democratic nominee is leading Trump by 6.2 percentage points, based on an average of national polls, and his advantage in so-called battleground states, stands at a relatively razor-thin margin of 2.7 percentage points, according to a separate RCP poll average. But Detrick says that a simple equity-market chart has been the best predictor of U.S. presidential elections since 1984, proving 100% accurate—and is 87% accurate since 1928. The LPL analyst says that a chart of the S&P 500’s performance in the three-month period ahead of Election Day, which is Nov. 3 this year, has proven accurate over the past nearly four decades. Detrick writes that a positive return over that three-month period “may signal an increased likelihood that the incumbent party may win, while stock market losses during the same period have tended to predict an opposition party win.” To be sure, the strategist acknowledges that the market isn’t the economy and that millions of people are out of work due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, but notes that a look at what stocks may say about the outcome of election may be one thing for investor to consider as they prepare for an uncertain stretch of trade ahead of that key vote. “The unique circumstances around this year’s pandemic seem to add plausibility that this could be the first time in almost 100 years that this signal may be wrong—especially if the stock market and economy continue to recover between now and Election Day,” he wrote. All that said, Detrick said that Trump is still contending with an even bigger factor that could stymie his re-election chances beyond the stock-market gains: a recession. “History has shown that when a recession has occurred during the two years before the election, the incumbent president has tended to lose,” the analysts wrote. “ In fact, the economy incredibly has predicted the winner of every presidential election going back to President Calvin Coolidge,” he added. That statistic also offers its own inherent caveat since the recession that ensued in this pandemic is a global one and occurred a stunning and historic rate. But the president’s handling of the current pandemic and the ensuing public-health crisis may be the one thing that voters weigh against or in favor of Trump. MarketWatch columnist Mark Hulbert, in an article on Tuesday pointing out the fallibility of trying to spot correlations between stock performance and election outcomes, says that investors should “be on your guard…for those using the stock market to predict who will win the White House in November.” Notably, he says that the historical data can be contorted to say a number of things but also that the range period, including a three-month stretch before the election, is arbitrary and should raise a caution for observers. A big NIO bear is a little less bearish. And his upgrade is enough to get NIO shares moving again on Tuesday. Mark DeCambre is MarketWatch's markets editor. He is based in New York.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/pence-told-to-be-on-standby-for-trumps-2019-hospital-visit-new-book-says-trump-denies-having-mini-strokes-2020-09-01?mod=home-page",
    "text": "WASHINGTON — A new book is reviving questions about President Donald Trump’s unscheduled visit to Walter Reed military hospital last fall with the revelation that “word went out” for Vice President Mike Pence to stand by to temporarily assume presidential powers if Trump had to receive anesthesia for a medical procedure. The White House has said the president’s November 2019 visit, which raised questions at the time about Trump’s health, was part of his routine annual physical, and said the president wanted to get a head start on what typically is an hours-long, head-to-toe exam because he’d be busy this year with campaigning. A president’s routine medical checkup typically is announced ahead of time. The White House provided no other details at the time. Trump’s White House doctor said in a statement Tuesday the president “remains healthy” and “fit to execute the duties of the Presidency.” Pence’s office declined comment. Trump visited Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, about a month before the Democratic-controlled House impeached him over his conduct toward Ukraine. “In reporting for this book, I learned that in the hours leading up to Trump’s trip to the hospital, word went out in the West Wing for the vice president to be on standby to take over the powers of the presidency temporarily if Trump had to undergo a procedure that would have required him to be anesthetized,” Michael Schmidt writes in “Donald Trump v. the United States: Inside the Struggle To Stop A President.” “Pence never assumed the powers of the presidency, and the reason for Trump’s trip to the doctor remains a mystery,” Schmidt says in the book. Schmidt is a New York Times and Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter. Trump responded Tuesday on Twitter to Schmidt’s reporting and other speculation about his health, and later had his White House doctor attest to his health. “It never ends! Now they are trying to say that your favorite President, me, went to Walter Reed Medical Center, having suffered a series of mini-strokes. Never happened to THIS candidate - FAKE NEWS,” Trump tweeted. Dr. Sean Conley, Trump’s White House doctor, followed up Tuesday with a statement in which he said Trump has not experienced or been evaluated for a stroke, a mini-stroke or any acute cardiovascular emergency. “The president remains healthy and I have no concerns about his ability to maintain the rigorous schedule ahead of him,” said Conley, who flew with Trump to Wisconsin on Tuesday. “As stated in my last report, I expect him to remain fit to execute the duties of the presidency.” In June, Conley released a statement saying Trump had completed the physical in April. Along with releasing some findings about the president’s health, Conley said there were “no findings of significance or changes” and said Trump “remains healthy.” The number of deaths through July 2020 is 8% to 12% higher than it would have been if the coronavirus pandemic had never happened.

    "title": "CDC issues nationwide eviction ban through the end of the year in an effort to control coronavirus",
    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/cdc-issues-nationwide-eviction-ban-through-the-end-of-the-year-in-an-effort-to-control-coronavirus-2020-09-01?mod=home-page",
    "text": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is using its authority to implement a temporary eviction moratorium through the end of the year, the Trump administration said Tuesday evening. The moratorium builds on a previous executive order from President Trump that directed the Department of Health and Human Services and the CDC to determine whether halting evictions was necessary to contain the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19. “President Trump is committed to helping hard-working Americans stay in their homes and combatting the spread of the coronavirus,” White House deputy press secretary Brian Morgenstern said during a press briefing Tuesday. The moratorium will apply to any state where there is not already a more protective ban in effect. Multiple states still have eviction moratoriums in place, including California. Earlier Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told a U.S. House of Representatives panel that the moratorium would cover around 40 million renters. Renters will be eligible for the moratorium’s protection if they received an economic impact payment, or stimulus check, as provided for by the CARES Act. Therefore, single renters must earn no more than $99,000 a year, while couples filing jointly can earn up to $198,000 annually. In order to be covered by the CDC moratorium, renters must fill out a form, which senior Trump administration officials said would be available on the Federal Register and the CDC’s website. Renters must indicate that they cannot afford to pay their rent in full and that they would become homeless or move into congregate housing. Renters also must be able to prove that they made an effort to receive government assistance and that they could not afford rent. Renters are then asked to provide the signed declaration to their landlord. Landlords will still be permitted to evict tenants in certain cases, such as instance where the tenant has destroyed property or poses a threat to the healthy or safety of neighbors. “In the context of a pandemic, eviction moratoria — like quarantine, isolation, and social distancing — can be an effective public health measure utilized to prevent the spread of communicable disease,” the CDC said in an unpublished agency order on the Federal Register regarding its choice to implement the nationwide ban . The moratorium does not absolve renters of paying the rent, however. That money is still due to landlords, and senior administration officials said that renters should still attempt to make partial payments when they cannot afford to pay in full. Housing advocates said the move was “long overdue,” but called for more help to be provided to renters facing financial difficulties amid historically high levels of unemployment caused by the pandemic. “As we have said for five months, the very least the federal government ought to do is assure each of us that we won’t lose our homes in the middle of a global pandemic: the administration’s action would do so and will provide relief from the growing threat of eviction for millions of anxious families,” said Diane Yentel, president and CEO of the National Low Income Housing Coalition. “But while an eviction moratorium is an essential step, it is a half-measure that extends a financial cliff for renters to fall off of when the moratorium expires and back rent is owed,” Yentel added, while calling on Congress to pass another COVID-19 relief bill with at least $100 billion in emergency rental assistance. Previously, some lawmakers and activists called for a cancellation of rent during the pandemic. Trump administration officials during Tuesday’s briefing said that renters and landlords would have access to emergency funds already in place, including billions of dollars in grants from the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the $142 billion coronavirus relief fund from the Treasury Department. Administration officials could not clarify, however, whether the CDC moratorium would prevent eviction filings from occurring. Housing and legal advocates have raised concerns that landlords filed evictions against many people nationwide who should have been protected by the CARES Act moratorium. An executive order by President Donald Trump called for distributing an additional $300 in weekly unemployment benefits from a $44 billion fund set aside for disaster relief.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/zooms-big-earnings-report-sends-stock-toward-a-100-billion-plus-valuation-2020-09-01?mod=home-page",
    "text": "Zoom Video Communications Inc. topped a $100-billion market cap for the first time Tuesday, as continuing success amid the COVID-19 pandemic sent shares more than 40% higher in a single session. Analysts had high praise for the latest numbers, with JPMorgan’s Sterling Auty cheering the “truly impressive and in some ways unprecedented quarter” and FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi discussing Zoom’s “truly explosive growth.” Seyrafi called Zoom “the pre-eminent financial beneficiary of the COVID-19 crisis” and said he saw room for upside to fiscal third-quarter and full-year estimates. “For example, the company is guiding for revenue growth of ~3% quarter-over-quarter in the current FQ3 quarter, but we estimate that the average number of customers with more than 10 employees will grow by 18% Q/Q,” he wrote. “If we assume that revenue from customers with 10 or fewer employees grows by 5% Q/Q and if we model that the number of customers with more than 10 employees grows by 2% Q/Q, then in order to fit guidance, average revenue per user for customers with more than 10 employees will need to fall by 13% Q/Q.” That decline seems unlikely in his view, considering that Zoom’s average revenue per user for this base of customers hasn’t typically declined in the fiscal third quarter, in Seyrafi’s view. “Therefore, if prior ARPU trends persist, then there may be 15% of revenue upside relative to our model, which uses company guidance,” he concluded. Seyrafi has an outperform rating on the stock and he boosted his price target to $525 from $250. The July numbers left Bank of America’s Nikolay Beliov feeling upbeat about the long-term potential for Zoom’s business, even after the pandemic subsides. “The results confirm our view that Zoom is both a ‘vaccine’ and ‘vitamin’...as COVID-19 has permanently shifted the world to a hybrid-work environment and clearly elevated the awareness of cloud communications and videoconferencing,” he wrote. “This gives us confidence that these results are not just a pull forward of business, but are durable and sustainable trends.” Beliov has a buy rating on the stock and raised his price objective to $475 from $260. Needham’s Richard Valera argued that the company has an opportunity to double its revenue once again over the next three to four years. “While Zoom’s massive user growth has skewed its base toward the higher churn <10 user cohort, which will drive higher than historical churn, we see this as more than offset by the increased opportunity from both an enduring secular shift toward remote work, and a larger installed base to cross-sell Phone, Rooms and future products into,” he wrote, while reiterating a buy rating and upping his price target to $440 from $230. JPMorgan’s Auty said that other metrics beyond Zoom’s 355% revenue growth were notable as well. “It is the 41.7% operating margins and $373.4 million in quarterly free cash flow that stand out to us, especially when we consider the magnitude of the customers that are paying monthly and not annual in advance like some software companies rely on.” He maintained an overweight rating and boosted his price target to $425 from $220. At least 13 analysts hiked their targets after the report, according to FactSet. Of the 32 analysts tracked by the service who cover Zoom, 15 have buy ratings, 14 have hold ratings, and three have sell ratings. The average target now stands at $379.78. Apple Inc.’s stock price will appear quite a bit lower Monday morning, but investors shouldn’t fret. Emily Bary is a MarketWatch reporter based in New York. Copyright © 2020 MarketWatch, Inc.

    "text": "So much for playing videogames to escape reality — the 2020 U.S. presidential election has now even infiltrated “Animal Crossing.” Yes, the millions of people playing “Animal Crossing: New Horizons” since it was released for the Nintendo Switch in March, in which players build their own virtual islands populated by cute critters, can now add Joe Biden campaign signs to their digital front yards. Biden’s presidential campaign revealed its “Animal Crossing” partnership on Tuesday. “Show your Biden/Harris pride virtually!” it declared on its official campaign store, along with QR codes for players to scan and add the free political insignia all over their islands. The designs include the official Biden-Harris logo, a Team Joe logo, a “Joe” Pride logo, as well as a print of three aviator sunglasses in red, white and blue. “’Animal Crossing’ is a dynamic, diverse, and powerful platform that brings communities together from across the world,” Christian Tom, director of digital partnerships for the Biden campaign, said in a statement. “It is an exciting new opportunity for our campaign to engage and connect Biden-Harris supporters as they build and decorate their islands.” And the virtual campaign signs fit into the Biden camp’s pandemic playbook of hosting more online events, live-streamed fundraisers and speeches, while Trump has continued to campaign in person. Reps from Nintendo did not immediately respond to a MarketWatch query about whether the Biden campaign had to pay for those virtual signs to be available in the “Animal Crossing” game. Trump’s reelection campaign has not officially created campaign signs or T-shirts for “Animal Crossing,” although players can make their own — and in fact, have already done so. There are Trump and MAGA insignia on many individuals’ islands. CNN noted that, so far, there actually appear to be a few dozen more “MAGA” and “Trump” designs created by “Animal Crossing” gamers than Biden designs. Trump campaign deputy national press secretary Samantha Zager mocked Biden’s videogame gambit on Tuesday. “This explains everything: Joe Biden thinks he’s campaigning for president of ‘Animal Crossing’ from his basement,” she told CNN. “The Trump campaign will continue to spend its resources campaigning in the real world with real Americans.” Many people on social media also groaned at the Biden campaign’s “Animal Crossing” signs, as well, recalling Hillary Clinton calling on voters to “Pokemon Go to the polls” while she was running against Trump in 2016, citing another Nintendo gaming title. This isn’t the first time that political movements have made a mark in “Animal Crossing,” however. Players have also added Black Lives Matter flags and T-shirts to the game. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the federal government’s top infectious disease expert, says Labor Day weekend will be key in determining whether the U.S. gets a “running start” at containing the coronavirus this fall.

    "title": "Only 19% of Tesla analysts say buy the stock while investors remain ‘insatiable’",
    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/only-19-of-tesla-analysts-say-buy-the-stock-while-investors-remain-insatiable-2020-09-01?mod=home-page",
    "text": "There is an old Wall Street saying that investing isn’t about being right or wrong, it’s about making money. No one understands that better than an investor in Tesla Inc.’s stock. The financial fundamentals and the historical valuations of earnings suggest the market is wrong about the electric vehicle (EV) maker’s stock price, according to the overwhelming majority of Tesla analysts. But the stock keeps rising and Tesla investors keep making money. No one is making more money than Elon Musk, Tesla’s chief executive officer, largest shareholder and arguably its most important cheerleader, who just became the third-richest person in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak, who has been bearish on Tesla since Jan. 23 2019, when the stock closed at $57.52, put it this way in a note to clients: Spak raised his price target to $290 from $170, but his target was still 42% below Monday’s closing price. See related: His short position just got ‘obliterated,’ but this Tesla bear isn’t giving up. Also read: Tesla takes advantage of stock’s best month in 7 years with $5 billion offering. There are some fundamental reasons for investors being right to buy, as Tesla has been profitable for four straight quarters, while Wall Street was wrong to expect losses in three of the past four quarters. And despite concerns about the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, Tesla delivered way more EVs than expected during the second quarter. While the 5-for-1 stock split Tesla announced on Aug. 11 didn’t improve the company’s fundamentals in any way, investors were right to buy or hold on to their shares, for now, as the price has charged up more than 80% since the announcement through Monday. Read more: Tesla stock rally accelerates further into record territory after split takes effect. Despite such strong investor conviction, 81% of analysts don’t recommend buying. Of the 36 analysts surveyed by FactSet, only seven, or 19%, have the equivalent of buy ratings on Tesla’s stock. And only one of those analysts, Jefferies’s Philippe Houchois, had a price target — $500 — that was above Monday’s closing price. Meanwhile, half the analysts had the equivalent of hold ratings and 11 analysts, or 31%, had the equivalent of sell ratings. The average price target of all the analysts was $261.85, according to FactSet, which implied a 47% drop from Monday’s closing price. Most of what analysts have been wrong about Tesla has taken place over roughly the past five months. At the end of March, when the COVID-19 crisis was full blown, there were the same number of bearish analysts as there are now and the average stock price target was $101.86, just 2.8% below the March 31 closing price of $104.80. With the stock’s gain since then, Tesla’s market capitalization increased to $464.3 billion as of Monday’s close, which was the seventh highest among U.S. companies. RBC’s Spak suggested that what may also keep supporting the stock is that given the sheer market valuation of Tesla, many portfolio managers have to add to positions “just to keep pace.” He also believes investors have been willing to show more patience and look further into the future to value the stock. “We still view Tesla as fundamentally overvalued and having to grow into its valuation,” Spak wrote. Spak recognizes that Tesla is clearly ahead of its competition, has relatively inexpensive access to capital, the ability to attract talent, an “incredible” brand, and understands that “narrative, momentum and other factors” can impact the stock price. But he still believes that ultimately, a company’s value is related to fundamental factors. Basically, he’s suggesting that one of the biggest risk factors to Tesla’s stock isn’t good or bad fundamental news, but how investors value that news. The next major potential news catalyst is Tesla’s “battery day” scheduled for Sept. 22, of which Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said recently he’s expecting a number of potential “game changing” developments. One of those developments is the “million mile” battery, which in theory will support an EV for 1 million miles, which could put Tesla miles ahead of its traditional gasoline-powered automotive competitors. That said, Ives is one of the analysts that doesn’t recommend buying — he’s at hold — while his price target of $380 suggests the stock could fall 24%. For those looking for actual fundamental risks, the following are just some of those included in the more than 20 pages of “risk factors” Tesla lists in its latest quarterly report filed on July 28. So far, those risks haven't mattered to Tesla investors. • “We are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer.” • “We have been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by the global COVID-19 pandemic, the duration and economic, governmental and social impact of which is difficult to predict, which may significantly harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.” • “We have experienced in the past, and may experience in the future, delays or other complications in the design, manufacture, launch, and production ramp of our vehicles, energy products, and product features, or may not realize our manufacturing cost targets, which could harm our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.” • “Our future growth and success is dependent upon consumers’ willingness to adopt electric vehicles and specifically our vehicles. We operate in the automotive industry, which is generally susceptible to cyclicality and volatility.” • “Any issues or delays in meeting our projected timelines, costs and production at or funding the ramp of Gigafactory Shanghai, or any difficulties in generating and maintaining local demand for vehicles manufactured there, could adversely impact our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition.” • “If our vehicles or other products that we sell or install fail to perform as expected, our ability to develop, market and sell our products and services could be harmed.” • “The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and we may not be successful in competing in these industries. We currently face competition from new and established domestic and international competitors and expect to face competition from others in the future, including competition from companies with new technology.” Zoom Video Communications Inc. made as much money in May, June and July as it did in all of 2019, beating even the outsize expectations of Wall Street and sending its stock — already trading at record highs — more than 20% higher in after-hours trading.

    "title": "Airlines are getting rid of flight change fees — but don’t expect air travel to get any cheaper",
    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/airlines-are-getting-rid-of-flight-change-fees-but-dont-expect-air-travel-to-get-any-cheaper-11598986778?mod=home-page",
    "text": "While multiple airlines have bid adieu to flight change fees permanently, travelers shouldn’t get their hopes up for fee-free flying in the near future. Almost all airlines have waived flight-change fees in some regard since the coronavirus pandemic became a major concern beginning in March. However, airlines have chosen to make the change permanent as the industry continues to struggle amid the pandemic. While the number of people traveling by air has increased substantially from the COVID-19-fueled lows in April and May, it still remains well below the norm. On Monday, over 711,000 passengers went through Transportation Security Administration checkpoints, the agency reported, which was two-thirds less than the 2.2 million people who went through U.S. airports a year ago. And with the peak summer travel season coming to an end, airlines are scrambling. “They’re seeing the writing on the wall and saying, ‘We could be facing some really empty flights this fall and winter,’” said Scott Keyes, founder and chief flight expert at travel website Scott’s Cheap Flights. By permanently doing away with the change fees, airlines are attempting to give travelers some peace of mind as they consider whether to make flight reservations during this still-uncertain time. If it’s still not advisable to travel come Thanksgiving or Christmas, travelers could simply switch to flights in 2021 without paying much more. “It takes away so much of the stress of booking a trip you know might not happen,” said Sara Rathner, credit cards and travel expert at personal-finance website NerdWallet. “Now, you can book a flight if you need to without feeling like you’ll be punished if you have to reschedule.” But consumers still need to read the fine print, even as airlines eliminate these fees. For starters, although consumers will no longer need to pay a fee if they change their flight reservation in some capacity with the airlines that have ushered in the new policy, they are still on the hook for any difference in fares. So if the new tickets cost more, you will be paying more. And if the new tickets cost less or you decide not to travel after all, you likely won’t be getting any sort of refund. “Free changes are not the same as free cancellations,” Keyes said. Many airlines have relaxed their rules regarding cancellations, allowing consumers to cancel their flights proactively. But passengers who do this in the vast majority of cases are being given vouchers for future travel rather than cash refunds. And those vouchers tend to come with expiration dates, meaning travelers must book new flights within a specified period of time or else they lose the money. While flight change fees weren’t necessarily the biggest driver of revenue for airlines, fees are still integral to their bottom lines. “Airlines have built their entire business model on fees,” said Christopher Elliott, chief advocacy officer at Elliot Advocacy, a nonprofit organization that supports consumers. “These are desperate airlines resorting to desperate measures.” Major airlines have copied this model, not only by offering “basic economy” tickets that replicate the budget-airline price point, but also by charging fees for extras like checked bags across the board. “People say they hate the fees,” Keyes said. “But what they really love more than low fees is low fares.” Given how critical fees are to airlines’ business model today, travel experts say that the unfortunate reality for travelers is that the future likely holds more fees and not fewer. “Just because airlines have eliminated change fees doesn’t mean we’re about to enter a new golden age of travel,” Rathner said. “Airlines will find a way to make up revenue because they need to stay in business,” she added. “We’ve already seen them lay off employees and cut routes. We may also see increased fares, or new fees get tacked on or rolled into the base fare.” In particular, airlines could use the past as inspiration: After the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11,  2001, some carriers began charging an additional security fee, Rathner said. “We might see fees that help cover the cost of enhanced cleaning procedure,” she said. And once the pandemic is over, experts said that airlines could very well reintroduce flight-change fees as people begin to travel more.

    "text": "At the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, close to eight of 10 MBA students say they are not excited about the coming fall semester because the coronavirus pandemic has forced classes online. At UCLA’s Anderson School of Management, newly admitted international students are outraged that they cannot defer their admission to the school’s MBA program even if they cannot get a student visa to come to the U.S. At New York University’s Stern School of Business, students are demanding the reversal of a 3.5% increase in MBA tuition during COVID-19 and asking for a 5% to 10% discount on the price of their degrees because of the shift to virtual classes. Add to all of the anxiety and frustration the fact that some graduates from the most prestigious business schools, including Harvard and Stanford universities, saw their summer internships and full-time job offers clawed back by companies due to the COVID recession. Many more are deeply worried about their prospects for landing a job over the next year as still more companies freeze budgets and hiring plans. So is this a time to apply to an MBA program and go even further into debt? You better believe it is, and here’s why. A recession and a health crisis, no matter how severe, will not last forever. But while it lasts, many will find their opportunities to advance at work diminished or completely curtailed. Many more have already found themselves on unemployment. By the time this year’s incoming MBA students graduate in 2023, it is almost a certainty that both COVID-19 and the economic downturn will be in the rearview mirror. The Class of 2023 will inevitably graduate into a fully recovered economy, better prepared to take full advantage of the upturn. No less crucial, they will have been the beneficiaries of not merely the business basics or of the leadership development a strong MBA program provides; they will be steeped in both data analytics, specifically how to smartly harness massive datasets for decision making, and how to leverage new technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, to gain important efficiencies in a business moving forward. Of all the graduate degrees you could earn, an MBA from a highly selective business school is pretty much a no-brainer investment. The top five schools for average starting pay last year — base salary plus signing bonus — are all big names, led by the Wharton School at $172,016, NYU Stern ($168,291), Stanford ($168,226), Dartmouth College’s Tuck School of Business ($166,251), and the University of Virginia’s Darden School of Business ($165,292). In all, 12 schools in the top 25 of U.S. News’s MBA ranking report starting salaries above $160,000, and 17 above $150,000. “If you stayed at work in 2021, your career options and earning potential in 2023 would be more limited if you had gone to business school,” noted Soojin Kwon, managing director of full-time MBA admissions and program at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business. Why? Kwon notes that students will gain three advantages by going back to school that they won’t get by staying in a job during the pandemic. “One, you’ll meet with and learn from hundreds of smart, ambitious and interesting people you wouldn’t have met if you didn’t go to business school,” Kwon said at a recent panel discussion for Poets & Quants.  “Two, you’re going to learn how to network and interview for jobs in an industry or function that you’re interested in going into, and most, if not all MBA recruiters this year are planning to do virtual recruiting. So you’re going to learn how to interview in the format in which recruiters are going to be recruiting. In addition, she said, “You’re going to gain access to a network of tens of thousands of business school alumni and hundreds of thousands of alumni in the broader university community. You could absolutely find another job through LinkedIn, but it’s no secret that you’re more likely to get a response if you have some kind of connection, and an MBA from a top school with the support of alumni provides that invaluable connection for life.” During the Great Recession of 2008-2009, the job situation was just as miserable and prospects for many MBAs appeared so dim that some openly questioned their decision to borrow money to get the degree. Robert Bruner, then dean of the University of Virginia’s Darden School of Business, found himself having to defend the value of the MBA. He rose to the challenge, and his points then made much sense now. Education adds significant value to human potential. “Generally, research finds real rates of return on investment upwards of 10% and as high as 50%. And there is a correlation between years in school and earning power but that’s only the quantitative part. Every year, students graduate who are more self-confident, better communicators, and more promising leaders than when they enrolled. And they have joined an alumni network that has helped in good times and bad.” Indeed, long-term thinking beats short-term thinking all the time. Young professionals have a long career ahead of them. “With the benefits of modern medicine, you can probably look forward to a career of 50 years,” Bruner wrote. “Are you judging the worth of an MBA by only the first job you get out of B-school? Take the long view. If you could discount the marginal benefits of an MBA from a competitive school over the next 50 years, I’d guess that they well exceed the costs. Don’t discount the future too steeply.” Truth is, you can bet with certainty that tough times will again appear once this pandemic is under control and the economy recovers. The ability to assess and bear sensible risks is the core of business and entrepreneurship. Pursuing a graduate degree in business to learn valuable skills, cultivate one’s leadership potential, and acquire a supportive network of connected professionals is a risk worth taking. John A.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-what-to-know-about-abbotts-15-minute-covid-19-test-11598982464?mod=home-page",
    "text": "On Aug. 26, the Food and Drug Administration granted an Emergency Use Authorization to a new rapid antigen test for COVID-19 called the BinaxNOW test. I study public health policy to combat infectious disease epidemics. Testing is one of the most powerful tools available to fight the spread of COVID-19. The new test is inexpensive, rapid and easy to use. It will massively scale up access to testing, but hurdles remain in achieving widespread, frequent COVID-19 testing. The credit-card-sized test is an antigen test that detects a specific viral protein from SARS-CoV-2. It costs $5 and doesn’t require a lab or a machine for processing. Performing the test is simple. A health-care worker or technician would use a swab to collect a sample from less than 1 inch inside the nostril. They would then combine the sample with a few drops of chemicals inside the test card. Within 15 minutes, the test strip would show a positive or negative result. The test is also paired with an app that produces a digital code that can be scanned to show proof of a recent negative COVID-19 test. The BinaxNOW test is currently only authorized for patients who have had COVID-19 symptoms for seven days or less, which is when virus levels in the body are likely to be high. It must be prescribed by a physician and performed by a trained technicianor other health-care worker. The PCR test for COVID-19 is currently widely used and considered the gold standard, but requires patient samples to be sent to a lab and can take days to provide results. The new antigen test is designed to be a cheap and quick alternative to PCR testing for diagnostic purposes in a medical setting. It would add critical capacity to an overstretched testing system. The emergency use authorization provides preliminary authorization for doctors to prescribe the antigen test while the full FDA approval process is ongoing. The authorization could be revoked if the test is not as accurate or reliable as expected. However, the true accuracy could be lower because the performance testing group was only 102 people and the accuracy hasn’t been validated by the FDA as part of the full approval process. There will inevitably be some false negatives and false positives with the BinaxNOW test since accuracy isn’t 100%, but the FDA will monitor the data to make sure the test meets the reported accuracy. The BinaxNOW test is cheap, rapid, able to be mass-produced and easy to use outside a lab. This makes it a promising candidate for widespread screening. However, the test is currently only authorized for people with COVID-19 symptoms. This is an obstacle because an estimated 40% of all COVID-19 cases are asymptomatic and these people likely don’t know that they’re contagious. To maximize the effectiveness of any COVID-19 screening program, it is important to test people whether they have symptoms or not. Health-care providers are able to prescribe the BinaxNOW test for asymptomatic patients for off-label use, but health officials don’t yet know how accurate the test is when performed on asymptomatic people. The massive expansion of testing access made possible by the BinaxNOW test will almost surely outweigh the downsides of a small number of inaccurate results. Abbott plans to manufacture 50 million tests per month starting in October. This will quickly exceed the 76 million COVID-19 tests the U.S. has performed over the last six months. Widespread, frequent testing is effective at slowing the spread of the coronavirus. The new testing capacity made possible by the authorization of this rapid antigen test represents a major advance in bringing the pandemic under control.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/trumps-payroll-tax-order-will-mean-bigger-paychecks-this-year-but-2021-is-a-different-story-2020-09-01?mod=home-page",
    "text": "Weeks after President Donald Trump authorized a payroll-tax deferral to try to free up cash for Americans dealing with the coronavirus pandemic, the Internal Revenue Service now has specifics about what the order means for companies cutting paychecks and the workers receiving those checks. For a worker whose employer chooses to defer the tax obligation, the upshot is simple: slightly bigger paychecks now and slightly smaller paychecks next year, according to payroll-processing experts who have analyzed the IRS guidance. “Their only obligation is to sort of understand that, starting in January, their net pay is going to be a little bit less. So don’t be surprised when that happens.” Starting next year, “your check very well will go down, if the tax isn’t forgiven, which is a giant unknown,” said Laura Melville, who heads Wiss & Co.’s outsourced payroll services. Trump’s order instructs Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s staff to consider crafting a bill that would forgive the payroll taxes deferred from September through December, with Trump up for re-election on Nov. 3 and trailing in national and battleground polls. In normal times — when the economy isn’t staggering under a public health crisis — federal payroll taxes take a bit off the top of every paycheck. Specifically, 6.2% of an employee’s gross earnings go toward Social Security, and 1.45% goes to Medicare taxes. The employer pays the same rate, and that combines for a 12.4% Social Security tax and a 2.9% Medicare tax. (Under the CARES Act, employers don’t have to pay their side of the Social Security tax through the end of the year. They can repay half by next year and the other half by 2022.) With federal lawmakers at loggerheads over another stimulus bill, Trump signed the executive order deferring the employee’s 6.2% tax obligation for pay between Sept. 1 and the end of the year. He also signed memos that, among other things, greenlighted $300 in supplemental unemployment benefits. When it came to payroll taxes, Trump’s order said, “This modest, targeted action will put money directly in the pockets of American workers.” The tax deferral doesn’t do anything for millions of unemployed who aren’t on payrolls to begin with, according to critics. Others questioned how to put the order into effect. In addition, the negative short- and long-term impacts on the Social Security system of pausing payroll-tax collection have frequently been raised as objections, particularly with Trump on more than one occasion saying the suspension could be made permanent should he be re-elected. The new IRS guidance isn’t a rebuttal to the skeptics, but it sketches out the order’s implementation. It’s up to employers whether they’ll participate in the tax deferral, Mnuchin has said. But until the guidance came out Friday, there was a question as to who would be responsible for getting the deferred taxes to the feds, Isberg said. Would it be workers reporting the deferral next tax season, or would it be companies doing the deferral? The guidance makes it clear that’s a job for employers, according to Isberg. “They are going to hang on to the liability and the responsibility for repaying all those taxes,” he said. Of course, workers still have to pay their taxes, just later on. If a company is deferring payroll taxes, the paychecks from January 2021 to April 2021 are going to include two deductions: one for the postponed 6.2% payments and one for the payroll-tax payments that resume in January. Isberg didn’t know how many ADP clients are going to suspend payroll tax collection; Melville said her company’s clients have been leaning away from the deferral. “In my opinion, to be more conservative, I say continue to hold and remit,” said Melville, a manager at the accounting and consulting firm headquartered in Florham Park, N.J. “By taking that conservative approach, it’s less of a headache down the road, I think.” Suppose your company decides to defer the tax. If you make less than $4,000 gross on a biweekly basis, you’ll see a bump for now in your paycheck. On an annual basis, someone meets the deferral threshold if they make less than $104,000. There are nine more biweekly pay periods between now and the end of the year, Iseberg said. That comes to $36,000 in before-tax earnings for someone making $104,000. The 6.2% portion comes to $2,232. Commissions and year-end bonuses are also subject to the deferral, he noted. The deferral is forward-looking, Isberg said. For example, he confirmed, if a company pauses payroll-tax collection in October, it can’t retroactively lump money from September tax payments. The guidance doesn’t say one way or another what happens if a company decides to participate, but its employees don’t want to, Isberg said. “Employees are going to have an opinion, right? There’s some that will want to do it and some who will absolutely not.” Companies going with the deferral are going to have to explain to staff how the arrangement will work, Isberg and Melville said. An IRS spokeswoman declined to comment beyond the guidance issued last week. Even though the IRS guidance is silent on the matter, companies should be able to explain to staff which course they are taking, Melville said. “They should be ready to answer questions, because they are going to get them.” Copyright © 2020 MarketWatch, Inc.

    "text": "Bill Ackman has an idea for saving the system that made him a billionaire. The Pershing Square Capital Management chairman told investors in a recent note that, in order to preserve capitalism, steps need to be taken to close the increasing inequality gap. One possible measure: investment accounts for every child. Under Ackman’s plan, each child born in the U.S. would receive $6,750 in a government-funded basket of index funds that could only be tapped at retirement. Assuming 8% returns over 65 years from birth to retirement, that total would ultimately exceed $1 million, and it would cost the government about $26 billion a year, if the birthrate holds. “Compounded returns over time are indeed one of the great wonders of the world, and every day we wait to address this issue, the problem looms larger,” the hedge-fund manager wrote. He added that a government-led push for equities-investing accounts could “encourage greater financial literacy” and spread the stock-market’s gains across a wider swath of the U.S. population. “Americans that have no ownership in the success of capitalism, and who are suffering economically, are more motivated to turn toward socialism or other alternatives,” he said in the note. Meanwhile, Ackman’s strong showing this year continues, thanks in large part to a well-timed bearish bet on corporate bonds in early 2020. That investment yielded a profit of more than $2 billion during the March coronavirus meltdown in the stock market.

    "text": "My husband and I have been married for almost eight years. Prior to marriage we had a prenuptial agreement made, where his RV and truck remained his to do whatever with, as my home and car remained mine. His RV is his pride and joy, and his “man cave” on wheels. I recently learned that his RV is “upside down.” He owes $75,000 more on it than it’s worth. My concern is that if something happens to him, I will end up with a lien on my home. My name is not on the RV, nor is his name on my home. Your help and thoughts are very much appreciated. Thank you. That was a clear prenuptial agreement. What’s yours is yours and what’s his is his, and anything you earn during your marriage is, I presume, shared. More or less. It sounds like you want to commingle your lives, but not your finances. Boys love their toys and he clearly takes great pride in his man cave on wheels, and it was and is important to him that it’s his, and his alone. That’s good news for you: You are not liable for this debt, if his name alone is on the loan. In community-property states — Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin — debt incurred during a marriage is deemed “community” responsibility. That is, both spouses are liable for that debt. In Alaska, newlyweds can choose to opt into community property rules. In other common-law states, spouses can incur debt on credit cards and RV loans during their marriage, and they are solely responsible for them. The Moneyist: My mother’s will says her boyfriend can live in her home after she dies. Can I still kick him out if the deed is transferred to me? There is one major exception to these rules, according to the American Bankruptcy Institute. You are liable for medical debts of your spouse under a legal theory called the Doctrine of Necessities. “The necessities rule is not limited to medical bills. It could apply to utilities, rent, food, clothing and any other necessities, but the most common lawsuit utilizing this legal concept is in the collection of medical debts,” it says. (At least two states, Virginia and Alabama, challenged this.) “In Nebraska, when you marry someone you also marry their future medical debts. If your spouse incurs medical debts during the marriage, you are liable for the debt. Even if the bills only come in the name of your spouse. Even if you did not sign for the debts. Even if you did not authorize the treatment. Even if you are separated. In Nebraska, when you marry someone you also marry their future medical debts. This doctrine has been accepted in Nebraska courts,” the institute adds. The Moneyist:My husband and I are worth $3.7 million, but I’m afraid I’ll spend my way into the poor house if he dies. When I was single, I bounced checks. What can I do? This does not, however, account for the indirect costs of a spouse incurring debts. You started your marriage with your eyes open, so you should continue in that spirit. Organize a monthly budget so you know where your red lines are on spending, and how much you need to earn to keep the books balanced, and put money aside for an emergency fund. You may also want to see if your husband can cut back on his spending to pay off his RV debt sooner rather than later. You’re a team. Worst-case scenario: If your husband cannot pay off the debt owed on his RV, it would obviously be repossessed by the company. If you or he lost his job, on the other hand, presumably the other spouse would shoulder the burden and help the other out. If he asks you to help out with the payments on his RV? That’s another question entirely. Hopefully, that won’t happen, Mary Ellen, and you and your husband will have a long and happy life together, and a few memorable trips in his RV.

    "text": "Raising children is expensive, but that hasn’t stopped Nic and Court from keeping their annual expenses below $25,000, even with a 2-year-old daughter. It helps that the two are masters at the FIRE movement, short for “Financial Independence, Retire Early.” The Calgary, Alberta, couple officially became financially independent two years ago, when their daughter was born. Nic no longer works, and Court works part-time. Even still, they save half of her salary. They live well below their means. The couple, who blog at Modern FImily, have $890,000 put away for their future, including five years’ worth of expenses in cash, and spend less than $25,000 a year. “What we are able to do now in our 30s with a child, a lot of it stems from setting us up to be in this position when we were in our 20s,” Court said. Back then, they did it so that they could pay down debts such as student loans and a mortgage while also traveling, but the financial habits they developed a decade ahead made it easier to raise a child while being financially conscious. “We never really let lifestyle creep impact us.” They don’t have cable, so they’re not influenced by advertisements, Court said. Health care is much more affordable in Canada than it is in the U.S., which naturally helps them keep their annual costs down. They’ve bought used, reliable cars so there aren’t costly repairs or monthly car payments. Much of their entertainment involves free or low-cost activities, such as ice skating on the local frozen ponds and tobogganing on hills in the winter, and walking around the neighborhood and by the creek during the summer. The only store their daughter ever sees them go to on a consistent basis is the supermarket. They cook a lot of their own meals. “We are spending all of our time with her and show her we love her that way rather than feel the need to compensate by buying toys,” Court said. Of course, they do still buy clothes and toys for their daughter, Finn, but much of those purchases are secondhand or hand-me-downs. The car seat for their daughter was new, but otherwise they often rely on online community groups to find families who want to get rid of stuff their babies never or barely used. “There might be a stigma toward hand-me-downs and secondhand, but they’re using these items for maybe a couple of months, so they’re likely in good shape,” Court said. They buy bins of clothes, sometimes with 50 different items, for around $20. Finn has a toy box that’s filled with all of her toys, and every week her parents switch out what comes out of the box, that way she can use her imagination and get creative about how they all work together. Some days, it will be toy trucks and a stroller, other days a doll. They rotate books by using the local library, as well as the little free community libraries near them (where neighbors place books in a box and pick out others to take home). They are considering welcoming a second baby into their family, and have already run the numbers for that. Nic and Court save $2,500 a year per child for college expenses, as well as have extra money set aside in their budget to account for an additional child — money that will go toward clothes, extra food, activities and so on. They’ll also have some of Finn’s old clothes and items, like a high chair and stroller, that a sibling can use. In the meantime, they will focus on teaching their daughter about money in an open way. Although Finn is only 2, they’ve already started to teach her the meaning of money. They collect and recycle their bottles for 5 cents apiece, bring her to the bottle depot and have her receive the money so that it can go in the piggy bank (except for the occasional trip for ice cream). The pair also has Finn help around the house so that she can observe them working to repair their stuff. When they were caulking the bathroom, they had their daughter sit with them and pretend to caulk (with a sealed container). When she gets older, they’ll encourage her to work, such as mowing lawns or getting a job at a coffee shop. “You learn so much from your parents and your surroundings by absorbing day-to-day life,” Court said.

    "text": "Deal talks for TikTok’s U.S. operations have hit a snag over the key question of whether the app’s core algorithms can be included as part of a deal, according to people familiar with the matter. The algorithms, which determine the videos served to users and are seen as TikTok’s secret sauce, were considered part of the deal negotiations up until Friday, when the Chinese government issued new restrictions on the export of artificial-intelligence technology, according to people familiar with the matter. Now both sides are trying to figure out whether the order means the algorithms need Chinese government approval for transfer, and if so, whether Beijing would sign off. The complexity involved has reduced the chances that a deal could be completed any time soon. TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance Ltd., has said it will comply with the Chinese government order, and is trying to get clarity from Beijing on how to proceed with a sale if the new restrictions apply to its algorithms, some of the people said. For bidders, the idea of buying TikTok without the algorithms completely changes the outlook on what the companies are bidding for, other people familiar with the situation said. They believe a large portion of the value of TikTok is in the suggestion algorithms that keep users glued to the app. An expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.

    "text": "The 52 plaintiffs, who owned around 200 U.S. stores before being forced to sell them over the last decade, are seeking compensation of $4 million to $5 million per store, according to the lawsuit. The suit was filed Tuesday in federal court in Chicago, where McDonald’s is based. According to the lawsuit, McDonald’s steered Black franchisees to stores in inner-city neighborhoods with lower sales volumes and higher security and insurance costs. The company would provide them with misleading financial information or push them to decide quickly when a store became available, the lawsuit says. Once Black franchisees owned a store, they would be asked to rebuild or remodel within a shorter period of time than white franchisees without the rent relief and other financial support given to white franchisees, the lawsuit says. Black franchise owners were also denied the chance to buy more profitable stores in better neighborhoods, it says. As a result, the plaintiffs averaged sales of $2 million per year. By comparison, McDonald’s average U.S. store brought in $2.7 million annually between 2011 and 2016 and $2.9 million in 2019, the lawsuit says. “Revenue is determined by one thing and one thing only: location,” said James Ferraro, the Miami-based attorney representing the plaintiffs. “It’s a Big Mac. They’re the same everywhere.” Ferraro also noted that the number of Black McDonald’s franchisees has fallen by half over the last two decades. The chain had 377 Black franchisees in 1998; it has 186 now. At the same time, the number of franchised restaurants has more than doubled to 36,000. McDonald’s Corp. denied the allegation and defended its history with black franchisees. “These allegations fly in the face of everything we stand for as an organization and as a partner to communities and small business owners around the world,” the company said. “Not only do we categorically deny the allegations that these franchisees were unable to succeed because of any form of discrimination by McDonald’s, we are confident that the facts will show how committed we are to the diversity and equal opportunity of the McDonald’s System, including across our franchisees, suppliers and employees.” McDonald’s has a troubled history with Black franchisees. In 1969, activists boycotted four McDonald’s in Cleveland until the company sold them to Black owners. In 1983, a Black franchise owner from Los Angeles sued the company for discrimination; McDonald’s eventually paid him $4.5 million. In 1996, McDonald’s leadership acknowledged that Black franchisees weren’t achieving parity with their white counterparts and resolved to make changes. Don Thompson, the company’s first Black president and CEO, served from 2012 to 2015. But charges of discrimination continued. In January, two Black McDonald’s executives sued the company. They claimed McDonald’s shifted advertising away from Black customers, graded Black-owned stores more harshly than white ones and implemented business plans that had a discriminatory impact on Black franchisees. At the time, McDonald’s said it disagreed with the characterization of its actions. It noted that 45% of its corporate officers and all of its field vice presidents are people of color. This cartoon apparently wasn’t fit to print, and it reportedly cost Michael de Adder his job after the internet got hold of it. Copyright © 2020 MarketWatch, Inc. All rights reserved."

    "title": "Trump lays blames with Democrats as he surveys ‘destruction’ in Kenosha, Wis.",
    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/president-trump-visits-site-of-kenosha-protests-in-wisconsin-2020-09-01?mod=home-page",
    "text": "KENOSHA, Wis. (AP) — President Donald Trump dove into the latest eruption in the nation’s reckoning over racial injustice on Tuesday, visiting the “destruction” left by rioters in Kenosha, Wis., and declaring that it had been enabled by Democratic leaders. Soon after arriving in the city, a visit made over the objections of state and local leaders, Trump toured the charred remains of a block besieged by violence and fire. He spoke to the owners of a century-old furniture store that had been destroyed and blasted the Democrats in charge of Kenosha and Wisconsin. “They just don’t want us to come in and then destruction is done,” said Trump, who has offered to send in federal enforcement. “These governors don’t want to call and the mayors don’t want to call. They have to ask.” The city has been riven by protests since the Aug. 23 shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man hit seven times in the back by police as he was getting into a car while they were trying to arrest him. On the eve of his visit, Trump defended a teenage supporter accused of fatally shooting two men at a demonstration in Kenosha last week and accused Democrat Joe Biden of siding with “anarchists” and “rioters” in the unrest. Trump’s motorcade passed a mix of supporters, many holding American flags, and protesters, some carrying signs that read Black Lives Matter. As a massive police presence, complete with several armored vehicles, secured the area, barricades were set up along several of the city’s major thoroughfares to keep onlookers some distance from the passing presidential vehicles. Wisconsin’s Democratic governor, Tony Evers, who deployed the National Guard to quell demonstrations in response to the Blake shooting, had pleaded with Trump to stay away for fear of straining tensions further. “I am concerned your presence will only hinder our healing,” Evers wrote in a letter to Trump. “I am concerned your presence will only delay our work to overcome division and move forward together.” Biden has assailed Trump over the deadly protests that have sprung up on his watch. But Trump, claiming the mantle of the “law and order” Republican candidate, has been vocal in supporting law enforcement and offered himself as the leader best positioned to keep Americans safe. He insisted his appearance in Kenosha would “increase enthusiasm” in Wisconsin, perhaps the most hotly contested battleground state in the presidential race, as the White House said he “wants to visit hurting Americans.” The White House said Trump was not going to meet with Blake’s family. Blake’s family planned a Tuesday “community celebration” to correspond with Trump’s visit. “We don’t need more pain and division from a president set on advancing his campaign at the expense of our city,” Justin Blake, an uncle, said in a statement. “We need justice and relief for our vibrant community.” The NAACP said Tuesday neither candidate should visit the Wisconsin city as tension simmers. Biden’s team has considered a visit to Kenosha and has indicated that a trip to Wisconsin was imminent but has not offered details. Biden, in his most direct attacks yet, accused Trump earlier Monday of causing the divisions that have ignited the violence. He delivered an uncharacteristically blistering speech in Pittsburgh and distanced himself from radical forces involved in altercations. Biden said of Trump: “He doesn’t want to shed light, he wants to generate heat, and he’s stoking violence in our cities. He can’t stop the violence because for years he’s fomented it.” Trump, for his part, reiterated that he blames radical troublemakers stirred up and backed by Biden. But when he was asked about one of his own supporters who was charged with killing two men during the mayhem in Kenosha, Trump declined to denounce the killings and suggested that the 17-year-old suspect, Kyle Rittenhouse, was acting in self-defense. After a confrontation in which he fatally shot one man, police say, Rittenhouse fell while being chased by people trying to disarm him. A second person was shot and killed. “That was an interesting situation,” Trump said Monday during a news conference. “He was trying to get away from them, I guess, it looks like, and he fell. And then they very violently attacked him. ... He was in very big trouble. He would have been — he probably would’ve been killed.” After Trump’s defense of Rittenhouse, Biden laced into his response, saying in a statement: “Tonight, the president declined to rebuke violence. He wouldn’t even repudiate one of his supporters who is charged with murder because of his attacks on others. He is too weak, too scared of the hatred he has stirred to put an end to it.” The president also suggested that some police officers “choke” when faced with challenging situations and offered an odd comparison, likening them to golfers who “miss a 3-foot putt.” Trump and his campaign team have seized upon the unrest in Kenosha, as well as in Portland, Oregon, where a Trump supporter was shot and killed, leaning hard into a defense of law and order while suggesting that Biden is beholden to extremists. Trump, en route to Wisconsin, lamented the shooting in Oregon and again tried to link the violence to Democratic leadership. Trump aides believe that tough-on-crime stance will help him with voters and that the more the national discourse is about anything other than the coronavirus, the better it is for the president. In the interview with Fox, Trump insisted that if he were not president, “you would have riots like you’ve never seen.” Protests in Kenosha began the night of Blake’s shooting, Aug. 23 and were concentrated in the blocks around the county courthouse downtown. The first three nights, more than 30 fires were set and numerous businesses were vandalized. There was an estimated $2 million in damage to city property, and Kenosha’s mayor has said he is seeking $30 million from the state to help rebuild. The violence reached its peak the night of Aug. 25, two days after Blake was shot, when police said a 17-year-old armed with an illegal semiautomatic rifle shot and killed two protesters in the streets. Since then marches organized both by backers of police and Blake’s family have all been peaceful with no vandalism or destruction to public property. In Pittsburgh, Biden resoundingly condemned violent protesters and called for their prosecution — addressing a key Trump critique. And the former vice president also tried to refocus the race on what has been its defining theme — Trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, which has left more than 180,000 Americans dead — after a multiday onslaught by the president’s team to make the campaign about the violence rattling American cities. Biden’s wife, Jill, on Tuesday kicked off a multiweek, 10-city tour of schools disrupted by the pandemic in eight battleground states, drawing a direct line from the empty classrooms to the administration’s failures combating COVID-19. During her tour of a Wilmington, Del., school, she spoke with teachers and administrators about doubts that in-person learning will actually resume anytime soon and the challenges — including obtaining new small desks and protective equipment to make sure classrooms can handle social distancing — if they do. She said feelings about heading back to school “have turned from excitement into anxiety, and the playgrounds are still.” President Donald Trump at a news conference on Monday evening defends his decision to visit Kenosha, Wis., as he also declines to criticize the teen accused of fatally shooting two protesters in that small city.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/nvidia-launches-new-generation-of-gaming-chips-announces-fortnite-will-introduce-ray-tracing-11598978708?mod=home-page",
    "text": "Nvidia Corp.’s stock closed at a record Tuesday as the chip company launched its new line of gaming cards and detailed more videogames that are taking advantage of the ray-tracing technology that was introduced in the previous line of graphics-processing units. Huang announced the new chips in a YouTube video Tuesday morning, similar to his announcement of new Ampere-based server chips in May. The new cards build upon Turing architecture, which brought real-time ray tracing — the rendering of realistic-looking lighting and shading — to the fore. But when RTX ray tracing made its appearance two years ago, critics argued that developers were slow in putting out enough games that took advantage of the technology. Nvidia said the RTX 3080 will be available Sept. 17, with the RTX 3090 available Sept. 24, and the RTX 3070 “sometime” in October. That will give the company about six weeks of sales of the new cards before Nvidia’s fiscal third quarter finishes up at the end of October. Nvidia said the $499 RTX 3070 runs faster than its $1,199 RTX 2080 Ti, which is currently listed as out of stock, and up to 60% faster than its original RTX 2070, which was $499 when Nvidia launched its 20-series of Turing-architecture gaming cards two years ago. The upgrade to the RTX 2070, or the “Super” version that came out in July 2019, last listed at $499. Similarly, the mid-tier $699 RTX 3080 is up to two times faster than the RTX 2080, Nvidia said. The “Super” version of the 2080 card last listed at $699. At the high end, however, Nvidia appears to be offering a deep discount on improved performance. The company said its $1,499 RTX 3090 runs up to 50% faster and 10 times quieter than its flagship Titan RTX, which last listed at $2,499. Huang said demand for the limited-run Titan “surprised us” as filmmakers were using the Titan to make 4K movies, bloggers used it to build broadcast workstations, and others used the card for applications that required its power. “There is clearly a need for a giant GPU that is available all over the world, so we made a giant Ampere,” Huang said in his presentation. Nvidia would not comment on whether it would lower prices on its 20-series Turing cards. As of market close on Tuesday, the company had yet to change 20-series card pricing on its website, and was still offering its RTX 2060 Super card at $399. Less than two weeks ago, Nvidia execs talked a lot about gaming on the company’s earnings conference call even though data-center sales had surpassed gaming for the first time ever, with Huang forecasting “this may very well be one of the best gaming seasons ever.” Shares of Eastman Kodak Co.  were up more than 20% in after-hours trading Monday after the company disclosed that D.E. Shaw & Co. has taken a 5.2% stake in the company. Kodak said in filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that D.E. Shaw has amassed 3.94 million shares of its stock. David E. Shaw is the president and sole shareholder of D.E. Shaw & Co., though the filing notes that he doesn't own any of the shares directly. Kodak shares rallied in late July after the company won a government loan to help with domestic production of pharmaceutical ingredients, but now that loan is on hold amid government scrutiny. The stock is up 128% since July 27, before the loan was reported, but it's down 82% from its July 29 peak. Kodak shares have risen 141% over the past three months as the S&P 500  has gained 15%.

    "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration says that it has recovered nearly 70% of the government relief payments that went to dead people. The Government Accountability Office said Monday it had been told by the Treasury Department that nearly 70% of the $1.6 billion that had mistakenly gone to dead people had been recovered. The GAO said it could not immediately verify that amount but said its auditors were working with Treasury to determine the exact number of payments that have been recovered. Treasury is also considering sending letters to request the return of the remaining outstanding payments, but has not moved forward with that effort yet, GAO said. Treasury said it was delaying that move because Congress is considering legislation that would clarify or make changes to payment eligibility requirements. The Senate passed a bill in June that would allow the Social Security Administration to share its full death data with the Treasury Department to prevent any future payments to dead people. The economic stimulus payments included payments of $1,200 for individuals who had income levels low enough to qualify. In an earlier report, GAO, the nonpartisan investigating arm of Congress, said that officials at the IRS and Treasury Department were aware of the risk that payments could end up going to dead people. But it was decided that speed was essential in an effort to get government support out at a time when millions of people were losing their jobs because of the coronavirus shutdowns. The economic relief payments were part of a $2.6 trillion bailout package lawmakers passed in March. Low interest rates may be here to stay, but not for all financial products.

    "title": "Natural-gas futures gain nearly 50% in August, but rally may be ‘short-lived’",
    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/natural-gas-futures-gain-nearly-50-in-august-but-rally-may-be-short-lived-2020-09-01?mod=home-page",
    "text": "Natural-gas futures rallied in August, tacking on nearly 50% to tally their largest monthly percentage gain in more than a decade as strong demand for the fuel in power generation significantly cut U.S. supplies in storage. In March, U.S. inventories of natural gas were 81% higher than the same a time year ago, but supplies recently stood at 20% above the year-ago level, according to Peter McNally, global sector lead for industrial materials and energy at investment research firm Third Bridge. The “need for backup power and peaking power demand” increased in the short term, amid blackouts in California, lifting usage of natural gas, he says. Prices saw a big increase at the beginning of August, buoyed by “strong demand from natural gas-fired power generation,” according to a monthly report from the Energy Information Administration released on Aug. 11. The EIA estimates that natural-gas consumption for power generation rose to 43.6 billion cubic feet per day in July 2020, “higher than any month on record.” Still, a decline in industrial natural-gas consumption, which fell by 1.4 billion cubic feet per day in July from a year earlier, likely due to slower economic activity, partially offset strength in consumption from electric power, the EIA said. Natural-gas production has fallen as producers have cut back on drilling and completion activities as a result of lower oil and natural-gas prices, according to the EIA, which estimates that output declined to 86.8 billion cubic feet per day in July, down 9.5 billion from the peak in November of 2019. That, combined with the rise in power generation demand, contributed to lower-than-average U.S. supply increases in July, it said. Even so, for the week ending Aug. 21, natural-gas inventories stood around 20% above the year-ago level. The market will be looking to natural-gas output that’s associated with oil production, says McNally. “Additional supplies of natural gas have emerged from the Permian Basin that produces natural gas associated with targeted oil production,” he says. “That associated gas supply has come off with oil production in recent months, but it is something we will be watching going ahead.” Meanwhile, Hurricane Laura, which made landfall in Louisiana in late August, also contributed to the climb in natural-gas prices, says Marshall Steeves, energy markets analyst IHS Markit, with the resulting production decline expected to be met with a similar fall in demand due to power losses. Prices for natural gas have climbed by nearly 80% from the year-to-date low in late June of around $1.48 Btus. However, the natural-gas supply surplus “remains formidable with the summer cooling season drawing to a close in September,” which is a transitional month, says Steeves. The natural-gas price rally may be “short-lived, absent another heat wave or supply disruption,” he says.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/coronavirus-update-global-case-tally-tops-255-million-and-us-climbs-to-603-million-as-midwest-states-suffer-rise-in-infections-2020-09-01?mod=home-page",
    "text": "The number of confirmed cases in the U.S. of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 rose to 6.03 million on Tuesday, with new cases increasing in much of the Midwest and falling from their July peaks in the South and West. The U.S. added more than 36,000 new cases on Monday, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University, while more than 480 deaths were counted. Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota counted more cases in a recent seven-day stretch than any other seen since the start of the outbreak, the New York Times reported. The U.S. accounts for about a quarter of the 25.5 million confirmed cases globally and almost a fifth of the 851,781 deaths counted by Johns Hopkins, or 183,733. On a per capita basis, the U.S. is fourth in the world with 55.95 deaths per 100,000 people, the data shows, after Peru, Chile and Brazil. Twitter removed a post that was retweeted by President Donald Trump at the weekend, claiming the U.S. death toll is greatly exaggerated. The post was sent by “Mel Q,” an adherent of the QAnon conspiracy theory. It claimed that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had updated its COVID-19 numbers and found only 9,000 of reported deaths were from the virus, while the rest were people with two or three other serious illnesses. Twitter said the post violated its coronavirus misinformation policy. The social-media site did not remove another post retweeted by Trump from a conservative website that criticized key members of Trump’s own White House task force, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Diseases, and Dr. Deborah Birx, coordinator of the task force. Fauci told ABC in an interview Tuesday that the CDC numbers did not mean that people died of causes other than COVID-19. “That does not mean that someone who has hypertension or diabetes who dies of Covid didn’t die of Covid-19. They did,” Fauci said on “Good Morning America.”  “So the numbers you’ve been hearing -- there are 180,000-plus deaths -- are real deaths from Covid-19. Let (there) not be any confusion about that.” The head of the World Health Organization said the idea that high death rates from the virus are not a concern if it’s mainly older people who are dying is “moral bankruptcy.” “Accepting someone to die because of age is moral bankruptcy at its highest, and we shouldn’t allow our society to behave this way,” WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at the agency’s latest press briefing. • Russia has more than 1 million confirmed cases of COVID-19, the English-language Moscow Times reported, the fourth highest in the world, after the U.S., Brazil and India. Russia will start its first mass deliveries of its COVID-19 vaccine this month, Health Minister Mikhail Murashko said on Monday. The governor of a remote Siberian region, the republic of Tyva on the border with Mongolia, is reported to have contracted the virus for a second time in Russia’s first such case, the paper reported. Hong Kong researchers last week confirmed a case of a patient who had been reinfected with COVID-19. That same week, two European patients were reported to have suffered that fate, the Guardian reported, citing regional public broadcasters in the Netherlands and Belgium. • Poland has banned direct flights from 44 countries, including Spain and the U.S., to contain the spread of the virus, the Guardian reported, citing government officials. India, Brazil, Argentina, Malta, Montenegro, Mexico, Israel and Romania are also on the list, the paper reported, but China and Russia have been removed, local media reported. The ban will become effective on Wednesday. Poland has 67,922 confirmed cases of the virus, according to the Johns Hopkins data, and 2,058 people have died. • Tourism traffic to Spain fell 75% in July from the year-earlier period, according to Spain’s National Statistics Institute, costing the country billions of euros in lost revenue. Spain is currently grappling with a fresh spike in cases, after recording almost 24,000 new infections over the weekend. In the past two weeks, Spain has seen more than 96,000 new infections, according to its health ministry, making it a hot spot for the outbreak for the second time. Madrid is the epicenter, with about 16% of area hospital beds currently occupied by COVID-19 patients. • Hong Kong launched a mass testing program on Tuesday, amid heightened tensions with mainland China following its efforts to crack down on the city’s democracy movement. The free scheme has had a shaky start, amid concerns that the involvement of doctors and testing companies from the mainland will lead to harvesting of DNA and other data, the Washington Post reported. “I’m postulating that in the most optimistic case, perhaps a million people will turn up, but if I say that, I will be announced as unpatriotic,” said Gabriel Choi Kin, head of the Hong Kong Medical Association, the paper reported. “Ultimately, this will be a display of whether citizens trust the government.” • More than a million students returned to schools in the Chinese city of Wuhan on Tuesday, the original source of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to media reports. Wuhan was locked down for more than two months starting in late January and has reopened gradually since April. About 3,869 inhabitants of the city died from the virus, according to official Chinese data, accounting for more than 80% of China’s total official death toll of 4,724. Students had their temperatures taken at the school gates and were given lessons on hand washing, according to the New York Times. At least 16.9 million people have tested positive and then recovered from COVID-19, the Johns Hopkins data show. Brazil is second to the U.S. with 3.9 million cases and 121,381 deaths. India is next with 3.7 million cases and 65,228 deaths. Mexico has 599,560 cases but 64,414 deaths, the fourth highest in the world. The U.K. has 338,085 cases and 41,589 deaths, the highest in Europe and fifth highest in the world. AstraZeneca said the Phase III trial is seeking up to 30,000 participants to test the vaccine, designated as AZD1222. Participants will either receive two doses of AZD1222 or a saline placebo four weeks apart. In July, AstraZeneca said an early-to-mid-stage study showed the vaccine was “well tolerated and generated robust immune responses” against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. American manufacturers grew again in August for the fourth straight month, but companies still aren’t bringing back lots of workers or seeking to increase investment with the coronavirus pandemic still infecting the economy, MarketWatch’s Jeffry Bartash reported. The Institute for Supply Management said its manufacturing index rose to 56% in August from 54.2% in July. Readings over 50% indicate growth. Economists surveyed by MarketWatch had forecast the index to total 54.9%. Althought the index hit a 21-month high, manufacturers aren’t doing as well now as they were two years ago. Businesses executives are asked if their companies are doing better or worse compared with the prior month, but the survey doesn’t reveal how much better. Most manufacturers are producing fewer goods with fewer workers than they were before the coronavirus pandemic. The index had fallen to an 11-year low of 41.5% in April during the height of the crisis. The index for new orders jumped to 67.6% from 61.5%, marking the highest level since 2004. Yet other measures of actual production show new orders are actually still about 5% below precrisis levels. The production gauge rose to 63.3% from 62.1%. Timothy Fiore, chairman of the survey, said executives were “generally optimistic” but “to a lesser degree compared with July.” Coronavirus cases spiked during the summer and sapped the economy of some of the momentum built up in May and June. “Not all firms have the capacity to bring all of their staff back from furlough and those that do face difficult challenges in figuring out how and when to safely bring their workers back to work,” economists Thomas Simons and Aneta Markowska of Jefferies LLC wrote to clients. These tech companies have yet to report financial results for the quarter but have demonstrated they are benefiting from the pandemic.

    "text": "Over the roughly week and a half that Ian Katsnelson has been back at his college, the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, the junior has developed a “mini competition” with his friends to see who can finish the process of taking their COVID-19 tests the fastest. “The hardest part for sure is garnering enough saliva,” Katsnelson said of the rapid saliva test, which was created by scientists at the school. He’s perfecting his strategy for his trips to the tents where testing takes place: “I’ve built up my saliva in line before I’ve even gotten inside the tent, so I can get in and get out real quick.” Hallie Workman, a PhD candidate in communications at U of I said, “there’s a lot of scouting that goes on” as students try to find out which of the more than a dozen testing tents on campus have the shortest line. “I have my tent in my time of day that always works well,” Workman, 30, said. “You just sit there trying not to make eye contact with people as you dribble spit into a tube.” These were just some of the rituals that marked an unusual first week of classes at the University of Illinois, which is requiring students, faculty and staff accessing campus to get tested for COVID-19 twice a week as part of its reopening plan. As colleges across the country have sent students home or back to remote classes amid COVID outbreaks, officials at the University of Illinois are hopeful that their approach to mitigating the pandemic’s spread on campus — which includes a test developed at the school that is now being performed under the Federal Drug Administration’s emergency use authorization — will be enough to keep students in some in-person classes through November.  It’s not a small undertaking. The school had 51,000 students in the fall of 2019. Since July 6, the school has processed 121,333 COVID tests and in the five days leading up to Friday, which marked the end of the first week of classes, the school administered 47,075 tests and had a 0.75% positivity rate. For context, there were roughly 730,000 COVID tests administered in the entire U.S. on a recent August day, according to Johns Hopkins University’s Coronavirus Resource Center. On Aug. 24, U of I administered more than 17,000 tests alone. So far, the number of positive cases is in line with what the school’s modelers predicted — well under 400 cases in the week before classes began. The next couple of weeks will be a “defining moment” for U of I as it works to prevent the spread of COVID-19 on campus and in the community, said Robert Jones, the school’s chancellor. “We know that people are watching,” he told MarketWatch. And indeed, according to Joshua Salomon, the director of the Prevention Policy Modeling Lab at Stanford University, “people are really going to be watching this carefully,” describing the efforts the school has taken as “encouraging.” “We don’t know whether it’s going to succeed,” he added. “What we do know is that the likelihood of succeeding without testing is very small.” At many universities that have reopened their campuses for in-person instruction, students may have been tested upon reentry to university housing or campus more broadly and may be subject to random screening. But models from researchers at Yale School of Public Health and U of I, indicate that in order to prevent an outbreak on a college campus — and not just monitor one — students and those interacting with them regularly need to be tested multiple times per week. U of I may be the only university in the country hewing to that standard. Officials will know around Sept. 25, one month and one day after the start of classes, if their efforts have worked, said Rebecca Lee Smith, an associate professor of pathobiology at U of I who is part of the team that developed the school’s testing and other protocols. “We’re going to be keeping track of how well we’re doing going from test results to isolation to contact tracing and quarantine,” Smith said. They’ll also be looking out for new positive cases, a sign of community spread. The outcome that they’re hoping for “is to minimize the infections, get it under control and to protect the health of campus and the community,” Smith said. The school began working to prepare for the fall semester shortly after classes went remote in the spring, said Martin Burke, a chemistry professor at the University of Illinois and chair of the SHIELD committee, the team that is guiding the university’s approach to reopening. They realized relatively quickly that in order to bring students back to campus, they would need to test frequently and get results back rapidly, something that wasn’t going to be possible with a nasal swab test. That led to what Burke described as a “Manhattan Project-style effort,” at the university  to develop their own test. Ultimately they were able to do so in about six weeks, he said. Now the school is working to expand access to the test to the rest of the state of Illinois and even to other areas of the country and around the world. “Testing is not a silver bullet, but it’s a very powerful component,” Burke said. In addition to the testing, the school developed an app where students, faculty and staff receive test results and reminders, and a boarding pass-style image indicating a negative COVID test that allow them access to campus buildings. Users can also enable the app to notify them when they’ve been in close proximity to someone who tested positive for COVID through the use of an anonymized Bluetooth scanning system. U of I is also taking many of the same steps as other campuses  — moving large lecture courses online, moving smaller in-person courses to large rooms to allow for social distancing and requiring masks. The school also has “every high expectation” of students, Jones said. “By agreeing to come back and be here that they have to take ownership to keep themselves safe.” Those who are participating in on-campus activities and don’t follow testing and isolation guidelines could be subject to student discipline. For a university to have a shot at reopening successfully, it needs to hold classes online or outside when possible, have a good system for testing and contact tracing, and have clear and transparent metrics for when it will change course, Salomon said. (Asked about what would trigger a move to remote instruction, Jones said “one of the key metrics, we’re keeping our eye on is the number of positive cases.”) All of these are costly  and administratively challenging undertakings. Jones said his best “guesstimate” is that the school’s testing component alone will cost $7 to $10 million per semester. But a major obstacle to any successful reopening, is just the status of the spread of the virus itself, Salomon said. “We’re still very much in the middle of a raging pandemic,” he said. “With that amount of transmission in communities and bringing together students from around the country, we know that there will be people infected upon arrival. It raises the bar on what needs to be done to interrupt transmission and cut it off.” During the first week of classes, when the school onboarded tens of thousands of students, “the main hiccup” in its system was turning test results around fast enough so that students, faculty and staff would have access to buildings they needed to be in for class, Smith said. Those who haven’t had a negative test result in the last four days can’t get into university buildings, except their own residence hall. Still, the school has been turning test results around “well within” the 48 hour window they’ve promised, she said. Workman was one of those affected by the hiccup. She got tested on a Monday, which was one of the testing days assigned to her by the school, but didn’t get her results back in time to teach her 8 a.m. Tuesday class in person. She “had to call an audible and tell my class we were meeting on Zoom.” When the two public speaking classes she was teaching started last week, roughly 5% of her students couldn’t attend because they’d tested positive for the virus, Workman said. That’s one metric Workman said she’ll be keeping an eye on as she evaluates whether to keep teaching in person. If enough students can’t attend class face-to-face because of quarantine or isolation, she’ll transition to remote instruction, though her preference is to continue teaching in-person classes — the widespread testing has made her feel comfortable doing so. Owen Stephenson was eager to come to campus for his freshman year to gain some independence, even if he would be taking most of his classes online. So far, he’s felt like the testing has gone smoothly; he received his first two test results on the same day he tested and his only quibble was a 45-minute wait on a weekend, when there are fewer testing tents available. The required testing is part of what makes Stephenson feel like he can keep himself safe, regardless of other students’ behavior. “Their testing is the only thing that sets them apart from other universities trying to go back,” he said of U of I’s plan. From her observations in class, Workman said it seems as if students are committed to making the school’s reopening program work because they want to stick around for the semester. Still, she said, the changes to the college experience required during this time — more rules for engaging on campus, more online courses than typical — have left her students so drained that she ended a recent class 20 minutes early. “They had this feeling that once they were finally able to get back on campus, that life would feel more normal and it’s not.” Unlike the earlier $600 extra unemployment benefit, some 1 million unemployed Americans will be ineligible for this $300 weekly boost.

    "text": "This interview is the third in a series of conversations MarketWatch is conducting with some of the leading voices in the U.S. on the COVID-19 pandemic. Back in April, Dr. Dixie Harris and about 100 nurses and doctors from the Intermountain Healthcare hospital system in Utah flew to New York City to work in the region’s overburdened hospitals. Harris, a pulmonologist who studies e-cigarette vaping, worked for days in a row, caring for COVID-19 patients when the region’s local hospitals were overwhelmed. It was at Southside Hospital in Bay Shore, N.Y., that she started to learn about the virus, about why it’s better to put patients prone, why ventilators aren’t always the best option — and the importance of wearing a face mask. “One hundred of us went,” she said. “Zero came back positive.” Back home in the much more sparsely populated state of Utah, cases peaked at 876 on July 9, according to the Utah Department of Health. About 400 people in total have died as a result of a COVID-19 infection. (New York state has reported a total of 430,774 cases and 25,297 deaths as of Aug. 25.) As cases have declined, more of Harris’ focus has turned to patients who had COVID-19 in the spring and are still dealing with myriad health problems and symptoms months later. Many of these patients in the U.S. call themselves “long haulers.” They have reported fatigue, chest pain and neurological damage. “One of my first long-hauler patients had symptoms in March,” she said. “Five months later, and this patient was never in the hospital. That’s who I’m mostly seeing: patients who haven’t been in the hospital but continue to have ongoing symptoms.” Dr. Dixie Harris: We were there three weeks in April. It was pretty intense. It was right as the peak was going down, but there were still six times the number of ICU patients or more for the hospital I was working in. From what I could see, it hit pretty much within a week. It went from next to no COVID patients to overwhelming the whole system. I’ve had other people ask me, “Why didn’t they just ship some of those patients to another hospital?” Well, every hospital in Long Island was overrun with patients. And all the ambulances were so busy bringing new patients in, it’s not like they could say, “Oh, we’ll take this one patient all the way up to Albany. “ A tsunami is what they called it because there was no warning and it hit all at once. It was an incredibly dynamic learning environment. From when we started to when I left, care changed markedly. We were intubating early on. And then we said, “Wait a second, once they go on the ventilator, they’re on for three weeks. What can we do to avoid this?” The big key is proning. Even if you get some respiratory symptoms but you don’t have to be in the hospital, go ahead and move. Prone. Don’t just lay in the bed on your back at home. I will say it’s really hard to lay on your belly when your BMI is 45. When you’re really obese, it feels like you can’t breathe. So I tell the patients to sit up, lean forward. You’re trying to get the back upright. It was an honor to get to go there. The head of Northwell Health came when we were leaving about to get on the plane and came in to thank us. They did a water cannon salute in New York at the airport. When we were in the waiting area right at the jet way, probably 30, 40 people showed up and just gave us a shout-out clap. All wearing masks, all distanced. MarketWatch: It looks like Utah’s peak was in July. How is it different caring for patients there even now? Harris: We haven’t been overwhelmed. We have not had our ICUs completely full and so because of that we’re doing cutting edge best care possible. Every COVID patient is presented to infectious disease to decide which meds they qualify for. Harris: The laypeople are calling it long haulers. The British Medical Journal just did a nice review on management of post-acute COVID patients. They’re calling it long COVID. In the medical community, we haven’t fully named it. But I’m [also] aware of patients who consider themselves long haulers who have never (been) diagnosed positive for COVID. They feel they have it because they have the symptoms, the time frame, and all that. Harris: That’s really what we are just learning. Who I get are patients who two to three months later are still having shortness of breath, still having aches and pains, and maybe chest symptoms. Many of them are still on oxygen. Now mind you, we are at higher elevation. So some of these patients would not necessarily be hypoxic if they were at sea level. Still, these are people who are used to living here, so their body is adjusted to it. Dr. Kirk Knowlton, [Intermountain’s director of cardiovascular research, critical care physician Dr. Eliotte Hirshberg] and I are going to be talking to our leadership about developing protocols to take care of these patients. Part of it is to acknowledge that patients are still having symptoms. One of my first long-hauler patients had symptoms in March. I talked to the patient a week and a half ago, and he is still having a little bit of symptoms [but is] markedly better. Back to work now. But five months later, and this patient was never in the hospital. That’s who I’m mostly seeing: patients who haven’t been in the hospital but continue to have ongoing symptoms. In the BMJ article that just was published, they’re saying that 10% of patients who test positive remain unwell after three weeks. Their definition is if you have symptoms more than three weeks, you’re going into the long haulers. A lot of people are calling long haulers a month out. My colleague and I are presenting to our leadership — he’s a cardiologist, and I’m a pulmonologist — but we’re the ones who are aware of these cases two, three, four, or five months later. The fatigue and the memory issues. Depression. There’s a lot of non-pulmonary issues. Muscle aches. Anxiety. Everybody’s anxious in the day of COVID, right? Everybody’s stressed. Everybody’s had to adjust and learn. Primary care’s going to be addressing more and more of this. And our psychiatric services are going to be seeing this. My long haulers, most of them are on oxygen, and they all have pulmonary symptoms. But every time I see them, they’re a little bit better. I do see improvement over time. I will say that things such as prolonged symptoms — fatigue, that kind of thing — has been reported in MERS and SARS. MarketWatch: It’s not just a respiratory illness. Harris: Right. It’s a blood vessel illness. It’s a brain illness. It’s a muscle illness. MarketWatch: You’ve done some research around vaping and smoking. How do you talk to patients about these types of things in the context of COVID? Harris: It’s pretty well established that vaping nicotine does weaken the immune system. It especially affects how the nose can fight viruses. And how does COVID get in the system? Eyes, nose, mouth, right? You saw more cases of EVALI (e-cigarette, or vaping, product use associated lung injury) in April and May. A lot of the EVALI, like 90% to 95%, is due to the tainted THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) oil. [THC is the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis that makes people feel “high.”] I think people are going to THC with the stress of all the quarantines and all the changes. It makes sense people are reaching for that. Whatever you do, don’t vape the THC. This Q&A has been edited for clarity and length. • Dr. Osterholm: Americans will be living with the coronavirus for decades Shares of Eastman Kodak Co.  were up more than 20% in after-hours trading Monday after the company disclosed that D.E. Shaw & Co. has taken a 5.2% stake in the company. Kodak said in filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that D.E. Shaw has amassed 3.94 million shares of its stock. David E. Shaw is the president and sole shareholder of D.E. Shaw & Co., though the filing notes that he doesn't own any of the shares directly. Kodak shares rallied in late July after the company won a government loan to help with domestic production of pharmaceutical ingredients, but now that loan is on hold amid government scrutiny. The stock is up 128% since July 27, before the loan was reported, but it's down 82% from its July 29 peak. Kodak shares have risen 141% over the past three months as the S&P 500  has gained 15%.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-what-to-know-about-abbotts-15-minute-covid-19-test-11598982464?mod=home-page",
    "text": "On Aug. 26, the Food and Drug Administration granted an Emergency Use Authorization to a new rapid antigen test for COVID-19 called the BinaxNOW test. I study public health policy to combat infectious disease epidemics. Testing is one of the most powerful tools available to fight the spread of COVID-19. The new test is inexpensive, rapid and easy to use. It will massively scale up access to testing, but hurdles remain in achieving widespread, frequent COVID-19 testing. The credit-card-sized test is an antigen test that detects a specific viral protein from SARS-CoV-2. It costs $5 and doesn’t require a lab or a machine for processing. Performing the test is simple. A health-care worker or technician would use a swab to collect a sample from less than 1 inch inside the nostril. They would then combine the sample with a few drops of chemicals inside the test card. Within 15 minutes, the test strip would show a positive or negative result. The test is also paired with an app that produces a digital code that can be scanned to show proof of a recent negative COVID-19 test. The BinaxNOW test is currently only authorized for patients who have had COVID-19 symptoms for seven days or less, which is when virus levels in the body are likely to be high. It must be prescribed by a physician and performed by a trained technicianor other health-care worker. The PCR test for COVID-19 is currently widely used and considered the gold standard, but requires patient samples to be sent to a lab and can take days to provide results. The new antigen test is designed to be a cheap and quick alternative to PCR testing for diagnostic purposes in a medical setting. It would add critical capacity to an overstretched testing system. The emergency use authorization provides preliminary authorization for doctors to prescribe the antigen test while the full FDA approval process is ongoing. The authorization could be revoked if the test is not as accurate or reliable as expected. However, the true accuracy could be lower because the performance testing group was only 102 people and the accuracy hasn’t been validated by the FDA as part of the full approval process. There will inevitably be some false negatives and false positives with the BinaxNOW test since accuracy isn’t 100%, but the FDA will monitor the data to make sure the test meets the reported accuracy. The BinaxNOW test is cheap, rapid, able to be mass-produced and easy to use outside a lab. This makes it a promising candidate for widespread screening. However, the test is currently only authorized for people with COVID-19 symptoms. This is an obstacle because an estimated 40% of all COVID-19 cases are asymptomatic and these people likely don’t know that they’re contagious. To maximize the effectiveness of any COVID-19 screening program, it is important to test people whether they have symptoms or not. Health-care providers are able to prescribe the BinaxNOW test for asymptomatic patients for off-label use, but health officials don’t yet know how accurate the test is when performed on asymptomatic people. The massive expansion of testing access made possible by the BinaxNOW test will almost surely outweigh the downsides of a small number of inaccurate results. Abbott plans to manufacture 50 million tests per month starting in October. This will quickly exceed the 76 million COVID-19 tests the U.S. has performed over the last six months. Widespread, frequent testing is effective at slowing the spread of the coronavirus. The new testing capacity made possible by the authorization of this rapid antigen test represents a major advance in bringing the pandemic under control. Zoë McLaren is an associate professor of public policy at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. This was first published by The Conversation — “Will the new 15-minute COVID-19 test solve US testing problems?“ A bearish analyst on Tesla Inc.  is now a little less bearish, saying the electric vehicle maker has become one of the most important stocks in the U.S. stock market, but said the stock remains fundamentally overvalued. The stock surged 6.8% in premarket trading Tuesday, after soaring 12.6% on Monday. RBC Capital's Joseph Spak lifted is price target to $290, which implies a 42% drop from Monday's record close of $498.32, from $170, while maintaining the underperform rating he's had on the stock since January 2019. \"We recognize we underestimated a critical valuation point: seemingly insatiable investor demand for alternative/clean vehicles,\" Spak wrote in a note to clients. He said he also believes investors have willing to show more patience and look further out for companies like Tesla. \"That being said, we struggle to explain the run-up to the stock split which academically doesn't change the value of Tesla equity but could help fuel investor interest,\" Spak wrote. \"We still view Tesla as fundamentally overvalued and having to grow into its valuation.\" Of the 36 analysts surveyed by FactSet, just 19% are bullish, 31% are bearish, and 50% are neutral. Since Tesla announced the 5-for-1 stock split after the Aug. 11 close, the stock has soared 81.3% through Monday, while the S&P 500  has gained 5.0%. Copyright © 2020 MarketWatch, Inc.

    "title": "Rocket Reports Earnings Tomorrow. What to Expect.",
    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/rocket-reports-earnings-tomorrow-what-to-expect-51598999503?mod=home-page",
    "text": "Since its public offering, Rocket’s shares (ticker: RKT) have risen 38%, helped by the company’s preliminary second-quarter earnings released in mid-August as part of financial disclosures to bondholders. The company reported net revenue of $5 billion, a 437% increase from the same quarter in 2019, and adjusted Ebitda, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, of $3.8 billion, up 868% from the second quarter last year, the company said in a press release, owing to an elevated gain on sale margin as well as an increase in rate-lock volume. The company will report its official second-quarter earnings on Wednesday. Analysts anticipate generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) earnings of $1.39 per share on sales of $5.3 billion and Ebitda of $3.8 billion. Here are three things analysts are looking for. Bank vs. Tech Even before the company priced its IPO, there were debates about whether investors should value Rocket as a tech company or a mortgage originator. “On one hand, the value of their tech platform and ability to disrupt is significant,” writes Wells Fargo analysts Donald Fandetti, Michael Kaye, and Steven DeBartolo, who initiated coverage at the equivalent of Neutral with a price target of $29. “On the other hand, almost all of their revenue is from mortgage gain on sale which is volatile.” While analysts see the opportunity for Rocket, already the biggest player in the mortgage origination game, to secure a greater share in a highly-fragmented market using its proprietary digital platform, that market itself is highly cyclical, which could cut into earnings when sky-high refinance volumes return to earth. In its preliminary report, the company attributed its second-quarter growth in earnings to increased demand for mortgages and capacity constraints in the industry, which drove a 5.19% gain on sale margin, up from 3.22% over the same period in 2019. Looking farther ahead, analysts expect earnings per share of $3.16 for 2020 and $1.46 for 2021 according to FactSet, as capacity constraints decrease and Rocket’s currently elevated gain on sale margin falls. The second quarter “represented almost the perfect confluence of events” for an elevated high gain on sale margin, JP Morgan analysts write, citing falling rates, originator capacity constraints due to the surge in volume, and heightened demand for mortgage-backed securities due to Federal Reserve actions. “While we would normally expect [gain on sale margins] to remain between 3 and 4%, RKT generated a blended gain on sale of [5.19%], a level that is unlikely to be repeated within our modeled horizon.” “Origination volumes and margins are difficult to forecast given dependence on rates and competitor behavior,” writes a team of analysts led by Jason Kupferberg at BofA, who initiated at Buy with a $32 price target. Investors saw this sensitivity to rates play out in mid-August after government-sponsored entities Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac announced a 50 basis-point fee on refinances. Rocket shares fell 6.3% on the news, which critics warned would stymie refinance volume in the long-term and compel originators to cover the fee for locked-in borrowers in the short-term. The implementation of that fee has since been delayed until December. Even as analysts worry about Rocket’s exposure to mortgage rates, they see the company’s tech platform as well-positioned for growth. Rocket Mortgage’s first-quarter market share of the mortgage industrywas 9.2%, according to documents filed with the SEC, which the company aims to grow to 25% in 10 years, CEO Jay Farner said previously. “The biggest question mark in our model is how RKT deploys the significant amounts of capital generated in the coming quarters,” write a team of Barclays analysts led by Mark C. DeVries, indicating that the company is likely to reinvest a portion of returns into building its tech platform. Barclays initiated coverage at Neutral with a price target of $25. “Management suggested that there were some smaller opportunities on the horizon from an M&A perspective, and we get the sense that potential deals would focus on the real estate technology market over origination sensitive opportunities.” Analysts see the expansion of this program as key in the growth of market share. “Although a lower margin business, Partner Network volumes represent attractive business for Rocket as it brings additional customers into the servicing portfolio, where Rocket will have a chance to recapture future refinances on the mortgage,” the Barclays team wrote. A team of BofA analysts led by Jason Kupferberg also sees an expansion of Rocket’s partner network as a boon for growth. The analysts, who rate RKT shares a Buy with a price target of $32, noted that, while the partner network generates lower gain-on-sale margins, client acquisition costs are also lower. The company’s press release announcing preliminary results did not report direct-to-consumer and partner network segments separately, so Wednesday’s report will be the first look at both segments’ second-quarter performance. It’s a great time to be a mortgage originator with Rocket’s business model. The housing market’s recovery has seen demand for purchase mortgages and refinance loans remain elevated above 2019 levels for months. While some originators may struggle to match recent surging demand, Rocket is able to scale because of its tech platform, analysts say. “We believe RKT’s tech platform allows them to seamlessly handle spikes in volume, where many peer banks hit a capacity ceiling,” Wells Fargo analysts wrote. Rocket’s digital model also allows it to take advantage of another trend in the market, analysts write: digital-first millennials. “Rocket is well-positioned to take advantage of favorable demographic trends as millennials enter peak home purchasing age and expect a digital mortgage process,” write a team of J.P. Morgan analysts led by Richard Shane who initiated coverage at Neutral with a price target of $31. The surge of millennials in the market is one of two catalysts for short-term growth, wrote a RBC team led by Daniel R. Perlin who rate the company’s shares Outperform with a price target of $32. “U.S. demographics are on Rocket’s side, as millennials represent ~40% of new home buyers and rely heavily on technology for the buying process,” they wrote. That’s not the only demographic Rocket could cater to. RBC identified another near-term catalyst for the stock: nearly $11 trillion in mortgage debt outstanding from current homeowners that would benefit from refinancing at lower rates.

    "title": "Tesla Is Raising Cash. This Isn’t Your Typical Stock Offering.",
    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/tesla-raising-cash-not-your-typical-stock-offering-51598973302?mod=home-page",
    "text": "The company plans to use cash to “further strengthen our balance sheet, as well as for general corporate purposes,” according to the prospectus. That is standard language. More specifically, Tesla (ticker: TSLA) might use the money to build additional manufacturing capacity. Its next plant is planned for Austin, Texas. Currently, Tesla has facilities in California, Nevada, and Shanghai, as well as one under construction in Berlin. The company wasn’t immediately available to comment on future capacity plans. The offering is a little different than other stock sales. “At the market” means “investors who purchase shares in this offering at different times will likely pay different prices.” There is no one block of stock being allocated by bookrunners. That is a bad sign to some. GLJ analyst Gordon Johnson believes it’s a sign that institutional demand is drying up for Tesla stock, and that retail investors are driving the offering. “If they need the cash, that’s a problem with the story,” Johnson tells Barron’s. It’s a bearish take, but Johnson is indeed a bear. He rates Tesla Sell and has a mere $17.40 price target, the lowest target price on Wall Street for a stock that trades around $500. Not everyone feels as Johnson does. New Street Research analyst Pierre Ferragu is fine with the capital raise. “At these levels, it is more or less free money,” Ferragu tells Barron’s. It’s a good idea to raise capital when companies can get it. “Why not raise $20 billion?” asks Ferragu rhetorically. “They don’t want to upset their shareholders either.” The amount being raised is a fraction of Tesla’s market value. The dilution, according to the analyst, is easy for the market to digest. Ferragu rates shares Hold, with a price target of $300. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives rates shares Hold too, with a $380 price target. Ives falls on the side of Ferragu, believing the raise is a good idea. “This is the smart move at the right time for Musk & Co. after the parabolic rally in shares,” wrote Ives in a Tuesday research report. The entire EV sector, in fact, is on fire. The EV stocks Barron’s tracks are up more than 300% year to date on average. The rally has been catalyzed, in large part, because of Tesla’s success. The company has produced a string of better-than-expected delivery and earnings results, propelling shares higher. EV technology has made great gains recently—a fact reflected in stock prices. Still, investors should be a little wary of all the capital flowing into the sector—it can be a sign of a market top. That doesn’t necessarily mean a dip will come; recent gains could also be consolidated with the sector trading sideways for a while. Of course, another possibility is that shares keeps rising. It has certainly been tough to bet against EV stock in 2020.

    "title": "Only 19% of Tesla analysts say buy the stock while investors remain ‘insatiable’",
    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/only-19-of-tesla-analysts-say-buy-the-stock-while-investors-remain-insatiable-2020-09-01?mod=home-page",
    "text": "There is an old Wall Street saying that investing isn’t about being right or wrong, it’s about making money. No one understands that better than an investor in Tesla Inc.’s stock. The financial fundamentals and the historical valuations of earnings suggest the market is wrong about the electric vehicle (EV) maker’s stock price, according to the overwhelming majority of Tesla analysts. But the stock keeps rising and Tesla investors keep making money. No one is making more money than Elon Musk, Tesla’s chief executive officer, largest shareholder and arguably its most important cheerleader, who just became the third-richest person in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak, who has been bearish on Tesla since Jan. 23 2019, when the stock closed at $57.52, put it this way in a note to clients: Spak raised his price target to $290 from $170, but his target was still 42% below Monday’s closing price. See related: His short position just got ‘obliterated,’ but this Tesla bear isn’t giving up. Also read: Tesla takes advantage of stock’s best month in 7 years with $5 billion offering. There are some fundamental reasons for investors being right to buy, as Tesla has been profitable for four straight quarters, while Wall Street was wrong to expect losses in three of the past four quarters. And despite concerns about the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, Tesla delivered way more EVs than expected during the second quarter. While the 5-for-1 stock split Tesla announced on Aug. 11 didn’t improve the company’s fundamentals in any way, investors were right to buy or hold on to their shares, for now, as the price has charged up more than 80% since the announcement through Monday. Read more: Tesla stock rally accelerates further into record territory after split takes effect. Despite such strong investor conviction, 81% of analysts don’t recommend buying. Of the 36 analysts surveyed by FactSet, only seven, or 19%, have the equivalent of buy ratings on Tesla’s stock. And only one of those analysts, Jefferies’s Philippe Houchois, had a price target — $500 — that was above Monday’s closing price. Meanwhile, half the analysts had the equivalent of hold ratings and 11 analysts, or 31%, had the equivalent of sell ratings. The average price target of all the analysts was $261.85, according to FactSet, which implied a 47% drop from Monday’s closing price. Most of what analysts have been wrong about Tesla has taken place over roughly the past five months. At the end of March, when the COVID-19 crisis was full blown, there were the same number of bearish analysts as there are now and the average stock price target was $101.86, just 2.8% below the March 31 closing price of $104.80. With the stock’s gain since then, Tesla’s market capitalization increased to $464.3 billion as of Monday’s close, which was the seventh highest among U.S. companies. RBC’s Spak suggested that what may also keep supporting the stock is that given the sheer market valuation of Tesla, many portfolio managers have to add to positions “just to keep pace.” He also believes investors have been willing to show more patience and look further into the future to value the stock. “We still view Tesla as fundamentally overvalued and having to grow into its valuation,” Spak wrote. Spak recognizes that Tesla is clearly ahead of its competition, has relatively inexpensive access to capital, the ability to attract talent, an “incredible” brand, and understands that “narrative, momentum and other factors” can impact the stock price. But he still believes that ultimately, a company’s value is related to fundamental factors. Basically, he’s suggesting that one of the biggest risk factors to Tesla’s stock isn’t good or bad fundamental news, but how investors value that news. The next major potential news catalyst is Tesla’s “battery day” scheduled for Sept. 22, of which Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said recently he’s expecting a number of potential “game changing” developments. One of those developments is the “million mile” battery, which in theory will support an EV for 1 million miles, which could put Tesla miles ahead of its traditional gasoline-powered automotive competitors. That said, Ives is one of the analysts that doesn’t recommend buying — he’s at hold — while his price target of $380 suggests the stock could fall 24%. For those looking for actual fundamental risks, the following are just some of those included in the more than 20 pages of “risk factors” Tesla lists in its latest quarterly report filed on July 28. So far, those risks haven't mattered to Tesla investors. • “We are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer.” • “We have been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by the global COVID-19 pandemic, the duration and economic, governmental and social impact of which is difficult to predict, which may significantly harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.” • “We have experienced in the past, and may experience in the future, delays or other complications in the design, manufacture, launch, and production ramp of our vehicles, energy products, and product features, or may not realize our manufacturing cost targets, which could harm our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.” • “Our future growth and success is dependent upon consumers’ willingness to adopt electric vehicles and specifically our vehicles. We operate in the automotive industry, which is generally susceptible to cyclicality and volatility.” • “Any issues or delays in meeting our projected timelines, costs and production at or funding the ramp of Gigafactory Shanghai, or any difficulties in generating and maintaining local demand for vehicles manufactured there, could adversely impact our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition.” • “If our vehicles or other products that we sell or install fail to perform as expected, our ability to develop, market and sell our products and services could be harmed.” • “The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and we may not be successful in competing in these industries. We currently face competition from new and established domestic and international competitors and expect to face competition from others in the future, including competition from companies with new technology.” It was another wild day for Kodak stock.

    "text": "At the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, close to eight of 10 MBA students say they are not excited about the coming fall semester because the coronavirus pandemic has forced classes online. At UCLA’s Anderson School of Management, newly admitted international students are outraged that they cannot defer their admission to the school’s MBA program even if they cannot get a student visa to come to the U.S. At New York University’s Stern School of Business, students are demanding the reversal of a 3.5% increase in MBA tuition during COVID-19 and asking for a 5% to 10% discount on the price of their degrees because of the shift to virtual classes. Add to all of the anxiety and frustration the fact that some graduates from the most prestigious business schools, including Harvard and Stanford universities, saw their summer internships and full-time job offers clawed back by companies due to the COVID recession. Many more are deeply worried about their prospects for landing a job over the next year as still more companies freeze budgets and hiring plans. So is this a time to apply to an MBA program and go even further into debt? You better believe it is, and here’s why. A recession and a health crisis, no matter how severe, will not last forever. But while it lasts, many will find their opportunities to advance at work diminished or completely curtailed. Many more have already found themselves on unemployment. By the time this year’s incoming MBA students graduate in 2023, it is almost a certainty that both COVID-19 and the economic downturn will be in the rearview mirror. The Class of 2023 will inevitably graduate into a fully recovered economy, better prepared to take full advantage of the upturn. No less crucial, they will have been the beneficiaries of not merely the business basics or of the leadership development a strong MBA program provides; they will be steeped in both data analytics, specifically how to smartly harness massive datasets for decision making, and how to leverage new technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, to gain important efficiencies in a business moving forward. Of all the graduate degrees you could earn, an MBA from a highly selective business school is pretty much a no-brainer investment. The top five schools for average starting pay last year — base salary plus signing bonus — are all big names, led by the Wharton School at $172,016, NYU Stern ($168,291), Stanford ($168,226), Dartmouth College’s Tuck School of Business ($166,251), and the University of Virginia’s Darden School of Business ($165,292). In all, 12 schools in the top 25 of U.S. News’s MBA ranking report starting salaries above $160,000, and 17 above $150,000. “If you stayed at work in 2021, your career options and earning potential in 2023 would be more limited if you had gone to business school,” noted Soojin Kwon, managing director of full-time MBA admissions and program at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business. Why? Kwon notes that students will gain three advantages by going back to school that they won’t get by staying in a job during the pandemic. “One, you’ll meet with and learn from hundreds of smart, ambitious and interesting people you wouldn’t have met if you didn’t go to business school,” Kwon said at a recent panel discussion for Poets & Quants.  “Two, you’re going to learn how to network and interview for jobs in an industry or function that you’re interested in going into, and most, if not all MBA recruiters this year are planning to do virtual recruiting. So you’re going to learn how to interview in the format in which recruiters are going to be recruiting. In addition, she said, “You’re going to gain access to a network of tens of thousands of business school alumni and hundreds of thousands of alumni in the broader university community. You could absolutely find another job through LinkedIn, but it’s no secret that you’re more likely to get a response if you have some kind of connection, and an MBA from a top school with the support of alumni provides that invaluable connection for life.” During the Great Recession of 2008-2009, the job situation was just as miserable and prospects for many MBAs appeared so dim that some openly questioned their decision to borrow money to get the degree. Robert Bruner, then dean of the University of Virginia’s Darden School of Business, found himself having to defend the value of the MBA. He rose to the challenge, and his points then made much sense now. Education adds significant value to human potential. “Generally, research finds real rates of return on investment upwards of 10% and as high as 50%. And there is a correlation between years in school and earning power but that’s only the quantitative part. Every year, students graduate who are more self-confident, better communicators, and more promising leaders than when they enrolled. And they have joined an alumni network that has helped in good times and bad.” Indeed, long-term thinking beats short-term thinking all the time. Young professionals have a long career ahead of them. “With the benefits of modern medicine, you can probably look forward to a career of 50 years,” Bruner wrote. “Are you judging the worth of an MBA by only the first job you get out of B-school? Take the long view. If you could discount the marginal benefits of an MBA from a competitive school over the next 50 years, I’d guess that they well exceed the costs. Don’t discount the future too steeply.” Truth is, you can bet with certainty that tough times will again appear once this pandemic is under control and the economy recovers. The ability to assess and bear sensible risks is the core of business and entrepreneurship. Pursuing a graduate degree in business to learn valuable skills, cultivate one’s leadership potential, and acquire a supportive network of connected professionals is a risk worth taking. John A.

A stock split is a financial ‘non-event,’ but it can still play on investors’ emotions, experts say. Copyright © 2020 MarketWatch, Inc. All rights reserved."

    "text": "My husband and I have been married for almost eight years. Prior to marriage we had a prenuptial agreement made, where his RV and truck remained his to do whatever with, as my home and car remained mine. His RV is his pride and joy, and his “man cave” on wheels. I recently learned that his RV is “upside down.” He owes $75,000 more on it than it’s worth. My concern is that if something happens to him, I will end up with a lien on my home. My name is not on the RV, nor is his name on my home. Your help and thoughts are very much appreciated. Thank you. That was a clear prenuptial agreement. What’s yours is yours and what’s his is his, and anything you earn during your marriage is, I presume, shared. More or less. It sounds like you want to commingle your lives, but not your finances. Boys love their toys and he clearly takes great pride in his man cave on wheels, and it was and is important to him that it’s his, and his alone. That’s good news for you: You are not liable for this debt, if his name alone is on the loan. In community-property states — Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin — debt incurred during a marriage is deemed “community” responsibility. That is, both spouses are liable for that debt. In Alaska, newlyweds can choose to opt into community property rules. In other common-law states, spouses can incur debt on credit cards and RV loans during their marriage, and they are solely responsible for them. The Moneyist: My mother’s will says her boyfriend can live in her home after she dies. Can I still kick him out if the deed is transferred to me? There is one major exception to these rules, according to the American Bankruptcy Institute. You are liable for medical debts of your spouse under a legal theory called the Doctrine of Necessities. “The necessities rule is not limited to medical bills. It could apply to utilities, rent, food, clothing and any other necessities, but the most common lawsuit utilizing this legal concept is in the collection of medical debts,” it says. (At least two states, Virginia and Alabama, challenged this.) “In Nebraska, when you marry someone you also marry their future medical debts. If your spouse incurs medical debts during the marriage, you are liable for the debt. Even if the bills only come in the name of your spouse. Even if you did not sign for the debts. Even if you did not authorize the treatment. Even if you are separated. In Nebraska, when you marry someone you also marry their future medical debts. This doctrine has been accepted in Nebraska courts,” the institute adds. The Moneyist:My husband and I are worth $3.7 million, but I’m afraid I’ll spend my way into the poor house if he dies. When I was single, I bounced checks. What can I do? This does not, however, account for the indirect costs of a spouse incurring debts. You started your marriage with your eyes open, so you should continue in that spirit. Organize a monthly budget so you know where your red lines are on spending, and how much you need to earn to keep the books balanced, and put money aside for an emergency fund. You may also want to see if your husband can cut back on his spending to pay off his RV debt sooner rather than later. You’re a team. Worst-case scenario: If your husband cannot pay off the debt owed on his RV, it would obviously be repossessed by the company. If you or he lost his job, on the other hand, presumably the other spouse would shoulder the burden and help the other out. If he asks you to help out with the payments on his RV? That’s another question entirely. Hopefully, that won’t happen, Mary Ellen, and you and your husband will have a long and happy life together, and a few memorable trips in his RV.

    "text": "Shares of Tesla Inc. were knocked lower Tuesday, as the electric vehicle manufacturer took advantage of the stock’s best monthly performance in seven years to raise more capital. Tesla disclosed in an 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission before Tuesday’s opening bell that it entered into an “equity distribution agreement” with a host of Wall Street firms to raise up to $5 billion by selling shares from time to time, through an “at-the-market” program. Based on Monday’s stock closing price of $498.32, that amount represented about 10.03 million shares, or about 1.1% of the shares outstanding. Trading volume was 89.1 million shares, compared with a full-day average of about 74.5 million and enough to make it the second-most active stock listed on the Nasdaq exchange, according to FactSet. The share offering comes after Tesla’s stock soared 12.6% on Monday after a 5-for-1 stock split took effect, extending the stock’s 74.2% rocket ride in August. That was the stock’s best monthly performance since it soared 81.1% in May 2013, and the second-best monthly performance since Tesla went public in June 2010. Don’t miss: Tesla stock rally accelerates further into record territory after split takes effect. The rally has lifted Tesla’s market capitalization to $464.3 billion as of Monday’s closing price, making Tesla the seventh most valuable U.S. company. It has also made Chief Executive Elon Musk, Tesla’s largest shareholder about 34.1 million shares, the third richest person in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The sales agents in the equity distribution agreement were Goldman Sachs & Co., BofA Securities, Barclays Capital, Citigroup Global Markets, Deutsche Bank Securities, Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse Securities (USA), SG Americas Securities, Wells Fargo Securities and BNP Paribas Securities. The sales agents will receive a commission of up to 0.5% of the proceeds from each sale of shares. The agreement can terminate the distribution agreement at any time, for any reason. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives was upbeat about Tesla’s stock offering, but kept his rating on the stock at neutral and his stock price target at $380, which was about 24% below Monday’s closing price. Meanwhile, Ives’s “bull case” target of $700 suggests a further 40% gain was possible. “We believe this is the smart move at the right time for Musk & Co. after the parabolic rally in shares with the appetite strong among investors to play the transformational EV trend through pure play Tesla over the coming years,” Ives wrote in a note to clients. Ives has been neutral on Tesla since April 2019. Shares of Tesla Inc.  took a hit in premarket trading, but were still up 1.9%, after the electric vehicle maker disclosed a deal to sell up to $5 billion worth of its stock in an \"at-the-market\" offering program. Just before the offering was disclosed, the stock was up as much as 7.9%.  At Monday's closing price of $498.32, the program could represent up to 10 million shares, or about 1.1% of the shares outstanding. The \"equity distribution agreement\" was made with a host of Wall Street firms as sales agents, including Goldman Sachs, BofA Securities, Barclays, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank Securities, Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse, SG Americas, Wells Fargo and BNP Paribas. The sales agents will receive a commission of up to 0.5% of the proceeds. The stock has rocketed nearly fivefold (up 495.6%) year to date through Monday, while the S&P 500  has gained 8.3%.

    "text": "Raising children is expensive, but that hasn’t stopped Nic and Court from keeping their annual expenses below $25,000, even with a 2-year-old daughter. It helps that the two are masters at the FIRE movement, short for “Financial Independence, Retire Early.” The Calgary, Alberta, couple officially became financially independent two years ago, when their daughter was born. Nic no longer works, and Court works part-time. Even still, they save half of her salary. They live well below their means. The couple, who blog at Modern FImily, have $890,000 put away for their future, including five years’ worth of expenses in cash, and spend less than $25,000 a year. “What we are able to do now in our 30s with a child, a lot of it stems from setting us up to be in this position when we were in our 20s,” Court said. Back then, they did it so that they could pay down debts such as student loans and a mortgage while also traveling, but the financial habits they developed a decade ahead made it easier to raise a child while being financially conscious. “We never really let lifestyle creep impact us.” They don’t have cable, so they’re not influenced by advertisements, Court said. Health care is much more affordable in Canada than it is in the U.S., which naturally helps them keep their annual costs down. They’ve bought used, reliable cars so there aren’t costly repairs or monthly car payments. Much of their entertainment involves free or low-cost activities, such as ice skating on the local frozen ponds and tobogganing on hills in the winter, and walking around the neighborhood and by the creek during the summer. The only store their daughter ever sees them go to on a consistent basis is the supermarket. They cook a lot of their own meals. “We are spending all of our time with her and show her we love her that way rather than feel the need to compensate by buying toys,” Court said. Of course, they do still buy clothes and toys for their daughter, Finn, but much of those purchases are secondhand or hand-me-downs. The car seat for their daughter was new, but otherwise they often rely on online community groups to find families who want to get rid of stuff their babies never or barely used. “There might be a stigma toward hand-me-downs and secondhand, but they’re using these items for maybe a couple of months, so they’re likely in good shape,” Court said. They buy bins of clothes, sometimes with 50 different items, for around $20. Finn has a toy box that’s filled with all of her toys, and every week her parents switch out what comes out of the box, that way she can use her imagination and get creative about how they all work together. Some days, it will be toy trucks and a stroller, other days a doll. They rotate books by using the local library, as well as the little free community libraries near them (where neighbors place books in a box and pick out others to take home). They are considering welcoming a second baby into their family, and have already run the numbers for that. Nic and Court save $2,500 a year per child for college expenses, as well as have extra money set aside in their budget to account for an additional child — money that will go toward clothes, extra food, activities and so on. They’ll also have some of Finn’s old clothes and items, like a high chair and stroller, that a sibling can use. In the meantime, they will focus on teaching their daughter about money in an open way. Although Finn is only 2, they’ve already started to teach her the meaning of money. They collect and recycle their bottles for 5 cents apiece, bring her to the bottle depot and have her receive the money so that it can go in the piggy bank (except for the occasional trip for ice cream). The pair also has Finn help around the house so that she can observe them working to repair their stuff. When they were caulking the bathroom, they had their daughter sit with them and pretend to caulk (with a sealed container). When she gets older, they’ll encourage her to work, such as mowing lawns or getting a job at a coffee shop. “You learn so much from your parents and your surroundings by absorbing day-to-day life,” Court said.

    "title": "Here’s what could trigger more stock market pullbacks this year, says Schwab trading pro",
    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-what-could-trigger-more-stock-market-pullbacks-this-year-says-schwab-trading-expert-2020-09-01?mod=home-page",
    "text": "A record-setting August for stocks has set the bar high,but September may be off to an upbeat start, led by technology. That brings us to our call of the day from Schwab Center for Financial Research’s vice president of trading and derivatives, Randy Frederick, who thinks the stock market may finally deliver on some much-needed corrections. “We haven’t had anything of that nature at all since going all the way back to early June, when we had that big drop-off. We’re clearly way overdue on that,” Frederick said. And while 3,700 sounds “pretty remarkable from a bottom-of-the-virus return,” on a year-to-date basis that 14% gain for the S&P 500 is fairly average, he noted. When those smallish pullbacks come along, though, he advises against panic (he urged no panic in early March too), saying “they will be and should be used as buying opportunities.” That is  because there is nowhere else for investors to put their money as any Federal Reserve interest rate increase is years out, said Frederick. And investors should learn from those who panicked out of the market in 2008 and missed out on an 11-year bull market, he added. One potential correction trigger is technical, as he says 2020 has been closely tracking the action in 2009. That year saw three pullbacks — 3.5%, 4.3% and 5.6% in the last few months of 2009 — as his chart shows: A “substantial pullback in earnings could also trigger a pullback,” he said, noting that second-quarter S&P 500 earnings per share came in far better than expected.

    "text": "But it’s a new month and autumn and winter are coming, with a U.S. election race starting to heat up and the COVID-19 battle and all that comes with it. That brings us to our call of the day, from BTIG’s chief equity and derivatives strategist Julian Emanuel, who says an extremely strong August for stocks — the S&P 500 is up 7.2% through Aug. 28 — could be telling us something about who wins the White House in November. “At first glance, August strength plays well into Donald Trump’s re-election — in the three months prior to November elections, positive S&P 500 returns have accompanied incumbent party presidential victories 85.7% of the time,” Emanuel tells clients in a note. But going back to 1928, when stocks rose 5% or more in August, and the June to August return was top 25%, the market often struggled in September and October. “And when the S&P 500 is down from the end of August through the Election, the incumbent party has lost the White House on all six occasions,” he notes. Raising the stakes further, is notes political, social, public health and economic uncertainty against ”a Nasdaq-100 arguably in the midst of a potentially a “blowoff” top move” — a fast and high climb followed by a sharp drop. But he says it is hard to tell if we’re at the start, middle or end of that. Goldman Sachs says year-to-date, 43% of female-managed funds have outperformed their benchmarks versus just 41% of those with no female managers. A team led by Goldman’s chief U.S. equity strategist David Kostin explains: “Men may be from Mars and women from Venus, but female-managed funds tilt toward info tech while non-female managed funds prefer financials.” A chilling moment in history remembered as Berlin protesters tried to storm the Reichstag.

    "text": "Major U.S. stock indexes closed higher Tuesday, ending near or above prior all-time records, as upbeat economic reports and dovish tones from the Fed helped feed the buying momentum on Wall Street. The ascent for stocks comes despite expectations for  a seasonally challenging month for equities, following the best August returns in more than 30 years. On Monday, the Dow shed 223.82 points, or 0.8%, to end at 28,430.05. The S&P 500 fell 7.70 points, or 0.2%, ending at 3,500.31. The Nasdaq rose 79.82 points, 0.7%, to end at a record 11,775.46, its 41st record close of 2020. The S&P 500 clinched its best August return since 1986 and the Dow its best return for that month since 1984, while the Nasdaq recorded its strongest August since 2000. The winners of the past few months are looking to lead the next one, as September kicks off with further buying of large-capitalization growth and technology stocks, a major trading theme since March when the coronavirus pandemic took hold. “I prefer to call them stay-at-home stocks, because really they are the COVID winners,” said Stephen Dover, head of equities at Franklin Templeton, in an interview with MarketWatch. “Those are all beating the reopening stocks, including the airlines,” he said, pointing to the recent decision by major carriers to drop their fees on most tickets changes for domestic flights. “In essence, they can take that straight off their bottom line,” Dover said. U.S. stocks initially got off to a choppy start Tuesday, but gained steam throughout the session, including after Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard said the central bank should “pivot” to provide more support for U.S. economic growth, presumably meaning the Fed could purchase more assets, such as U.S. Treasurys or privately issued debt. RelatedU.S. corporate debt soars to record $10.5 trillion The jolt higher comes against a backdrop of elevated stock valuations, worries about a potential pullback in risk asset prices, but also with the Fed implying it will keep interest rates ultra-low, even if inflation pressures begin to percolate. Lindsey Bell, chief investment strategist at Ally Invest, called the Fed’s ongoing stimulus “a key backstop going forward,” particularly as communities and local governments work to gain more confidence around how to operate safely “in this new normal.” “I think the stay-at-home trade is still intact,” Bell told MarketWatch. But she also views plans by schools to at least partially reopen for in-person lessons, as well as areas of the economy hard-hit by the pandemic coming back to life, as positive signs for reopening stocks. In a last-minute decision on Tuesday, New York City opted to delay in-person classes at public schools until September 21, with remote learning also delayed until mid-month, amid a threat of a teacher strike. Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, said Tuesday that Senate Republicans are aiming to unveil a new, targeted coronavirus aid bill next week once lawmakers return from a break, echoing comments from Sen. John Barrasso, a Wyoming Republican who also said the focus is on “getting people back to work, getting kids back to school.” In economic data, American manufacturers for August showed a fourth straight monthly rise. The Institute for Supply Management said its manufacturing index rose to 56% in August from 54.2% in July. Readings over 50% indicate growth. Economists surveyed by MarketWatch had forecast the index to total 54.9%. The report followed a comparable reading from IHS Markit, which showed that manufacturing purchasing managers’ index rose to 53.1 in a final reading for August, down slightly from the previously released ‘flash’ estimate of 53.6, but up from 50.9 at the start of the third quarter to post the fastest expansion since January 2019.” Internationally, the overnight eurozone IHS manufacturing purchasing managers index pointed to improving conditions in August, as the region’s recovery from the coronavirus pandemic continued, while in China the Caixin purchasing managers index, which is weighted toward small, private manufacturers, rose to 53.1 in August from 52.8 in July. With much of the market recovering from its March lows, it is no wonder that investors are looking for opportunities in beaten-up sectors. And bank stocks certainly fit the bill.

    "text": "Stock indexes drifted higher on Tuesday to close near their best levels of the day and kick off what some anticipate will be a volatile September. It follows the best August for stocks in decades. Oil gained with the price of West Texas Intermediate crude settling up 0.4% and Brent crude advancing 0.7%. The price of gold gave up a larger rise to tick up less than 0.1%, to $1,968.20 an ounce, as the U.S. Dollar index rose 0.2% from a two-year low. Recent global economic data releases have generally supported the thesis of a continued rebound in activity as coronavirus-related restrictions are eased. On Tuesday, the August U.S. Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index from the Institute for Supply Management  added the latest supporting data point. The index came in at 56, up 1.8 points from July and ahead of the 54.5 consensus estimate. It’s the third month in a row indicating expanding manufacturing activity, following three months of contraction that began in March. Some investors were watching recently rising coronavirus cases in several European countries as a possible risk to that momentum. “Ultimately, how the world handles outbreaks of COVID is the most important factor for economic reopenings,” wrote Evercore ISI strategist Dennis DeBusschere on Tuesday. “Although case growth is slowly accelerating throughout much of Europe, YYG estimates of the rate of reproduction (one of the most accurate death models according to the CDC) remain below 1, indicating contraction in almost all countries in the EU. The vast majority of countries globally have Rt estimates below 1 and we continue to believe human ingenuity–in the form of treatments and vaccines–will allow for further progress.” Individual stock swings on Tuesday included big moves in several so-called “story stocks.” Write to Steve Goldstein at sgoldstein@marketwatch.com and Carleton English at carleton.english@dowjones.com Biden condemns rioting, Massachusetts votes in closely watched Democratic primaries, Trump official reportedly wants the U.S. to adopt “herd immunity,” and other news to start your day.

    "text": "U.S. Treasury yields fell Tuesday after investors took advantage of cheaper bond prices, following a brief selloff sparked by stronger-than-expected data on U.S. factory activity. Yields briefly climbed after an August reading from the Institute for Supply Management’s index of U.S. manufacturing came in at a 21-month high of 56, much higher than the consensus forecast of 54.7 from MarketWatch-polled analysts. Any number above 50 represents an increase in industrial activity. But that early selloff swiftly gave way to a rally in long-dated Treasurys as investors took the opportunity to snap up the cheapened bonds. Investors are also eyeing the steady rise in inflation expectations embedded in Treasury inflation-protected securities after the Federal Reserve’s policy review resulted in the central bank moving to an average inflation target of 2%, allowing price levels to overshoot to make up for periods when inflation fell short. Fed Gov. Lael Brainard said a more aggressive approach from the central bank would be needed to help Americans get back to work. Brainard also said the new policy of average inflation targeting would help support an economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. “The manufacturing sector remains relatively robust in spite of the ongoing uncertainty. Prolonged slippage in sentiment could weigh on household spending growth in the coming months, but for now, pent-up demand should be more than enough to push manufacturers to continue to rapidly ramp back up,” said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors. It has been a pretty bullish August for the stock market. That tends to work well in an incumbent U.S. President’s favor, but our call of the day says a twist could lie ahead.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/natural-gas-posts-biggest-monthly-gain-in-more-than-a-decade-51598990403?mod=home-page",
    "text": "Natural-gas futures rallied in August, tacking on nearly 50% to tally their largest monthly percentage gain in more than a decade as strong demand for the fuel in power generation significantly cut U.S. supplies in storage. In March, U.S. inventories of natural gas were 81% higher than the same a time year ago, but supplies recently stood at 20% above the year ago level, according to Peter McNally, global sector lead for industrial materials and energy at investment research firm Third Bridge. The “need for backup power and peaking power demand” increased in the short term, amid blackouts in California, lifting usage of natural gas, he says. On Aug. 31, October natural-gas futures settled at $2.63 per million British thermal units, with front-month prices climbing by roughly 46% for the month to date. They posted the largest one-month percentage rise since September 2009, when prices rose 62.6%, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Prices saw a big increase at the beginning of August, buoyed by “strong demand from natural gas-fired power generation,” according to a monthly report from the Energy Information Administration released on Aug. 11. The EIA estimates that natural gas consumption for power generation rose to 43.6 billion cubic feet per day in July 2020, “higher than any month on record.” Still, a decline in industrial natural-gas consumption, which fell by 1.4 billion cubic feet per day in July from a year earlier, likely due to slower economic activity, partially offset strength in consumption from electric power, the EIA said. Natural-gas production has fallen as producers have cut back on drilling and completion activities as a result of lower oil and natural-gas prices, according to the EIA, which estimates that output declined to 86.8 billion cubic feet per day in July, down 9.5 billion from the peak in November of 2019. That, combined with the rise in power generation demand, contributed to lower-than-average U.S. supply increases in July, it said. Even so, for the week ending Aug. 21, natural-gas inventories stood around 20% above the year ago level. The market will be looking to natural-gas output that’s associated with oil production, says McNally. “Additional supplies of natural gas have emerged from the Permian Basin that produces natural gas associated with targeted oil production,” he says. “That associated gas supply has come off with oil production in recent months, but it is something we will be watching going ahead.” Meanwhile, Hurricane Laura, which made landfall in Louisiana in late August, also contributed to the climb in natural-gas prices, says Marshall Steeves, energy markets analyst IHS Markit, with the resulting production decline expected to be met with a similar fall in demand due to power losses. Prices for natural gas have climbed by nearly 80% from the year-to-date low in late June of around $1.48 Btus. However, the natural-gas supply surplus “remains formidable with the summer cooling season drawing to a close in September,” which is a transitional month, says Steeves. The natural-gas price rally may be “short-lived, absent another heat wave or supply disruption,” he says. Wall Street has another explanation for why the stock market has been on fire, which could also help investors understand some tech stocks’ red hot winning streaks lately.

    "text": "After the best August returns for U.S. stock benchmarks in decades, investors are angst-ridden over the possibility that the bullish party in equities could come to a screeching halt. What’s an investor to do? Against that backdrop, analysts at UBS, led by Mark Haefele, recommended a trio of strategies that they said could help to mitigate downside risk. But before enumerating Haefel & Co.’s suggestions, the UBS folks said that remaining on the sidelines wasn’t an option, in an environment like this one in which the Federal Reserve has declared a lasting low-interest rate environment and injected historic amounts of liquidity into the financial system. The UBS team says it understands “that investors may be wary of committing capital to markets given the uncertainty surrounding COVID-19 and valuations becoming more expensive”…but notes that “drawbacks” to staying on the sidelines remain plentiful. “Stocks remain supported by Fed liquidity,” the analysts argued but noted that returns in that environment can still be quite positive. “Research shows that entering the market all at once has historically offered the best outcomes—even at record highs, where subsequent 12-month returns have averaged 12% since 1960.” What it is: Dollar-cost averaging is buying into an asset with a fixed dollar amount at fixed time intervals. It won’t protect you against losses completely but it could minimize the impact or may reduce the risk of buying a high-price stock. UBS recommends “establishing a set schedule—generally within 12 months or less—to reduce the cost of missing out on gains. In addition, we recommend accelerating each phase-in tranche if there is a market dip of at least 5% or 10%.” What it is: A put option is a derivative that gives its holder the right but not the obligation to sell a set number of underlying shares at a set price, called the strike price, before a certain time. Puts can be used to express bearish opinions of an asset. They can also serve as a hedge, or insurance, against turbulence. UBS recommends being a put seller, collecting a premium from the buyer, as one would by selling an insurance contract. “In doing so, the put-writer receives a premium, which during times of volatility can be relatively high. If the stock price falls below the agreed-upon price, the seller in addition to the premium takes delivery of the stock, which is a particularly attractive strategy if they were willing to increase equity exposure anyway,” the strategists write. What it is: Structured investments are investments that combine the feature of a fixed-income security and an option like a put, for example. They can be less liquid than bonds or stocks, however, and complex. The benefit of such bank-issued products is that they can be customized for a given investor but it can be somewhat risky depending on the issuer of the obligation. It has been a pretty bullish August for the stock market. That tends to work well in an incumbent U.S. President’s favor, but our call of the day says a twist could lie ahead.

    "text": "Any investor in the painful position of being caught on the short side of the Tesla juggernaut would certainly be forgiven for keeping a low profile, considering the stock’s incredible run. But Stanphyl Capital’s Mark Spiegel, in a recent letter to investors highlighted on the ValueWalk blog, reiterated the anti-Tesla thesis that he’s been spouting for years, while acknowledging the carnage that his short position has caused to his broader portfolio. “Year-to-date, Tesla (the biggest bubble in modern stock market history) is up an astounding 495%… and that hurt us significantly,” he wrote. “So our short positions have obliterated the profits from our long positions, and yet when this bubble pops we’ll be glad we have them.” From there, he touched on the bullet points as to why he believes he will ultimately profit from Tesla’s demise, including the lack of a moat and a return to red ink once emission credit sales expire.  He also tore into CEO Elon Musk, who he’s been consistently been painting as a fraud. “Superior competition” will also be a huge factor going forward, Spiegel explained,  with growing electric lineups from Audi, BMW, Mercedes, Volvo and Volkswagen, to name just a few.

Simple as that.” “Tesla, the minuscule automaker with a global market share of less than 1%, isn’t actually an automaker with stagnant revenues in a long-term stagnant or declining industry, but a data company with a secret government contract to populate Mars or whatever,” Richter wrote, with more than a hint of sarcasm. “You just have to put your brain on Tesla Autopilot and believe.” The big tech winners since the March low will be replaced by stocks in other sectors, says Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.

This is now obviously a recurring problem that should have you concerned if you lack access to professional trading platforms that don’t have similar problems. That includes a lot of us. I’ll get to several useful workarounds below. But first, here’s what we know about what’s going on, and why this is a huge issue for investors. The trite pushback goes like this: If you’re a long-term investor, losing market access for half a day shouldn’t matter. And shame on you for being a grubby trader who can’t live without constant access! This response falls short. Long-term investors such as Warren Buffett patiently lie in wait with cash for months or years for that one moment when their favorite stocks go on sale because of fears they deem unjustified. If accounts shut down exactly when that moment arrives, you can’t follow through. Investors weren’t the only ones hurt. The Monday mishap came at an inopportune time — the end of the month. Anyone wanting to check direct deposits or cash levels at Vanguard and elsewhere to pay bills couldn’t do so. 1. If something as innocuous as a stock split shuts down brokerage platforms, we can guess that it will happen again during the next market hiccup, and especially in any major crisis caused by something like a terrorist attack or natural disaster. 2. Professional trading platforms went unaffected. “I didn’t hear anyone saying they had a problem with order management systems,” says Joe Saluzzi of Themis Trading, referring to professional platforms. “The only thing I heard about was problems on retail systems.” It was a Main Street, not a Wall Street, problem. This turned Robinhood’s trademark catch phrase — “We’re on a mission to democratize finance for all” — on its head. 3. The brokerages aren’t telling us much about what went wrong, or how they plan to fix it. I reached out to the five brokerage services listed above, but got vague responses. (See below.) Saluzzi offers a plausible explanation. Partly because commissions are now zero, the number of trades in Apple and Tesla on Monday increased 3.5 to 5 times over Friday. This included tens of thousands of one- and two-share lots. “I’ve never seen stocks trade like that,” says Saluzzi, who has worked at brokerages and trading platforms for decades. His custom app that tracks time and sales in Apple and Tesla was “spinning like a roulette wheel” all day. And it continued after-hours — also unusual. The upshot: Even if overall trading volume wasn’t high, brokerage platforms got overwhelmed by trades and market data flow, he says. This might have caused an overload in one part of their systems that shut everything down. 4. CEOs at companies that reveal pay because they are public got anywhere from $6 million last year at E*TRADE to $16 million at Schwab. Directors are pulling in $215,000 to $544,600 a year. Much of this is “performance pay.” Customers may question why they got so much for managing trading platforms that do not perform when needed. (As private companies, Vanguard and Robinhood don’t disclose pay.) Vanguard, in response, says it has “heavily reinvested in our business and technology infrastructure to continuously provide a better client experience via web, mobile or phone. We will continue to review our technology systems carefully to help prevent interruptions in the future.” Robinhood says that, since March, it has improved system capacity, and to keep up with growth its engineering team “has been working diligently to further strengthen our infrastructure, improve reliability and increase capacity. We are actively growing our engineering teams.” Schwab responds that through Monday its “client-facing systems were fully available close to 99.9% of the time for the quarter.” It says it is continuing to investigate the root cause of Monday’s failure. “We do not publicly disclose the specific steps we take to ensure security and reliability.” TD Ameritrade didn’t say anything about what caused the outage, but it did say its thinkorswim app worked all day. E*TRADE declined to comment. Outages at key moments may continue. Here are some workarounds. • Use apps. Schwab tells me its phone app worked Monday, and it successfully directed customers there for market access. Ameritrade’s Margaret Farrell says its thinkorswim desktop and mobile apps worked Monday. It makes sense to enable all your brokerage’s apps as a backup. • Have some of your money on several platforms since they might not all freeze up at once. But even platforms including Interactive Brokers that have a reputation for being robust can have issues. • Invest for the long term, and don’t trade. This reduces the impact. But not by 100%. Even long-term investors watch their favorite stocks for buyable dips, a big part of long-term investing. ­• If you trade, reduce overnight exposure. But this common trading tactic won’t help when a crisis freezes platforms during trading hours. • Invest in mutual funds. Leave the driving to the pros, so outages don’t matter. The problem is that so many mutual funds so consistently underperform, it’s not necessarily a good option. • Ask your representatives in Congress for help. They can pressure financial regulators to do something. Agencies include the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Unfortunately, we are in a multi-year “silly season” in the political world. So it might not pay to get your hopes up about help from politicians. That would be a shame. In the day-to-day market bustle, we tend to forget that the main role of the stock market is to channel savings to companies so they can invest and create jobs, new drugs and other innovations.

The stock surged 6.8% in premarket trading Tuesday, after soaring 12.6% on Monday. RBC Capital's Joseph Spak lifted is price target to $290, which implies a 42% drop from Monday's record close of $498.32, from $170, while maintaining the underperform rating he's had on the stock since January 2019. \"We recognize we underestimated a critical valuation point: seemingly insatiable investor demand for alternative/clean vehicles,\" Spak wrote in a note to clients. He said he also believes investors have willing to show more patience and look further out for companies like Tesla. \"That being said, we struggle to explain the run-up to the stock split which academically doesn't change the value of Tesla equity but could help fuel investor interest,\" Spak wrote. \"We still view Tesla as fundamentally overvalued and having to grow into its valuation.\" Of the 36 analysts surveyed by FactSet, just 19% are bullish, 31% are bearish, and 50% are neutral. Since Tesla announced the 5-for-1 stock split after the Aug. 11 close, the stock has soared 81.3% through Monday, while the S&P 500  has gained 5.0%. Myra P.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/tesla-takes-advantage-of-stocks-best-month-in-7-years-with-5-billion-offering-2020-09-01?mod=home-page",
    "text": "Shares of Tesla Inc. were knocked lower Tuesday, as the electric vehicle manufacturer took advantage of the stock’s best monthly performance in seven years to raise more capital. Tesla disclosed in an 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission before Tuesday’s opening bell that it entered into an “equity distribution agreement” with a host of Wall Street firms to raise up to $5 billion by selling shares from time to time, through an “at-the-market” program. Based on Monday’s stock closing price of $498.32, that amount represented about 10.03 million shares, or about 1.1% of the shares outstanding. Trading volume was 89.1 million shares, compared with a full-day average of about 74.5 million and enough to make it the second-most active stock listed on the Nasdaq exchange, according to FactSet. The share offering comes after Tesla’s stock soared 12.6% on Monday after a 5-for-1 stock split took effect, extending the stock’s 74.2% rocket ride in August. That was the stock’s best monthly performance since it soared 81.1% in May 2013, and the second-best monthly performance since Tesla went public in June 2010. Don’t miss: Tesla stock rally accelerates further into record territory after split takes effect. The rally has lifted Tesla’s market capitalization to $464.3 billion as of Monday’s closing price, making Tesla the seventh most valuable U.S. company. It has also made Chief Executive Elon Musk, Tesla’s largest shareholder about 34.1 million shares, the third richest person in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The sales agents in the equity distribution agreement were Goldman Sachs & Co., BofA Securities, Barclays Capital, Citigroup Global Markets, Deutsche Bank Securities, Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse Securities (USA), SG Americas Securities, Wells Fargo Securities and BNP Paribas Securities. The sales agents will receive a commission of up to 0.5% of the proceeds from each sale of shares. The agreement can terminate the distribution agreement at any time, for any reason. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives was upbeat about Tesla’s stock offering, but kept his rating on the stock at neutral and his stock price target at $380, which was about 24% below Monday’s closing price. Meanwhile, Ives’s “bull case” target of $700 suggests a further 40% gain was possible. “We believe this is the smart move at the right time for Musk & Co. after the parabolic rally in shares with the appetite strong among investors to play the transformational EV trend through pure play Tesla over the coming years,” Ives wrote in a note to clients. Ives has been neutral on Tesla since April 2019. These tech companies have yet to report financial results for the quarter but have demonstrated they are benefiting from the pandemic.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/i-went-to-the-met-and-heres-what-i-saw-2020-09-01?mod=home-page",
    "text": "For 5½ months, it was the largest art-storage locker on the planet. Well stocked but eerily still. Now that another small crack has opened in New York’s coronavirus shutdown and visitors are trickling back in, the Metropolitan Museum of Art is again doing the job it is here for, helping to shed fresh light on our current travails as only great art can. The two Kyles—Kyle Alderdice and Kyle Sherman, one a furloughed bookseller, the other an actor at a time of no theater, both of Harlem—were standing in the brightness of the Met’s Carroll and Milton Petrie European Sculpture Court. They were gazing somberly at “The Burghers of Calais,” Auguste Rodin’s haunting bronze depiction of another city under siege. “You know the story?” the first Kyle asked the second Kyle. It’s quite a tale and quite a relevant one. It goes back to the 14th century and the Hundred Years’ War, when Edward III claimed to be heir to the Kingdom of France. After a long and bloody assault, Edward’s army had managed to capture the northern French city of Calais. So eager was the English king to exact retribution for the citizens’ “obstinate defense,” he ordered they be killed en masse. The massacre was suspended only after six of Calais’s leading citizens agreed to present themselves to the angry king, “bareheaded and barefooted” with ropes around their necks, prepared to die so that others might live. Rodin’s massive sculpture depicts the forlorn men just as they are leaving for the king’s camp in 1347, carrying the keys to the city’s gates and citadel. Desperation. Patriotism. The tragedy of horrible choices. “The Burghers of Calais” evokes it all. And a city at the brink of who knows what. The Met closed abruptly on March 13, the same week that much of New York went dark. For more than a century, the museum had never been shuttered for more than three days at a time. And even now, no one can predict the city’s future as a world capital of commerce, culture and humanity, not until the pandemic is over and the raging virus is tamed. But we do have some potent infrastructure that will help to propel a glorious return, quite a bit of it up a large set of stairs at 1000 Fifth Ave. Just as the best art always tells a story, so do those who curate it and those who come to consume it. “Our message to New Yorkers is that we all endure many things living in the city,” said Kenneth Weine, the museum’s vice president of external affairs. “This has been a traumatic five-plus months for all of us. So, please, come enjoy this jewel.” Saturday was the public reopening, preceded by two members-only days. Advance reservations are required now, but they’re easy to get. Masks are mandatory. Temperatures are taken at the door. And the crowds are limited to 25% capacity. What all this seems to mean in practice is that, with so few tourists in the city, people who live here suddenly have the run of the joint. “We were always confident we could offer a safe experience,” Weine said. “Two million square feet. Hundreds of galleries. A trained security staff. And filled with New Yorkers who understand the importance of masks and social distancing.” It was really just a matter of Gov. Andrew Cuomo saying, “Go.” Other notable institutions newly reopened include the Museum of Modern Art, the American Folk Art Museum and the Museum of the City of New York. The Met’s cafes and restaurants are still closed under the state’s no-inside-eating restrictions, but the permanent galleries are open, and there are three new things to see: Jacob Lawrence’s “dynamic cubism,” much of it focused on African-American life. Mexican artist Héctor Zamora’s curving masonry block wall on the rooftop terrace. And a retrospective called Making the Met, 1870–2020, celebrating 150 years of the museum’s collection. “The actual anniversary was April 13, right at the pandemic’s height,” Weine said. “I was here on Thursday, and I’m back again,” Alderdice said. “It’s where I come alone whenever I need a lift.” But on Monday, he brought along his actor friend Kyle Sherman, who moved to the city from Missouri in 2015 and had never once set foot in the Metropolitan Museum. “Yes, it’s ridiculous,” he said. “I was even in a show that’s all about the Met.” He was Warren, he said, in Adam Gwon’s musical “Ordinary Days,” the cheerful, annoying one who sees beauty in simple things. Two key scenes are inside the museum, including one under a Claude Monet painting. There’s even a song called “Saturday at the Met.” In the finale, Warren and his friend Deb are back at the museum, where he explains to her that ordinary things, “simple, familiar and full of feeling,” can also be art. That’s when he delivers the show’s musical finale, “Beautiful.” “Really, I can’t believe I’ve never been here before,” Sherman said after the short Rodin briefing. This week, even the story behind the sculptor’s bleak “Burghers of Calais” ends on an encouraging note. Edward’s queen, Philippa of Hainault, begs him to spare the lives of the six Calaisians. Against his better judgment, he relents. Ellis Henican is an author based in New York City and a former newspaper columnist. Apple Inc. shares  are up 1.7% in premarket trading Tuesday after J.P. Morgan analyst Samik Chatterjee raised his price target to $150 from a split-adjusted $115. Chatterjee wrote that \"investors have widely acknowledged the rich valuation\" of Apple's stock after the company became the first in the U.S. to notch a $2 trillion valuation in late August, but he still sees room to run for the shares. \"While the $2 trillion market cap valuation in itself is a significant milestone, that Apple shares crossed it in a year with significant COVID-19 disruption testifies to the recurring nature of not only its services, but also its products, such that investors are now willing to pay a services-like premium on the entire earnings stream and a modest premium on account of expectations for further revenue/earnings upside,\" Chatterjee said in a note to clients. Also on Tuesday, Bloomberg reported that Apple has asked its suppliers to build at least 75 million 5G iPhones in the coming months, which is similar to what the company asked for during its prior launch, a signal that Apple is seeing stability in its business despite the COVID-19 crisis. Apple shares have gained 60% over the past three months as the Dow Jones Industrial Average  has increased 12%. Copyright © 2020 MarketWatch, Inc. All rights reserved."

    "title": "Should I still use the 60/40 investing rule for retirement?",
    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/should-i-still-use-the-6040-investing-rule-for-retirement-2020-07-24?mod=home-page",
    "text": "The 60/40 rule is a classic investing strategy, but whether it’s useful is up for debate. Not all financial advisers and investment professionals say it’s the best choice when saving for retirement. Vanguard Group defended the strategy in a recent note to its clients, saying the asset allocation allows investors and their portfolios to combat volatility — such as during the current global pandemic. The 60/40 rule dictates 60% of the portfolio is invested in stocks and 40% in bonds or other “safe” classes. Comparatively, some financial services firms, such as Bank of America BAC, have said the 60/40 rule is essentially dead. In a research note published last year called “The End of 60/40,” Bank of America portfolio strategists said “there are good reasons to reconsider the role of bonds in your portfolio.” Instead, investors should focus more of their attention on equities. Reconsidering the 60/40 construction can be a good idea for some investors. “It is a good core portfolio that has stood the test of time, but considering the current interest rate environment, the use of a much more highly diversified portfolio makes more sense to mitigate risk and create more consistent expected returns for investors,” said Thomas Rindahl, a financial adviser at Truwest Wealth Management Services. The investments within equities and bonds are also crucial to determining just how effective it is in protecting investors from steep declines while still growing. Bond exposure alone isn’t enough to hedge against major volatility, said Matthew McKay, an investment analyst at Briaud Financial Advisors. Treasury Bonds would be beneficial, but corporate bonds or asset-backed securities are typically included in selloffs in a panic. There’s also no inflation protection, or no holdings in commodities. The strategy is also generic, and doesn’t take into account personal needs and factors, including age, spending, amount already saved, and other expected retirement income, such as Social Security or pensions, said Larry Luxenberg, a principal at Lexington Avenue Capital Management. “Everyone should think about asset allocation but where they end up is an individual matter,” he said. Instead of restricting a portfolio to just two asset classes — stocks and bonds — investors should look at those as well as other asset classes. “I argue that investing based on age or expected retirement, while only considering two types of assets (stocks and bonds) is a bit thoughtless,” McKay said. The bucket approach may be better, which divides portfolios into “buckets” for various goals that are invested differently to achieve those aspirations, said Marguerita Cheng, chief executive officer of Blue Ocean Global Wealth. “Sixty-forty isn’t necessarily dead per se, but cookie cutter or template models may not work because not everyone’s situation is the same,” she said. Still, it’s a good starting point. The 60/40 rule is also known as the “Goldilocks Portfolio,” said Mackenzie Richards, a financial planner at SK Wealth Management. “Not too risky, but not overly safe,” he said. “Something that will allow a retiree to keep pace with the increasing cost of living.” During volatility, having the presence of bonds in a portfolio still prevents such steep declines from blows to equities, said Herschel Clanton, president of Chancellor Wealth Management. “The 60/40 portfolio still has value,” he said. Some experts may be saying the portfolio strategy is dead because the bull market is over, which weakens the 60% portion of the allocation, and interest rates are low, which hinders the steady income from the 40% side, Richards added. But that’s a nearsighted perspective, he said. “These market prophets tend to focus on the short-term situation, failing to think about the different market cycles that a retiree is going to experience over the rest of their lifetime,” he said. “With these cycles, as we have seen over the past 100 years, there is going to be fluctuation in stock prices as well as interest rates.” Alessandra Malito is a retirement reporter based in New York.

    "text": "The thought must’ve crossed many investors’ minds during the pandemic. Why not just get out of the markets entirely and switch into cash? Fund management giant Vanguard Group looked at the investors who did exactly that, in a study recently published. Now, the Vanguard crowd isn’t exactly that of Robinhood—between Feb. 19 and May 31, only 5% of self-directed defined-contribution plan participants traded at all. The proportion was somewhat higher among retail self-directed households, with 17% making some trades during that time period. For both sets of investors, less than 0.5% of clients moved into all-cash portfolio, Vanguard said. The defined contribution cash panickers went from having 69% of their $105,000 portfolios in stocks at the end of 2019, and the retail cash panickers went from having 77% of their $70,000 portfolios in stocks. In both cases, these investors were typically in the mid-50s and held accounts for over a decade. About two-thirds of the defined contribution cash panickers were female; the retail cash panicker split was 46% male, 29% female and 25% a household of two or more members. Vanguard then went and compared the distributions of their actual realized returns to their personal pre-pandemic benchmark returns. At the end of March, the cash panickers had done better, with 56% of defined contribution and 58% of individual investors sporting better returns. That changed as the market rebounded. By the end of May, 84% of the defined contribution cash panickers had worse returns than their pre-pandemic portfolio, with 86% of retail cash panickers doing worse.

    "text": "Bad news, folks. Just when you thought it was safe to take this job and, you know, a major scientific commission is warning that early retirement can cause Alzheimer’s—or at least serious cognitive decline. Sorry, FIRE fans. This gloomy news appears in an otherwise upbeat major new report on dementia research, conducted by a blue-ribbon global scientific panel, and published in the renowned British medical journal The Lancet. “[A] 12-year study of 1658 people found older retirement age but not number of years working was associated with lower dementia risk,” the Lancet Commission reports. “Another study found a twofold increase in episodic memory loss attributable to retirement…compared to non-retirees, adjusting for health, age, sex, and wealth.” Another cohort study of 3,433 people retiring at an average age of 61 found “verbal memory declined 38%. faster than before retirement.” Just for good measure, they added: “In countries with younger compared with higher retirement ages, average cognitive performance drops more.” Dementia is a much bigger issue than we typically acknowledge. It is destroying far more lives than COVID-19. There are an estimated 50 million people around the world with dementia, and that’s projected to triple over the next 30 years. There is no vaccine on the horizon. And the situation is getting worse. Most of those suffering from the disease are elderly. It is possibly the biggest single worry of those planning for retirement—not only because the disease is so bad but because it can last for years, taking a terrible toll on family, caregivers and family finances. The Lancet Commission consists of more than two dozen top medical scientists from around the world, from Britain to Israel to Australia. It has conducted a new systematic review of all the scientific research on Alzheimer’s and dementia published since its previous report in 2017. The bad news: Scientists still don’t know what causes Alzheimer’s, and are still struggling with medical treatments. The good news? Researchers have now found 12 different things which can drastically lower our risks. “These the 12 modifiable risk factors account for around 40% of world-wide dementias, which consequently could theoretically be prevented or delayed,” they report. Three of the 12 are newly identified, they say. The other nine, first identified in the 2017 report, have since been confirmed by further research, they add. Some of the 12 are things we can each control directly. Those who want to minimize their risks of getting dementia should avoid drinking too much alcohol, researchers say. They should avoid breathing in too much air pollution. They should stop smoking. As early as possible in life they should get their weight down to a healthy level, avoid obesity, take exercise, and lower their blood pressure. And when they start to lose their hearing, they should use a hearing aid. Apparently it really makes a difference. Oh, and finish high school: The more education you get before age 20, the less likely you are to end up with dementia. Other risk factors are more complex to control or avoid, such as avoiding traumatic brain injuries, depression and social isolation. (It’s courtesy of the Department of Irony and Unintended Consequences, by the way, that the COVID-19 lockdown is almost certainly causing spikes in most of these risk factors. People are more isolated, more depressed, they’re drinking more and eating more and exercising less.) Meanwhile, here’s a cheerful note. The Commission also reports that a big study of more than 15,000 people in China found that people over 65 who read, played games and gambled had reduced risk of getting dementia.

    "title": "When investors fear losing it all, skilled financial advisers bring them back to reality",
    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/when-investors-fear-losing-it-all-skilled-financial-advisers-bring-them-back-to-reality-2020-08-10?mod=home-page",
    "text": "With the U.S. economy grappling with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, investment advisers are seeing the ripple effects. Some clients fear losing everything they’ve built. For some, the threat of bankruptcy is a reality, while for others, even the remote possibility of going broke stirs feelings of dread. Advisers face a tricky challenge in aiding these anxious clients. On one hand, they have a responsibility to prepare individuals for the worst — and devise a plan if the money runs out. But in their effort to assist clients in desperate financial straits, they risk coming on too strong. Facing the likelihood of losing it all can prove immobilizing. Rushing to draft a detailed strategy and offer technical advice will backfire if a client isn’t ready to listen. First, an adviser needs to show concern and gather information. “Maybe the client is treading water with their anxiety,” said Meghaan Lurtz, a senior research associate at Kitces.com, which provides education and resources for financial planners. “Part of an adviser’s job is to be there while they tread” and serve as a sounding board. Advisers who set a supportive tone are better positioned to help clients grapple with their fear. Responding to anxiety with non-judgmental acceptance is a good first step. “It may be exhausting and stressful for advisers to deal with these clients,” Lurtz said. “But you still need to thank them for opening up to you. That makes them feel safe.” The next step is to try to learn more. To someone scared of losing their business, for example, say: “Tell me how things for you are going.” “Get to the heart of what the client is experiencing and what’s at the heart of their fear,” Lurtz said. “It may be they’re nervous about losing key employees to the virus or how long they can continue to pay them. Or it may be a decline in revenues and their P&L [profit and loss]. It may be about something else.” She urges advisers to make statements (“Tell me more about that”) rather than pose questions. That’s because clients are more apt to lower their guard and speak freely when responding to a neutrally worded prompt. “When we hear a question, our brain thinks there’s a right and wrong answer,” she said. “But people respond very differently to a statement. It cues the client that you really want to know, and solicits a richer type of response.” Advisers tend to draw conclusions from data analysis. If they think a client’s fear of losing it all is unfounded, they may trot out facts and figures as reassurance. Yet appealing to rationality when someone is not thinking clearly — and riddled with fear — carries risk. “Whether the fear is rational or irrational, it’s real in the client’s mind,” said Kim Bourne, a New York City-based certified financial planner. “So you have to get to the root cause, whatever is underlying that fear.” She cites the example of a client, a pre-retiree in his 60s, who feared a financial wipeout as the market tanked in mid-March. In reality, he held significant assets and faced no danger of bankruptcy. “He had the experience of poverty in his past, so he was afraid,” she said. “The fear of losing everything was lingering in his head.” Bourne dignified his fear. Instead of trying to appeal to his rational side by crunching the numbers, she sought to learn more about his feelings. “Tell me more about what it felt like when you didn’t have enough money,” she said. Then she asked, “What did you learn from those dark moments?” Then she asked: “How did that help you achieve your greatest financial accomplishments?” He came away with a restored sense of perspective, Bourne says, and his fear no longer plagues him as much. ‘Sweden’s prized herd immunity is nowhere in sight,’ according to an analysis in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine.

    "text": "If you are an investor of any type — whether you have a 401(k), IRA, or trading account — there are a few things you could do to promote racial equity. You may have heard of ESG investing, which stands for “environmental, social and governance.” It is also often called sustainable, socially responsible or simply “values” investing. It’s an investment strategy that selects stocks and bonds based not only on traditional financial criteria, but also based on the impact of different companies on society and the environment. Proponents of ESG investing point to a growing body of evidence that suggests sustainable investing may actually improve a portfolio’s performance, while also serving the greater good. Over the past five years, sustainable funds have outperformed their conventional peers in both up and down markets, according to a Morningstar report. Also, as markets tumbled during the first quarter of 2020, almost 60% of the biggest U.S. sustainable mutual funds and exchange-traded funds lost less in market value than the S&P 500. The popularity of socially responsible investing has exploded in recent years. In early 2020, around 74% of global investors said they plan to increase their ESG allocation over the next year. In the first quarter of 2020, U.S., sustainable funds saw inflows of $10.5 billion, according to Morningstar — a more than 10-fold increase from the first quarter of 2010. And even as markets tumbled due to the coronavirus crisis, global demand for ESG proved resilient. The global sustainable-fund universe saw inflows of over $45 billion in the first quarter, while the overall fund universe saw outflows of more than $380 billion, according to Morningstar. Environmental factors often include things like carbon emissions and water usage. Social impact may involve working conditions for a company’s employees and gender or racial equity. And governance criteria often have to do with board oversight and transparency. In light of recent events, the “S” — or social — part of ESG has come into focus, as more and more people are looking at the social impact of large corporations, specifically from a racial justice standpoint. That’s where things get a little tricky. There are more than 300 funds marketed as ESG in the U.S., according to Morningstar. But there’s no official definition of “socially responsible” investing. To further complicate the issue, there are dozens of different companies that issue ESG ratings, ranging from large data providers, like MSCI and Sustainalytics, to smaller companies and even nonprofits that focus on topics like gender-pay equity and civil liberties. Unlike accounting standards, there is not one unique methodology. Some of the data is self-reported by the companies, and some of it is done by third parties, who are often estimating. There are of course some broad principles, like how the company treats its workers — but these are often hard to quantify. For example, companies can get a high score for having anti-harassment policies in place, without tracking how well the policies are actually implemented. “There are not yet clear apple-to-apple comparisons across the board even for public companies, let alone private companies,” said Andrei Cherny, CEO of Aspiration, an online “financial firm with a conscience,” which offers a variety of banking and investing products focused on environmental and social impact. Cherny has called for regulators to require public companies to report ESG-related data, such as carbon emissions, diversity of their workforce, and how they pay their employees — just like they have legal obligations to report their financial performance. “Those are factors that investors need to know just as much as they need to know the price-to-earnings ratio,” he said. Other industry leaders echo Cherny’s thoughts. For instance, in the wake of recent events, Calvert Research & Management, a prominent sustainable-investing shop, called for companies to “accurately assess their racial diversity” and make it public, provide pay equity disclosure across race and gender, and publicly state what they are doing to combat racism and police brutality. Meanwhile, some asset managers have decided to influence change from the inside. Neuberger Berman, which manages $330 billion, decided to use its shareholder status to drive governance and sustainability practices. In April 2020, the company announced that it would publicly disclose and explain the firm’s voting rationale and intentions at more than 25 key annual shareholder meetings. “Normally shareholders vote quietly behind the scenes,” said Jonathan Bailey, Head of ESG at Neuberger Berman. Instead, by providing advance vote disclosure, Neuberger Berman intends to educate investors and the public on “why we’re voting a particular way,” Bailey said. “We have a responsibility, as market participants, to take [these issues] seriously; they’re financially material issues,” Bailey said. The proposal did not end up passing, as it gathered about 30% shareholder support, according to a Neuberger Berman spokesperson. While there are currently no industry-wide standards around social impact, a few companies have launched niche products specifically targeted at race and equality. For example, OpenInvest, a company that builds indexes and other investing tools around social causes, has created an index specifically on racial justice. It screens for metrics like board member inclusion, workforce diversity and which companies pollute the most in communities of color. Similarly, Impact Shares, a nonprofit provider of exchange-traded funds, partnered with the NAACP to launch a first-of-its-kind racial empowerment ETF. But what the ESG industry has been missing is that “your social priorities may be drastically different from my social priorities,” said Ethan Powell, CEO of Impact Shares. For example, some ESG funds hold shares of liquor or gaming companies. These holdings might be a problem for some investors, but not others. Powell envisions a future where “effectively every social issue will be reflected with a separately investible fund,” so that investors can create portfolios that are reflective of their individual social priorities. Partnering with nonprofits could play a key role in the development of such products, according to Powell, because social-advocacy organizations are in a better position to understand the particular social issues at hand. What many experts agree on is that growing investor demand will inevitably push the industry to innovate. Years ago socially-responsible investing offered just a few options to cover a small piece of investors’ stock portfolios. Today, there are hundreds of different mutual and exchange-traded funds to pick from, not just in equities but also in fixed income and even junk bonds. One study showed that around $12 trillion of assets in the U.S. are managed under some sustainable investing strategy. So while you wait for the industry to establish widely-accepted standards, you could start building your own socially-responsible portfolio by looking at the ratings and methodology of different funds and companies and picking what aligns best with your values and financial goals. The big tech winners since the March low will be replaced by stocks in other sectors, says Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/chinas-economy-may-be-back-on-track-but-problems-plague-it-elsewhere-11598997987?mod=home-page",
    "text": "It’s been no secret that China was among the first to emerge from the pandemic that is still ravaging much of the world — in part because it was the first to experience the crisis, but also because of its heavy-handed but effective lockdown. And compared with much of the world, China’s current conditions are exceptional, and it has been seen as the sort of sentinel in how to return, and how to gauge that return, to elements of normalcy. Schools are mostly back in session, the coronavirus is under control save for a few small pockets, and a steady stream of solid economic news has come in lately. China is likely to be the only country globally to see full-year 2020 economic growth. That being said, China’s National Bureau of Statistics reported on Monday that the manufacturing index fell, while the services reading rose a bit. The country has come an enormous way since January, when it locked down. Yet these measurements of normalcy are misleadingly narrow — they define “normal” in terms of select economic areas, low coronavirus numbers, and kids returning to school — all important metrics. But as China exerts its newfound superpower status, it finds itself grappling with the most challenges faced in years if not decades. Defined this way, things are far from normal. “In these days of the global pandemic, ‘normal’ is relative,” Karen Eggleston, director of Stanford University’s Asia health-policy program, told MarketWatch on Wednesday. Eggleston added: “China still faces numerous challenges, from handling the risks of reinfection, to making up for the foregone/delayed screening and care for non-COVID conditions, to quickly but carefully developing and testing vaccines and preparing for national deployment in an industry previously rocked by scandal, to trying to address the structural challenges underlying [the difficulty and expense of receiving medical care], and addressing disparities in lifecourse opportunities for healthy lives that leads to a more than 10-year differences in life expectancy across regions.” Thus, under the placid surface of China’s post-coronavirus return to life largely as it was, lies a slew of exceptions, setbacks and maneuverings that are both part of its escape from the pathogen’s grip as well as its ongoing rise as the world’s up-and-coming global power. China’s true unemployment rate may never be known given China’s opaque system — the latest reading by outside experts puts the number at 20% among recent graduates — the concentration-camp scandal and virus crisis in the Xinjiang region are roiling potentially millions of lives, border clashes with India and historically bad relations with the U.S. (aggravated by the pandemic) put it at loggerheads with two giant rivals, Beijing’s takeover of Hong Kong has upended many lives there, and the worst floods in decades are wreaking havoc across a quarter of the country. Last weekend, China implemented restrictive export rules for technology companies, which could complicate an order from the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump’s that ByteDance sell the American operations of its subsidiary TikTok by Sept. 15. The move mirrors the economic retaliations the countries have been lobbing since the trade war. Most observers are focused on the brighter day-to-day return to normal life. “From afar it looks a miserable year for all the reasons you cited, but relatively China appears to be doing better than many other countries that are still struggling with the pandemic,” said China expert  Bill Bishop, author of the Sinocism newsletter and a former MarketWatch executive. Susan Shirk, currently a professor at the School of Global Policy and Strategy at the University of California, San Diego, who previously served as deputy assistant secretary of state responsible for U.S. policy toward China, agreed, telling MarketWatch, “I believe that what people mean when they contrast China’s ‘return to normalcy’ to the situation in the U.S. and many other countries, is simply that people have returned to in-person work, school, shopping, dining, and even travel now that the virus has been controlled for the time being.  But of course, you are right that there are many features of pre-covid life that haven’t returned yet and the government is on high alert for any new outbreaks.” COVID didn’t cause all of China geopolitical and trade issues, its frayed relationships with more than a handful of countries. But it certainly exacerbated them. We might do well to rethink our definition of “return to normalcy.” Tanner Brown covers China for  MarketWatch and Barron’s.

    "text": "Wall Street is bracing for the possibility of inflation making an unlikely return next year. Expectations for heightened inflationary pressures  reflect the economic devastation wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic during the second-quarter of this year which resulted in several months of subdued inflation readings, but as these weaker months roll out of yearly inflation measures in the second half of next year, U.S. price levels could test and surpass the central bank’s target of 2%. The sharp hit to the U.S. economy this year would end up laying the foundation for higher inflation numbers, according to Guy LeBas, chief fixed income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott, in an interview. JP Morgan economists estimated there is a 70% chance of personal consumption expenditures exceeding 2%,  excluding volatile food and energy prices. But LeBas suggested investors shouldn’t get too carried away. “Right now, we’re in the greatest dis-inflationary impulse we’ve seen in a decade,” he said. And many economists see this kind of so-called base effect as more of a statistical quirk rather than a long-term, structural increase in inflation that some have warned against. Market-based measures of inflation risks have returned back to pre-pandemic levels, in part due to the Federal Reserve’s announcement last week that it would aim for an average inflation rate of 2%. If markets are right, it will give the Fed the opportunity to show how the central bank’s new average inflation targeting regime works. Under the  policy, the Fed would not respond  to temporary overshoots of the inflation target with interest rate hikes to make up for periods when price pressures were muted. “If inflation does rebound, the Fed needs to put their money where their mouth is,” Tom Graff, head of fixed income at Brown Advisory, told MarketWatch. It was important that when inflation did return to 2%, the Fed needed to push back against any expectations for it to promptly raise interest rates in a public manner to convince the market it would adhere to its new policy approach. “Otherwise, this will all be for naught,” said Graff.

    "text": "Senate Republicans are aiming to unveil a new “targeted” coronavirus aid bill next week once lawmakers return from a break, a  senior White House official and a Wyoming senator said Tuesday. “I expect them to pass a bill or at least put forth a bill in hopes of getting to that 60-vote threshold sometime  next week,” Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, said in a televised interview Tuesday.. His comments echoed those of Sen. John Barrasso, a Wyoming Republican who presided over a brief ceremonial session of the Senate earlier today. “We have a focused, targeted solution that we hope that the House would pass and the House would agree to. It’s focused on getting people back to work, getting kids back to school,” he told a reporter after the session. “That’s the goal, is to come back and vote to move to that,” Barrasso said. The Republican-led Senate returns Tuesday after its traditional summer break that began this year on Aug. 13. The Democratic-held House of Representatives comes back the week after, though some House committees will be in action next week to tee up bills for floor action later. Little has changed since both chambers saw their members leave for the summer break. The White House has taken executive actions it says will help keep the economy afloat after some provisions of the CARES Act lapsed, though there is disagreement over how timely and effective measures will be. In the meantime, both House Democrats and the White House have edged away from previous positions on the size of a package. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said Democrats would accept a $2.2 trillion deal, down from the $3.4 trillion price tag of the bill the House passed in May. Meadows has said the White House has offered a $1.3 trillion proposal, up from the $1.1 trillion. But what would be in those packages and how much would go where appeared to still be far from resolved. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, testifying before a House committee set up to oversee coronavirus relief efforts, said he thought a deal was still possible. “I believe a bipartisan agreement still should be reached and would provide substantial funds for schools, testing, vaccines, PPP for small businesses, continued enhanced unemployment benefits, child care, nutrition, agriculture, and the U.S. Postal Service, along with liability protection for universities, schools, and businesses,” he said in his opening statement to the panel. Mnuchin, only days before the next monthly jobs report is to be released, said the CARES Act passed in March had helped the economy mend and that it continued to rebound. “For the third month in a row, the jobs report exceeded forecasts, with a gain of 1.8 million jobs in July. This brings our three-month total gain to more than 9 million jobs, meaning that over 41 percent of jobs lost due to the pandemic have been recovered,” he said. Meadows said more unilateral actions by the White House were a possibility in lieu of a new deal, including potentially help for the airline industry, which is looking at layoffs. “We’re looking very closely at a number of executive actions,” he said.  “Whether we can actually do that to help the airlines or not still remains an open question.” Meadows said he met late yesterday with President Donald Trump on the issue of airlines aid specifically. Pelosi has said the White House has not taken the coronavirus seriously enough and has refused to pony up the money necessary to fight it. It’s also dismissed the science on the disease, she said Monday evening in an interview on MSNBC. “What further evidence does anyone need that this President didn’t care less about the spread of this virus than to see what he did, vandalizing, by the way, the White House by bringing all those people there, no masks, no distancing and the rest?” she asked. “He slapped science right in the face, and what a bad example that was.” Dr. Anthony Fauci, the federal government’s top infectious disease expert, says Labor Day weekend will be key in determining whether the U.S. gets a “running start” at containing the coronavirus this fall.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/brainard-says-fed-should-shift-to-more-aggressive-strategy-to-boost-the-economy-2020-09-01?mod=home-page",
    "text": "Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard on Tuesday said the central bank should “pivot” to providing more support for U.S. economic growth in the months ahead after introducing a flurry of unprecedented programs earlier in the year when the coronavirus epidemic broke out. Brainard suggested a more aggressive approach would be needed to help Americans get back to work, reduce a high unemployment rate, and nudge inflation closer to the central bank’s goal. With interest rates already at record lows, presumably the Fed would accomplish that goal through the purchase of more assets such as U.S. Treasurys or privately held bonds. The Fed has already ramped up asset purchases to stabilize financial markets and pull down long-term interest rates. The lowest mortgage rates in modern times have spurred a rapid increase in homes sales even as the coronavirus continues to depress large swaths of the economy. Auto sales have also boomed. Yet Brainard also cautioned  that low interest rates stemming from the Fed’s looser inflation-fighting strategy could entice investors to take more risks in search of returns and destabilize asset prices once the economy expands again. The Fed would need to be vigilant, she said, and use all its tools to prevent asset volatility from derailing a recovery. In remarks to the Brookings Institution, Brainard became the latest Fed official to argue vociferously in favor of the central bank’s historic shift to inflation averaging. The Fed broke with decades of tradition last week to adopt an inflation-averaging strategy that could result in interest rates staying low for longer periods. The bank would strive for an average 2% inflation rate over an undetermined period of time instead of a hard 2% target before raising rates. Senior Fed officials, including Chairman Jerome Powell and Vice Chairman Richard Clarida, have come out in force in the past week to argue on behalf of the change. Brainard said the new strategy will help support an economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic and boost hiring in the long run, especially for less-skilled Americans on the fringes of the labor market. Echoing comments from her colleagues, Brainard said the Fed may have erred by raising interest rates as much as it did from 2015 to 2018. The central bank lifted its benchmark fed funds short-term rate to as high as 2.5% from the near-zero level that long prevailed in the aftermath of the 2007-09 Great Recession. The cost of many business and consumer loans are tied to the fed-funds rate. Although millions of Americans still found jobs, Brainard suggested hiring “would have been greater” had the Fed’s new inflation-averaging strategy been in place several years ago. Brainard said the Fed’s old approach to measuring inflation and deciding when to raise interest rates had become less effective because of major changes in the U.S. and global economies that have swept in an era of low inflation. The Fed used to raise interest rates when the unemployment rate fell, but the longstanding relationship, known to economists as the Phillips curve, began to break down more than a decade ago. Even as unemployment fell to record lows, inflation barely rose. For most of the past decade inflation has persistently run below the Fed’s 2% target, raising the specter of an even more damaging bout of deflation. The last time the U.S. experienced a serious bout of deflation was in the early stages of the Great Depression almost a century earlier. The new strategy, Brainard said, could “arrest any downward drift in inflation expectations.” The number of deaths through July 2020 is 8% to 12% higher than it would have been if the coronavirus pandemic had never happened.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/three-of-the-most-buzzworthy-moments-from-that-trump-laura-ingraham-interview-2020-09-01?mod=home-page",
    "text": "This interview was a talker. President Donald Trump sat down with Fox News host Laura Ingraham in the White House on Monday night, and the hour-long Q&A took some unexpected turns that went viral on social media overnight. The president compared police shooting unarmed Black suspects, such as a Kenosha, Wis. officer shooting Jacob Blake in the back seven times last week, to a golfer choking under pressure. Trump agreed that firing seven bullets into Blake in front of his children was extreme. “I mean, couldn’t you have done something different? Couldn’t you have wrestled him?” he asked. Yet he outraged many viewers by adding, “But they choke, just like in a golf tournament, they miss a 3-foot putt.” Ingraham cut him off, anticipating the blowback to the sound bite. “You’re not comparing it to golf, because that’s what the media would say,” she said. The president’s response? “No, I’m saying people choke, and people are bad people,” he said. “[Police officers] can do 10,000 great acts, which is what they do, and one bad apple — or a choker, you know, a choker, they choke — shooting the guy in the back many times.” The president alleged that people in the “dark shadows” are controlling his Democratic rival Joe Biden. Ingraham asked Trump, “Who is pulling Biden’s strings?” He responded with, “People that you’ve never heard of, people that are in the dark shadows” are controlling his presidential opponent. “There are people that are on the streets, there are people that are controlling the streets,” he continued, but wouldn’t elaborate, because he said the situation is under investigation. “We had somebody get on a plane from a certain city this weekend. And in the plane, it was almost completely loaded with thugs, wearing these dark uniforms, black uniforms, with gear and this and that,” he continued. “A lot of the people were on the plane to do big damage.” MSNBC political analyst Howard Fineman called these claims “truly nuts.” And CNN’s Daniel Dale said the “dark shadows” accusation was “almost too stupid fact-check.” Biden’s campaign responded in a statement posted to Twitter early Tuesday morning that read: “The President of the United States is bizarrely highlighting the unrest and division he has stoked, refusing to condemn violence committed by his own supporters. Donald Trump’s incomprehensible case for doing even more damage in a second term makes less and less sense every single day.” The president said the suburbs are in danger from Biden — and Black Democratic Sen. Cory Booker — expanding low-income housing. Ingraham also asked Trump how he plans to win over women voters who might view him as too aggressive, which led him to segue into explaining how he plans to make women feel safe again by pushing for law and order. That includes keeping the suburbs “safe” by blocking the expansion of low-income housing there. “They were trying to destroy the suburbs,” he said of the Democrats. “They want low-income housing, and with that comes a lot of other problems, including crime.” Ingraham cut him off once again, interjecting with, “You’re not saying poor people are criminals though.” The president responded, “No, I’m not saying that at all, but there is a level of violence that you don’t see.” He pointed to how he recently rescinded the Obama-era Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing (AFFH) rule, which housing advocates have said was necessary to fight racial segregation and discrimination in housing, but which Trump claimed has raised crime and hurt housing prices in those neighborhoods. Critics have called out the racist overtones of equating low-income housing with crime and neighborhood decline. And some accused Trump of racism again on Tuesday, especially after he called out Booker — a Black senator — for supporting the low-income housing expansion. Trump said Monday that Democrats are trying to build “low-income housing projects right in the middle of your neighborhood,” and argued that if Biden gets elected president, “it’s gonna go at a much higher rate than ever before, and you know who’s gonna be in charge of it? Cory Booker.” Trump also called the Black Lives Matter movement a “Marxist organization,” and once again claimed to have done more for America’s Black community than any president in history, “except for maybe Abraham Lincoln.” Catch the full interview here.

    "text": "The largest election bet of this campaign cycle was placed on President Donald Trump to win another four-year term, according to U.K. exchange Betfair. Betfair said a £50,000 ($67,300) bet was placed on Trump, which, if he’s re-elected, would pay out £104,000. Over £1 million was staked in the last 24 hours. Trump has closed the gap against his competitor Joe Biden, the former vice president, in betting markets. On Tuesday afternoon, there was a roughly even chance Biden would win, and slightly more than an even bet on a Trump victory. Those are Biden’s longest odds since June 5. He has had a polling lead for months nationally and in virtually all swing states. Nate Silver, the editor in chief of the statistics site FiveThirtyEight, tweeted it’s “insane” to think that polls are erroneous to a degree that would eliminate Biden’s current six- to seven-point lead in aggregated national polling because of so-called shy Trump voters.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/we-can-get-through-this-how-to-manage-your-mental-health-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic-2020-03-30?mod=home-page",
    "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic poses an obvious threat to physical safety, but advocates stress that Americans shouldn’t sleep on their mental health. They’re not alone. More than half of U.S. adults (53%) report that coronavirus-related stress and worry have negatively affected their mental health, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation poll conducted in July — a 14-percentage point increase from two months earlier. Women, Black adults, younger adults, and people who have had trouble affording household expenses due to the pandemic’s financial impact are more likely to report a negative impact on their mental health. Meanwhile, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report published this month found that U.S. adults had reported “considerably elevated adverse mental health conditions associated with COVID-19” during a survey administered June 24 to June 30. “Younger adults, racial/ethnic minorities, essential workers, and unpaid adult caregivers reported having experienced disproportionately worse mental health outcomes, increased substance use, and elevated suicidal ideation,” the report said. While the shared experience of navigating a pandemic can help individuals connect with one another, “it also is going to be different for different people, so that can create its own challenges,” Christine Moutier, the chief medical officer of the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, told MarketWatch in March. A variety of stressors, including job loss, poor health, self-isolation and quarantine, and general anxiety and uncertainty, could negatively impact mental health. Some people may also be struggling with existing conditions such as substance-use disorders or depression. But “people are resilient,” said Vaile Wright, a clinical psychologist and researcher at the American Psychological Association. “We can adapt,” she said. “We can get through this.” “One hundred percent, if you’re in crisis, call a hotline,” Wright said. To access coronavirus-related crisis counseling from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s (SAMHSA) Disaster Distress Helpline, call 1-800-985-5990 or text “TalkWithUs” to 66746. You can also reach the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255, the Crisis Text Line by texting “HOME” to 741741, and the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-7233. Normalize any intense uncomfortable emotions you’re having right now, said Joan Cook, a clinical psychologist and Yale School of Medicine associate professor who studies traumatic stress. Don’t judge yourself if you feel mild anxiety or depression, loneliness, boredom, frustration or anger. This is an unprecedented time for all of us, she said, and “there are a lot of unknowns.” “While it’s important to ground ourselves by remembering to ‘count our blessings’ and be grateful for our lives and any privileges we have, it is equally important for us to acknowledge that social distancing, quarantine or isolation is hard,” Cook said. “And know that you are not alone in finding the consequences of social distancing, like losing our jobs or being physically distanced from family and friends, also very difficult.” Give yourself credit if you are following the social-distancing directives of federal, state and local health officials, Cook added. “It’s important that we give ourselves the recognition when we do a good job,” she said. “You’re reducing the possibility of transmitting the virus, and protecting those who are most vulnerable.” You may be out of a job or working from home, but you still need to mind your basic human needs. Establish a routine, Wright said: Get enough sleep, get dressed in the morning, take a shower and eat a healthy diet. Exercise, she added, even if it’s just by going outside for fresh air. Build structure into an otherwise loose day by scheduling all of these needs, Moutier said. “Mental health is not only critically important to pay attention to during COVID-19 for its own sake,” Moutier added, “but because the brain is connected to the body, how well we’re managing our mental health will directly affect our physical health — for example, things even like the strength of our immune system.” Laughter and play are “critically necessary” during this time, Moutier added. Moments of humor might be harder to come by right now, but try to prioritize them. If you lack an existing social-support system, “now is the time to go out and find connection with others, even if you don’t know who they are,” Wright said. Seek out online support groups or social-media communities related to your interests. After all, social distancing is actually physical distancing, Moutier said. “Socially, we can remain even closer.” The federal government has expanded access to telemedicine in response to COVID-19, as have some states. “If you are in therapy or mental-health treatment, make sure that you continue it and ask your provider specifically if they’re providing video chat or telehealth,” Moutier said. If you believe your mental health is deteriorating, seek help. “There’s evidence that shows that telehealth can be as effective as in-person treatment in many instances,” she said. The present situation “could be a tipping point for not just acceptance for telehealth, but also removing the barriers to it around reimbursement and access,” Wright said. Look for an app that has scientific backing, as well as mental or behavioral-health experts who served as subject-matter experts, Wright said. Understand the app’s privacy policy and where your data might go, and look through the reviews. Experts praise the Department of Veteran Affairs’ line of health apps, which includes apps for PTSD coping and mood boosting. Is your anxious mind racing at 100 miles per hour? Theresa Nguyen, the chief program officer for the nonprofit Mental Health America, suggested the mental-heath technique of grounding. “Grounding is a technique to use your five senses and just bring your attention to the present moment,” she said. “It’s very effective, because your mind can only think about one thing at a time.” If you’re gardening, for example, put your hand in the soil and just focus on that. Touch whatever is around you or try reciting a mantra to yourself, and remember to breathe deeply. We sometimes hold our breath when we are anxious or working hard, which can also exacerbate our anxiety, mental-health professionals say. Engage in activities you know will help you feel healthy and centered, Moutier said, whether it’s exercise like yoga, walking or running, or hobbies like reading, crafting or music. Relax yourself with deep breathing exercises. “Not everyone is a nature person, but there is a fairly common experience that being in nature is grounding in and of itself,” she added. Take each day as it comes. Much about the future of the pandemic remains unknown, and it’s easy to feel a sense of impending doom. Try to shorten the time frame of your perspective, Nguyen said: “If you find yourself going to, ‘What if the world is going to end?’ you want to bring it back a little closer to, ‘What am I going to do in two days, what am I going to do today, what does it look like right now?’” This article was originally published March 30, 2020, and has been updated. An executive order by President Donald Trump called for distributing an additional $300 in weekly unemployment benefits from a $44 billion fund set aside for disaster relief.

    "text": "New York City — Today is day 141. I’ll save you doing the math: Day 1 was April 3. It was a Friday, a month before my 46th birthday when the doctor at my local walk-in clinic told me to consider this Day 1 of COVID. Like everyone else in New York, I was already quarantining and my wife was just getting over the virus, though I hadn’t been overly concerned about getting it myself. The doctor’s last words to me were to expect a couple of rough weeks ahead — she’d seen it hit runners extra hard. Sometimes, I feel embarrassed calling myself a runner — I’ve never done a marathon and I didn’t discover my love of running until my 30s. But for over a decade, I’ve been running five or six miles several times a week. Pre-COVID me could run up the steps from Riverside Park to street level without a problem and do a decent time in a 10-kilometer race. Pre-COVID me did not get short of breath sitting on the couch as I had done the night before. For the next two weeks, running was the farthest thing from my mind. Navigating the journey from the bed to the couch so my wife could tackle the sweat-drenched sheets was as much as I could handle. My fever bounced around 102, refusing to come down even with Tylenol. My doctor put me on hydroxychloroquine — a drug that has since been discredited by many in the medical community as an effective treatment for coronavirus — and texted several times a day, telling me if my blood oxygen fell lower, I would have to go to the ER. Back at the walk-in clinic on Day 14, a chest X-ray revealed secondary pneumonia. My wife and I are the same age and neither with underlying conditions. Her COVID presented as body aches, nausea and fatigue. We had been dealt totally different versions of this chameleon virus. The day the fever broke was a miracle. I woke naturally with a clear-ish mind. The sheets were dry, the thought of food was not repulsive. The thermometer confirmed what I already knew and I felt elated — I was cured! It lasted quite a while — the elation — and I even wrote about my experience. That my energy levels were still on the floor three weeks later, that I still needed my inhaler was to be expected. I had to be patient. Patience is not my strong suit and around Day 40 — frustrated with sticking to the three-block walking limit suggested by my doctor — I decided to make the jump to six. But three blocks from home, panic set in — my body had hit a wall, I would never make it back. I did, of course, shuffling, sitting, shuffling again. Runners of all ages loped by me and I hated them all. Over the next few weeks, I tried increasing my walking distance, every time paying the price with chest pains, breathlessness and a crippling fatigue. My wife told me I was doing too much, that I looked like a ghost after these excursions. But it was past Day 50, coming towards the end of May. Over a disjointed telehealth call that dropped three times I tried to explain my symptoms to my doctor through my iPhone screen. He told me he’d get me in to see him as soon as in-person visits started again. Looking back, those days — in the 60s — were the worst, when the fear that I might never get better really started to take hold. By then, I’d gotten my life back — I was working from home and, on a good day, I could walk 10, even 12 blocks. But the trade-off was a fatigue that kept me couch-bound for hours, intermittent chest pains and the need for an inhaler. My days set aside for writing became recuperation days and my novel remained untouched. Popping out to get something from the shop, making dinner, even talking on the phone were activities that were out of reach. Sure, I had my life back, but it wasn’t my life. It was someone else’s life. At least, that is how it felt. On Day 68, I read my doctor a list of my symptoms. And of all the tests and medical information he gave me that day, the most important thing I learned was that many of his younger patients had the same lingering symptoms I had. Until that point, as far as I knew, there were only three types of COVID: The mild version, the version that put you in hospital and the version that killed you. I didn’t know there were others like me, stuck on a post-COVID plateau, not sick anymore, but not better either. It turned out we were a group who had a name: We were COVID long-haulers. The Mayo Clinic and medical journals had published pieces about us. We had support groups on social media. We even had a hashtag. We were frustrated and afraid. When people asked us if we were feeling better, we mostly said, “Yes,” because anything else was too complicated. Those days that followed my doctor’s appointment marked a turning point of sorts. Don’t get me wrong, the 70s and 80s were no picnic and the 90s had some real challenges too. Even earlier today — midway through this piece — I had to take a nap. Pre-COVID me was not a napper. But as with anything difficult I’ve ever faced, knowing that I’m not alone and being able to share and listen to others has been a huge part not only of my healing, but of my acceptance of the impact of this virus. With my doctor’s guidance I introduced a very slow five-minute jog into my already slow walking schedule. The first time I did it, my chest burned and I doubled over, hands on knees, gasping for breath. But there was something about knowing these symptoms were to be expected and not feared that changed my attitude, something about scheduling time to recover in advance that helped me not to resist it. In the brief weeks before 2020 became “2020” I had toyed with training for a marathon. Since day 68, I’ve applied the same single-mindedness of purpose to my physical recovery as I imagine I would have to that kind of training. Except the goal isn’t 26 miles. Today’s goal was 30 minutes. I know I am one of the lucky ones. I can’t run as far or as fast as before but I know others who would love to be where I am. And one day, I hope to be fully back to my pre-COVID self. I’ll keep counting until I get there.

    "title": "It seemed safe to reopen Israel’s schools, but then came COVID-19 outbreaks — what can the U.S. learn from those mistakes?",
    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/former-israeli-coronavirus-task-force-chairman-it-seemed-safe-to-reopen-schools-but-then-came-the-outbreaks-2020-09-01?mod=home-page",
    "text": "After Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu implemented a strict lockdown in Israel in February, by early May, roughly a dozen daily new cases of coronavirus down from more than 750 per day were being reported among the country’s population of roughly 9 million people. By last month, Israel had hit 2,300 new cases in one day. But three months ago, the cost of reopening schools with so few cases of coronavirus did not seem to come close to the benefits that were believed to be gained from holding in-person classes — or so the Israeli government thought. However, a heat wave that made it difficult for students to wear masks, full classrooms that made social distancing near-impossible and, perhaps, the illusion that the virus had been vanquished all contributed to a false sense of security. Within days of reopening schools on May 17, one of the largest coronavirus outbreaks in the country occurred, prompting many schools to revert to online instruction. The hardest-hit school was Gymnasia Rehavia, a middle school and high school in the county’s capital, Jerusalem, where some 153 students and 25 staff members tested positive for coronavirus. As Rebecca Nussbaum, a teacher, told The World radio program of the first attempt to reopen schools in Israel: “We did not feel like we had any adequate time to prepare for that, in order to make sure the school was appropriately equipped for that many students coming back in one go.” “To everybody’s surprise in the school, the Thursday night before we were going back on the Sunday, we were in a staff meeting about how capsules would work; it was 9 o’clock at night and a news report came out saying that schools were opening as normal,” she added. Now the country has become a cautionary tale for what NOT to do when reopening schools. To date, Israel has reported 116,596 cases of coronavirus and 939. That translates to 10.34 deaths per 100,000 of the population or a 0.8% fatality rate. To put that in comparison, the U.S. has reported 55.95 deaths per 100,000 people and a fatality rate of 3.1%. The Israeli government now has a staggered system of return under its “Safe Learning” program. The country’s education ministry said approximately 2.4 million children and 205,000 education workers have resumed their school year. There will be smaller capsules for older students, and a mixture of online and in-person classes. MarketWatch spoke with Eli Waxman, a professor at the Weizmann Institute of Science and former chairman of the team advising Israel’s National Security Council on the pandemic, to understand what went wrong and what the U.S. and other countries can learn. Waxman left his position at the NSC in May after the recommendations his team made were ignored by the Israeli government, the Times of Israel reported. Eli Waxman: The contact tracing infrastructure was not built. Due to hurdles and objections within the health ministry, and due to the lack of the decision by the political level. And so we reopened physically without having this infrastructure, so there was no way to control new outbreaks. We proposed the gradual relief of social distancing measures starting with activities that are less dangerous such as construction and only later opening commerce and schools very gradually. Due to the political pressures, this program was not implemented, far from it, and all the restrictions were relieved, almost at the same time, and without proper regulations prepared for conduct in public places. So the combination of these factors led to the new uncontrolled outbreak that we’ve seen in June and July. EW: There was no plan. The health ministry was totally unprepared and, in parallel, they also removed restrictions. The original plan was to first resume activity at the lower grades up to third-grade and with reduced numbers of students per class, with masks and alcogels [disinfectants] and, after monitoring the situation for a couple of weeks, considering the resumption of activity for higher grades. We started with the lower grades and, in three days, all the grades were back to school and all the restrictions were removed. It was no surprise that we had these outbreaks. There were no capabilities to trace contacts and to isolate them and there was no way to stop the spread. EW: There are several steps that have been taken. One major development was the realization by the government and by the health ministry that an efficient and strong contact-tracing capability should be used. It was also accepted that the health ministry is not capable of doing this, and the responsibility for the construction [of this system] was moved to the army. This is something that we were recommending for months and it didn’t happen. This has happened now, and the army is building this capability. It is not set yet it is not ready but it will be ready I hope within a couple of weeks. There still debates about how school activity would resume. Some argue that the plan should be gradual, as I just described. Starting with lower grades and reducing the number of students per class, and walking in capsules, and requiring safety measures like masks and alcogels. I hope this will be implemented but it’s not at all clear to me because there are pressures to resume all activity of all grades at the same time. I’m worried that if this happens due to the pressures then we will face again serious danger of uncontrollable outbreaks. MW: A lot of countries are looking at Israel now as an example of what NOT to do. But is there anything your country has done well that you feel is not getting enough recognition? EW: The response to the first outbreak. The sooner you act, the faster you suppress the outbreak and the faster you can resume activity. The decision to close down flights and also to close school activity, and then to apply more restrictions on general activity — I think this was done in the right way early on. It allowed us to get very low numbers in April ‘and May. However, the steps that should have been taken during the time between early March and mid-May — the construction of the contact-tracing capability and setting up rules for a gradual resumption of activity — did not happen. These steps are crucial for safe resumption of activity in the presence of the virus. EW: I’m not confident because of the pressures for reopening not gradually and without precaution measures. So it really depends on how it will be done this time. If we repeat the same thing that we did last time we are going to face serious problems. I hope that we will not do it again.

    "title": "41 states have been approved to offer $300 extra in unemployment benefits — here are the 6 that have started to distribute it",
    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/some-americans-have-started-to-receive-the-extra-300-in-unemployment-benefits-if-you-live-in-these-states-youre-next-on-the-list-2020-08-19?mod=home-page",
    "text": "Unemployed people in Arizona were the first Americans to start receiving an extra $300 in weekly unemployment benefits Aug. 17 under an executive order issued by President Donald Trump, and since then, 41 other states have been approved to hand out the money — but only six are doing so. Laid-off workers shouldn’t get too used to the extra cash: it will likely dry up in a matter of weeks. The memorandum Trump signed Aug. 8 at his New Jersey golf club called for a “Lost Wages Assistance” program to distribute an additional $300 in weekly federal unemployment benefits on top of the state benefits that unemployed people typically receive. The source of that extra $300 is a $44 billion fund set aside for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan think-tank, estimates the funds won’t last more than five weeks. There is another significant caveat —  jobless Americans are only eligible for the $300 add-on if they already receive at least $100 a week in benefits from their state. Therefore, nearly 1 million Americans who receive less than $100 a week would be ineligible for the add-on benefit, Eliza Forsythe, a labor economist and assistant professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, calculated. The Lost Wages Assistance payments aren’t automatic. States must apply through FEMA for a grant “to administer the supplemental payments for lost wages.” States will have to pay 25% of the cost of delivering the extra $300. (The FEMA grants do not cover that expense.) So far no states who have applied for the FEMA grants have been rejected, Keith Turi, Assistant Administrator of Recovery at FEMA, told reporters Aug 20. At least one governor has said her state won’t apply for the FEMA grant because residents don’t need the extra $300. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, a Republican and Trump ally, said she won’t be submitting an application. “My administration is very grateful for the additional flexibility that this effort would have provided, but South Dakota is in the fortunate position of not needing to accept it,” she said in a statement. “South Dakota’s economy, having never been shut down, has recovered nearly 80% of our job losses.” Alabama received FEMA’s approval on Aug. 21. Based on estimates from FEMA and the U.S. Department of Labor, the Alabama Department of Labor said eligible unemployment beneficiaries could expect to receive the $300 add-on benefit ”in approximately three weeks.” Alaska received FEMA’s approval on Aug. 23. Alaskans likely won’t receive those benefits for at least six to eight weeks, Cathy Muñoz, Deputy Commissioner at the Department of Labor and Workforce Development, said. As of Aug. 26, more than $252 million was distributed to unemployed Arizonans to make the extra $300 payments according to Arizona’s Department of Economic Security. Approximately 400,000 unemployment beneficiaries in the state have received the $300 supplemental unemployment benefit that was retroactively paid for the first week and second week of August. Arkansas received FEMA’s approval on Aug. 25. It’s not yet clear when unemployed individuals will start to receive the add-on benefit. California received FEMA’s approval on Aug. 21. At first California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat and critic of Trump, did not support the executive order. Then he decided to apply for the add-on benefit. “As I say, don’t look a gift horse in the mouth,” he said on Aug. 10. The Employment Development Department of California said it “will begin processing LWA payments in phases for eligible individuals in the week beginning September 7, 2020.” Colorado received FEMA’s approval on Aug. 16, but the state’s Department of Labor and Employment has “not yet determined what the benefit amount will be nor do we have any estimate on development timelines to reprogram our systems to pay these benefits,” Cher Haavind, a spokeswoman for the department, told MarketWatch. Connecticut received FEMA’s approval on Aug. 24. “The agency anticipates disbursement in mid-September and expects about 250,000 claimants will be eligible for the federal benefit,” according to an Aug. 21 statement published by the Connecticut Department of Labor. Florida received FEMA’s approval on Aug. 29. It’s not yet clear when unemployed Floridians will start to receive the add-on benefit. Georgia received FEMA’s approval on Aug. 23. It will likely take three to four weeks for the Georgia Department of Labor to start distributing the add-on benefit, said Kersha Cartwright, a spokeswoman for the agency. Hawaii received FEMA’s approval on Aug. 29. “We’re diligently building a new program within the unemployment computer system to implement and pay LWA benefits as soon as possible,” said Acting Director Anne E. Perreira-Eustaquio of the Hawaii Department of Labor and Industrial Relations in an Aug. 27 statement. Idaho received FEMA’s approval on Aug. 19. “To ensure individuals who need it most are receiving the new benefit, [Gov. Brad] Little directed the Idaho Department of Labor to identify ways to ensure the $300 per week in additional benefits is also provided to individuals who receive less than $100 per week in unemployment benefits,” an Aug. 19 statement reads. It’s not clear if the state will have to pay out an additional $100 to every jobless resident or make up the difference so that each claimant receives at least $100 a week in benefits. The department did not immediately respond to MarketWatch’s request for a comment. Indiana received FEMA’s approval on Aug. 21. “The State of Indiana, through the Department of Workforce Development, has applied for funding under this federal program and plans to begin providing it to eligible Hoosiers within the next three to four weeks,” states a notice posted on the department’s site. Iowa received FEMA’s approval on Aug. 14, one day after submitting an application. The state’s labor department, known as Iowa Workforce Development, declined to provide details on when jobless Iowans could expect to receive the add-on benefit. Kentucky received FEMA’s approval on Aug. 21. Kentucky will be contributing an additional $100 a week on top of the $300 federal benefit. That will boost unemployment benefits for every Kentuckian by $400 a week. “While the application is approved, reconfiguring the computer systems to pay the $400 is likely to take about two weeks,” a statement put out by Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, a Democrat, states. “Therefore, benefits recipients should not expect the payments until sometime in early September.” Louisiana received FEMA’s approval on Aug. 14. More than 300,000 eligible claimants received the add-on benefit as of Aug. 26, and another 50,000 people are expected to receive it on Aug. 27. In total, the Louisiana Workforce Commission said it expected to distribute $284 million this week to make the $300 add-on payment. Maine received FEMA’s approval on Aug. 25. The Maine Department of Labor estimates that it will take three weeks to being issuing the benefit. Maryland received FEMA’s approval on Aug. 20. “While it will take some time to work with the federal administration to implement this new program, all claimants will receive benefit payments retroactive to their earliest date of eligibility within the new program,” Maryland Department of Labor Secretary Tiffany Robinson said in an Aug. 19 statement. Unemployment beneficiaries will start receiving the add-on benefit in late September, the agency said. Massachusetts received FEMA’s approval on Aug. 21. The state has highest unemployment rate, 16.1%, in the country, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the month of July.  It’s unclear when Massachusetts residents will start receiving the $300 add-on benefit. Michigan received FEMA’s approval on Aug. 21. The Michigan Unemployment Insurance Agency estimates that “about 910,000 Michiganders would receive at least $300 per week in supplemental benefits,” according to an Aug. 18 statement. The agency has not indicated when Michiganders can expect to receive the add-on benefit. Minnesota received FEMA’s approval on Aug. 29. The state waiting for the U.S. Treasury “transfer LWA funding into our bank account,” according to a notice posted by the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development. “Once we receive these funds, we expect we will be able to implement the new program immediately. The Minnesota Unemployment Insurance Program has already taken all the necessary administrative steps to implement the new program.” Mississippi received FEMA’s approval on Aug. 22. “It will be approximately three to four weeks before claimants in Mississippi start to receive these benefits,” Dianne Bell, a spokesperson for the Mississippi Department of Employment Security, told MarketWatch. “Our system must be recalibrated in order to accurately provide this service,” she added. Missouri received FEMA’s approval on Aug. 16. 100,000 eligible claimants in Missouri should receive the add-on benefit for the week ending Aug.1 by the end of this week, Rose Delores, a spokeswoman for the Missouri Department of Labor and Industrial Relations, told MarketWatch. Many should have already received it, she added. Montana received FEMA’s approval on Aug. 18. Montana will be contributing an additional $100 a week on top of the $300 federal benefit. That will boost unemployment benefits for every Montanan by $400 a week. Over $31 million has been distributed to unemployed Montanans, Gov. Steve Bullock said on Wednesday. New Mexico received FEMA’s approval on Aug. 15. “It is unclear at this time when funding will become available, or how much funding is available,” Workforce Solutions Secretary Bill McCamley said in an Aug. 13 statement. The state agency did not directly respond to MarketWatch’s request for a comment. New York received FEMA’s approval on Aug. 23. “We are diligently working to update our systems so we can administer the Lost Wages Assistance program and deliver supplemental benefits to New Yorkers as quickly as possible,” said Deanna Cohen, spokeswoman for the New York State Department of Labor. North Carolina received FEMA’s approval on Aug. 21. North Carolina Division of Employment Security said the agency “has been working to reprogram its benefits system and set up the accounting process to make payments to eligible North Carolinians as quickly as possible. Updates on a timeline for payments will be provided as more information is available.” North Dakota received FEMA’s approval on Aug. 31. “Job Service North Dakota estimates that approximately 17,600 claimants in North Dakota — about 41% of the current active claimant base — will receive the $300 benefit for three weeks before the funding is exhausted,” according to a Sept. 1 statement by Gov. Doug Burgum. “Job Service anticipates distributing the Lost Wages Assistance payments by mid-September,” the statement added. New Hampshire received FEMA’s approval on Aug. 24. It’s unclear when New Hampshirites will start to receive the add-on benefit. Ohio received FEMA’s approval on Aug. 26. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said eligible unemployed Ohioans can expect to receive the add-on benefit by mid-September at a press conference earlier this week. Oklahoma received FEMA’s approval on Aug. 18, one day after submitting an application. The Oklahoma Employment Security Commission told MarketWatch that Oklahomans could expect to receive the add-on benefit within four to five weeks and that the benefit will be “retroactive to Aug. 1, and all eligible claimants will receive back pay to that date once changes to the system have been put into production.” “Working with legacy technology to implement this benefit will hinder the agency’s ability to make quick changes to the system, but our team will work as fast as possible given the constraints that exist dealing with 40-year-old technology,” OESC Interim Executive Director Shelley Zumwalt said in an Aug 17. statement. Oregon received FEMA’s approval on Aug. 28. It’s unclear when people will start to receive the add-on benefit. “We hope we are looking at a few weeks, but we’re really not certain until we get a little further into the work. As we get a more solid estimate, we will certainly share that. We don’t want people to have a false expectation of exactly when they will receive it,” Oregon Employment Department Acting Director David Gerstenfeld said ahead of the state’s approval by FEMA Pennsylvania received FEMA’s approval on Aug. 24. It’s unclear when Pennsylvanians will start to received the add-on benefits. Like many states, Gov.  Tom Wolf, a Democrat, said the state will have to reprogram its computer system to administer unemployment payments. Rhode Island received FEMA’s approval on Aug. 22. The Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training anticipates it will take two to three weeks to implement the add-on benefit, Margaux Fontaine, a spokeswoman for the department told MarketWatch. Tennessee received FEMA’s approval on Aug. 22. Tennessee started issuing the aid Wednesday, Chris Cannon, a spokesman for the Department of Labor and Workforce Development, told CNBC. Texas received FEMA’s approval on Aug. 21. Texas received $1.4 billion in funding from FEMA to distribute the $300 benefit add-on, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican said in statement. $424 million has been distributed in the form of the add-on unemployment to more than 1.7 million people as of Aug. 24, according to the Texas Workforce Commission. Utah received FEMA’s approval on Aug 16. “We anticipate Utah will be ready to distribute within three to four weeks,” Nate McDonald, a spokesman for the Utah Department of Workforce Services, told MarketWatch. “Reprogramming the system will be the biggest piece.” Vermont received FEMA’s approval on Aug. 22. The Vermont Department of Labor said it  “expects to start issuing payments to eligible Vermonters in the coming weeks.” “In addition to the application submitted to FEMA for this benefit, the Governor has requested $20 million in Coronavirus Relief funding from the Vermont Legislature to provide an additional $100 per week to eligible claimants, bringing the total benefit to $400 per week, for three weeks,” the Department said in an Aug. 24 statement. Virginia received FEMA’s approval on Aug. 26. It’s unclear at this time when Virginians will start to receive the add-on benefit. Washington received FEMA’s approval on Aug. 24. “We will implement this as quickly as possible to distribute the extra payments to Washingtonians once our application is approved,” said Employment Security Department Commissioner, Suzi LeVine, in an Aug. 20 statement. “Any additional funds to help unemployed workers are welcome – and we estimate that this will provide more than $400 million to families, individuals and our state’s economy. West Virginia received FEMA’s approval on Aug. 27. Initially West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice said the state would be contributing an additional $100 on top of the $300 add-on benefit. However, FEMA did not indicate that when it announced the state’s approval. It’s unclear when West Virginians could expect to start receive any additional benefits. Wyoming received FEMA’s approval on Aug. 28. It’s not yet clear when people will start to receive the add-on benefit. This story was updated on Sept. 1, 2020.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/my-roommate-tested-positive-for-covid-19-the-nursing-home-where-i-work-told-me-to-come-in-if-i-dont-work-theyll-fire-me-what-do-i-do-2020-08-17?mod=home-page",
    "text": "I wanted to ask you a moral or ethical question concerning COVID-19. Here’s my situation: my sister-in-law who currently lives with me has tested positive for COVID as of yesterday. I have not been tested within the past 30 days. I work in a long-term care facility/nursing home, in Pennsylvania as a certified nursing assistant. I informed my employer of the positive case in my home. I volunteered to stay home 14 days because I don’t want to risk infection to my residents I take care of, or fellow employees. My employer says they want me to wear a mask and face shield and come to work, and make sure other employees are wearing a mask properly OR go get tested again. I do NOT want to put my residents at risk and I refuse to go through that painful test again. They said they are my only two choices. Force me to work as a possible carrier or force me to test again, which I feel is against my rights. Can they give me this ultimatum? I’m assuming if I don’t follow through, they are going to fire me. This isn’t about you, as much as it is about your patients. Quarantining and having a clearer idea if you have contracted coronavirus or not are the responsible courses of action. That applies to everyone, but it particularly applies to you. A nasal-swab may be uncomfortable for a moment, but a ventilator on one of your patients would be a hell of a lot more uncomfortable. There are far worse things than a COVID-19 nasal swab. I’ve had one. It was not painful for me. Uncomfortable for a brief moment, perhaps, but it was a small price to pay. There are caveats: A nasal swab test is not 100% accurate, as the doctor or nurse who administers the test will tell you, and there’s nothing preventing you from being infected after you take the test. However, focusing on that is only going to fuel your indignation and anger against your employer, and distract you from the main issue. This dilemma is about your patients, who are among the most vulnerable population. Nursing homes around the world have been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic because COVID-19 was transmitted from workers and/or visitors. The Moneyist: I filed a joint tax return with my estranged wife because she is a gambler and her finances are a mess. But I got NO stimulus check — what can I do? Unfortunately, not all nursing homes in the U.S. have been following the right protocols. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in Pennsylvania last week announced that it had imposed $15 million in fines and tripled the most severe type of citations to nursing homes during the first six months of the pandemic. Your employer could be next on that list. More than 3,400 nursing homes in the U.S. have been cited for noncompliance with infection-control requirements and/or failure to report COVID-19 data, the Pennsylvania Health Care Association said. The U.S. has had the highest number of deaths in nursing homes in the world, and has one of the highest rates of COVID-related nursing-home deaths per capita. The Moneyist: I didn’t get my stimulus check because I owe back child support. It’s not fair. My stepchildren rely on me — what can I do? In Pennsylvania, nearly 70% of fatalities associated with COVID-19 have occurred within nursing homes or other long-term care settings, according to this letter from four senators to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This is all useful information to have when responding to your employer. In the meantime, you can also fill out this online form provided by the Pennsylvania Department of Health to report workplace violations. You should NOT go to work if you have been in contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. Know your rights. Know the rules. And act upon them. Coronavirus update: As of late Tuesday, COVID-19 has infected 25,587,737 people worldwide, which mostly does not account for asymptomatic cases, and killed 852,851. The U.S. still has the world’s highest number of COVID-19 cases (6,068,139), followed by Brazil (3,908,272), India (3,691,166) and Russia (997,072), according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University. In the meantime, cases keep rising in the U.S. with California becoming the first state in the country to surpass 700,000 confirmed cases; infections there hit 712,475 as of Tuesday with 13,022 COVID-related deaths. New York has recorded 434,756 infections and the highest number of deaths in the U.S. (32,957).

    "text": "A friend of mine is getting married next month with a handful of guests, mainly family and close friends. The wedding itself was put off because of the coronavirus pandemic. They are having a large party next year. I was only invited to that. If I do send a wedding present, do I give my gift now or later? I want to make sure I’m not intrusive. Send a gift. Send it now. Send it later. Apologies for being glib. I’m trying to keep it light. We all need some levity and perspective during these turbulent times. Whether you do it now or later is less important. There’s no right or wrong answer as to when. The world is upside down, after all. At the very least, send a bottle of champagne or a bunch of flowers with a card saying, “I hope you have a wonderful day. I can’t wait for the party next year.” The only gift of this pandemic is having a reason to help each other. What other reason do we have for roaming the earth? Who would have thought that a pandemic would have so rudely interrupted our work, life and even our weddings? Petty preoccupations have no place in our lives. Looking out for one another is our No. 1, No. 2 and No. 3 reason for being alive. There really is no other. Here’s another story about a wedding that did and didn’t happen: Friends of mine were due to get married on the Greek island of Paros a few years ago. There were high winds on the sea the day of the wedding ceremony. We all went to bed the night before the wedding under a cloud. The Moneyist: My mother’s will says her boyfriend can live in her home after she dies. Can I still kick him out if the deed is transferred to me? The next morning the bride and her bridesmaids were getting their hair done and word came through: The priest, who had the keys to the ONLY Catholic Church on the island, was unable to make the trip from the mainland. Despite that unforeseen turn of events, the wedding ceremony went ahead on the steps of the town hall, with a narrow pebbled street that wound its way down to the town center acting as the aisle.Not only did the wedding go ahead, but it was more special than anyone could have imagined. The father of the bride made a speech, invoking the Greek gods of wind and sea. We partied like it was 1999. (It was, in fact, just a couple of years later.) The moral of this love story? What could have been a huge negative (no priest) turned into a giant positive (fun story). The priest arrived the next day and they did it all over again. They met their first challenge as a not-quite-legally-married couple with grace and humor.  Your friends won’t care if you give them a gift now or later, as long as you let them know the wind is blowing on their sails too.

    "title": "My sister-in-law moved in with her mother, changed her will and inherited everything. Is it too late to claim what belongs to us?",

    "text": "I read your column often, and now I find that I could use your advice. My husband’s aunt passed away earlier this year. His uncle passed many years ago, and had a will set up to be split equally between my husband and his siblings. (His aunt and uncle were well off, and had no kids). After his uncle died, his oldest sister became the care giver, even though their aunt was in good health and had a long-term care policy. Sometime within the past few years, this oldest sister took the aunt to update her will, and changed it to a trust to have her be the only beneficiary and executor. She is a compulsive liar and has not been honest about anything concerning the trust. There is talk about elder abuse, but we cannot prove it. We believe she isolated their aunt. A few years ago, cards and letters we sent her were returned. No one was able to visit her. (This was before COVID-19). My husband and I live in another state and were not able to visit. Do you have any advice? Don’t become distracted by your feelings for your husband’s sister. It’s easy to let family resentments fester and luxuriate in them. If you want your husband and his siblings to be made whole, and receive what you believe is rightfully theirs, act now. It is often the case in these kinds of situations that the person named the executor thinks they call all the shots and are free to help themselves, and act as they see fit but, in fact, just the opposite is true. You are at a disadvantage living so far away. You weren’t there to see what actually went on. You will need to hire a lawyer in the state where your sister-in-law lives and mother-in-law resides. She is beholden to the laws of her state where your mother-in-law died, and must act accordingly. An executor must always fulfill his/her “fiduciary duty,” which essentially puts the onus on the fiduciary to place the interests of other interested parties ahead of their own. The Moneyist: I filed a joint tax return with my estranged wife because she is a gambler and her finances are a mess. But I got NO stimulus check — what can I do? Typically, you only have a limited amount of time to contest a will, assuming she made a new one, or trust. This varies from state to state, and it’s often better to act before and/or as soon as possible after the will is filed. This period of time could run from months to several years. In California, for example, you have 120 days to petition the court once probate is opened, although lawyers generally say that it’s better to contest a will before it’s deemed a valid will by the probate court. In Michigan, If the will is admitted by an informal proceeding (by “application”), there is no statute of limitations for contesting the will; however, a challenger may be prevented from contesting the will due to an unreasonable delay in bringing the claim,” according to Clark Hill law firm. “If a will is admitted by formal proceeding (by “petition”), the challenger must raise his or her claims by filing Objections prior to the admission of the will.” The Moneyist: I didn’t get my stimulus check because I owe back child support. It’s not fair. My stepchildren rely on me — what can I do? Undue influence or elder abuse is normally very difficult to prove, but isolation and control is one of the hallmarks. “Isolation is a red flag and many studies of elder abuse say a lack of a good support system and physical and psychological isolation are hallmarks of the problem,” according to the National Adult Protective Services Association. The more people keeping an eye on the elderly the better: Over 90% of reported cases of abuse involve a family member or a trusted care giver. There are 1 million cases of elder abuse reported to National Adult Protective Services Association per year, which is a small fraction of overall cases. U.S. states are currently working on compiling a database of national elder abuse data. The National Center on Elder Abuse, a government agency affiliated with the U.S. Administration on Aging, reports that elder abuse lags by as much as “two decades” behind research into fields of child abuse and domestic violence. I hope you find the resolution you need and, if it’s too late to pursue, the peace you require to move on from this situation and focus on your own lives. I assume that’s what your mother-in-law would want for both you and your husband.

    "text": "I am a 65-year-old woman married to a great guy for decades. We have no children. He earns all the money and handles all our finances. During my entire life I have not been a good money manager. I love to spend money and have a head-in-the-sand approach to money problems. Before our marriage, I bounced checks often. My fear is that I will outlive my husband, and then have no one to check my spending impulses. We owe less than $200,000 on our home, which is valued at over $2.5 million. We have another $1.2 million in retirement funds. He has a $1 million life-insurance policy. We intend to retire within three years, sell this home, and relocate within California to a smaller home costing around $450,000. So, should he predecease me, I will have possibly a huge sum of money at my disposal. At the moment, we have a family trust and living wills. Your husband could set up a trust for you that gives you a monthly income, with provisions for emergencies, and you can talk to a financial planner about all of those options. That continues the model you have both set up for yourselves now: He manages the money, you go along with his decisions, and he oversees how you spend and manage your money. You can only learn how to manage a household budget, prioritize bills, refrain from making impulsive purchases and put something aside for a rainy day if you actually do it. The best time to start is now, not when your husband passes away, assuming he predeceases you. This column is about money, but it’s also about relationships, and chief among those is the relationship we have with ourselves. Starting today, you can learn about income and expenditure, and/or having an account for an emergency fund in case you get sick or require a new car or a roof on your home. Your husband can help you, of course, but I suggest taking a money-management class in an effort to build your confidence and become more independent. You don’t want a trust to replace your husband. The Moneyist: My mother’s will says her boyfriend can live in her home after she dies. Can I still kick him out if the deed is transferred to me? We all have things that we put off in life — that one thing that we hold onto that holds us back. It could be related to finance or romance. Or, in this case, both. The key is to ask yourself why you do it and why you are comfortable with your husband taking care of all of your needs, even though you know your Jiminy Cricket is tapping you on the shoulder to say, “This is not 100% healthy for you.” A financial therapist or counselor can help you with that too. The biggest lie we tell ourselves is that all the money decisions we made in life were based on our “adulting” or being a grown up, or taking decisive action and empowering ourselves. Every decision, whether it’s buying a new pair of shoes, selling or buying stocks, or even purchasing a house, is on some level an emotional one. Why do you allow your husband to take care of the finances, even though you know it may leave you at a disadvantage if he predeceases you? Why do you like having those boundaries around spending set by others rather than yourself? It may be familiar territory to you. It could make you feel safe and protected and cared for, even if it doesn’t make the adult in you feel good about yourself. In many ways, embarking on this journey is exciting. It’s a gift you are giving yourself. Learning more about your motivations and behavior will be invaluable, especially if your husband passes away and you are left to deal with life alone. Every time you make a smart decision, you can say, “My husband would be proud.” But you can also say, “I am proud of myself. I did this alone. I’m doing OK.” You can email The Moneyist with any financial and ethical questions related to coronavirus at qfottrell@marketwatch.com Would you like to sign up to an email alert when a new Moneyist column has been published?

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/traditional-long-term-care-policies-can-still-work-2020-09-01?mod=home-page",
    "text": "I recently wrote that the market for long-term care insurance, which was growing rapidly 20 years ago, has shrunk dramatically. When the market boomed, insurers bet that over time policyholders would let their policies lapse. Instead, many more people who had long-term care insurance (which covers the cost of skilled care and assisted living or nursing home facilities) held on to their policies, and when they tapped into them to pay for care, insurers sometimes had to pay out benefits in the six-figure range. So, the companies jacked up prices and pushed regulators for aggressive rate increases for existing customers, while many insurers stopped writing new policies altogether. But there are still some good deals for people who want traditional long-term care policies. So, I contacted Brian Gordon, president of long-term care specialist MAGA Ltd. (Murray A. Gordon Associates, not Make America Great Again). The firm, which was started by his father Murray in 1975, is based in Bannockburn, Illinois. First of all, Gordon told me, there’s a myth that Medicare covers long-term care expenses; it covers only the limited costs of recovery from acute medical conditions, like a stroke. For the rest, you’re on your own. “We’ve always told our clients to anticipate Medicare doing nothing,” he said. Medicaid does pay for long-term care, but you’ll have to spend down your own assets before you qualify, and the quality of care can leave a lot to be desired. If you’re rich, on the other hand, you can pay out of pocket. “I’ve got clients today who can buy a nursing facility. They can live there by themselves and they would still have plenty of money left,” Gordon said. Long-term care insurance is best, he told me, for people with net assets of $500,000 and up. They can’t afford to pay the entire cost of an extended nursing home stay, and long-term care insurance could help them cover their care while preserving assets to leave to their heirs. How much coverage should you look for? “Most people we work with are looking to cover anywhere from about 50% to about 75% of the cost of care,” he told me. “So, if the cost of care is, say, $10,000 a month, my clients are usually looking at between about $5,000 and about $7,500 a month in benefits.” Gordon says his clients range in age from the 40s to the 70s, although it’s harder for older people to buy long-term care policies and the premiums are much higher. “I would say somewhere in our early, mid-50s is usually a good time to buy it,” he said. How much should you pay at that time? “Our average premium on a traditional long-term care plan is probably a little bit over $3,000 a year,” he said. Gordon prepared several hypothetical quotes from a major insurer for Retirement Weekly. The premium for a 55-year-old male who buys a policy that pays $170 a day ($5,000 a month) for three years with a 3% inflation adjustment would be around $2,000 a year. A woman of the same age with the same benefits would pay $1,200 a year more. (Women live on average about five years longer than men do.) Add another year to the benefit period and the premium would be about $300 higher for the man and $700 for the woman. A shared plan for a 55-year-old female/male couple costs just over $4,200 annually for a three-year benefit period and a bit more than $5,000 for four years. That couple discount amounts to $1,000 for three years of coverage and $1,200 for four years. Big age differences between spouses make it more complicated, but in this case, you’d pay just under 20% less for a joint policy than you would for coverage of two individuals. Since women tend to be in long-term care on average 1.5 years longer than men do, a four-year benefits term makes sense for them while three years should suffice for most men. You might look for more coverage in states like Hawaii and Connecticut, where semiprivate rooms in nursing homes cost around $12,000 a month, double what they cost in Texas or Oklahoma. And though some legacy plans include inflation riders of 5%, these days paying for 3% annual inflation protection is standard. (In the five years ending in 2018, costs of long-term care rose from 2% to 3.6% annually, according to Genworth Financial.) But the best reason to buy long-term care insurance may not be financial. “It signals to the family that when our minds were good and we were healthy, we made the decision to buy this insurance,” said Gordon. “It basically tells the family it’s OK to bring in home health care and it’s OK to put them in a nursing facility.” How much is it worth to know you won’t be a burden on your loved ones when you can no longer take care of yourself? That’s the real question to ask yourself as you consider all the options to cover long-term care. We want upscale shopping and less extreme weather than New Jersey for $7,000 a month.

    "title": "Do you need a retirement coach?",
    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/do-you-need-a-retirement-coach-2020-09-01?mod=home-page",
    "text": "This article is reprinted by permission from NextAvenue.org. While the retirement dream may be to smoothly exit your full-time job and sail into the next phase of life, the reality is that the transition is often far from easy. “We can often get overwhelmed, especially when facing changes,” says Lynell Ross, a life coach based in Auburn, Calif., and founder of Zivadream, a website designed to help people improve their lives. Maybe so. It did for Val Walker, the Boston-area author of “400 Friends and No One to Call: Breaking Through Isolation and Building Community.” “When I retired from my [rehabilitation] counseling career, approaching my 60s, I yearned to follow my life’s calling to be a writer and find someone to help me shore up my courage to write my first book,” says Walker. She then worked with a life coach who helped her realize those goals. But before bringing on a retirement coach yourself, you’ll want to understand what they do and how to size them up. The transitions surrounding retirement can lead to a time of anxiety and questioning, according to research collected by McMaster University in Ontario, Canada, which studies aging. Much of this angst may stem from a loss of identity, family tensions and a sense of loneliness. Financial factors often play a role too. Living on a fixed income can be rough and the cost of living may exceed expectations. These days, with the uncertainty lingering around the coronavirus outbreak, a retirement date that’s nearing can seem even more daunting. That’s where retirement coaches fit in. You may be familiar with life coaches, who help people evaluate themselves, grow and implement lifestyle changes. Often, a life coach will provide a working plan to help improve a specific area of your life. Retirement coaches frequently act as life coaches, with a specific focus on the retirement years. Like other life coaches, retirement coaches may specialize in certain things, such as finances or behavior. There’s even a Retirement Coaches Association, created in 2017, to establish standards for this type of coaching, enhance skills of the coaches and educate the public about this relatively new profession. A whole host of challenges can surround the transition into retirement and they’re not always obvious at first glance. “People who move might have to rebuild their social network,” says Monte Drenner, a life coach and founder of MTC Counseling, in Orlando, Fla. Retirees who want to travel — as much as the pandemic allows — might discover their savings won’t support their original trip ideas. Spouses who spent their working days apart may struggle during retirement as they suddenly see each other 24/7. Perspectives on the retirement years can be misleading, too. “Many people bring a vacation mind-set to retirement,” Drenner says. Days can quickly become dull, however, when schedules that used to be packed are no longer filled. A coach can help you work through these types of issues during retirement, but you may also benefit from starting sessions prior to the transition. “I encourage people to be proactive about preventing these struggles,” Drenner says. If possible, you could see a life coach several months or a year before retiring to start working through upcoming issues. “The majority of my clients who are reinventing in retirement tell me that this is the hardest challenge they have faced to date,” says Katy Goshtabi, a life coach and founder of Puris Consulting in San Diego. Before retiring, Goshtabi adds, “people have not stopped to figure out who they are.” It could be that a retirement coach could help you figure that out. Walker says her coach changed her whole outlook on her life, “helping me own six decades of life experience.” The coach, Walker notes, “helped me realize my life goals by teaching me how to look at my life as a series of accomplishment stories.” These accomplishments could then be valued in terms of her accumulated wisdom about living with loss and change. Fees, styles and specializations vary enormously among retirement coaches, so you’ll want to know what you’ll be getting into before hiring someone. Rates often range between $100 an hour and $300 an hour. But you may pay less or more, depending on where you live and the type of consultation you want. It’s a good idea to check for referrals before hiring a retirement coach. Then “ask if they have a free consultation to find out if you are a good match for each other,” says Ross. During a brief phone call, you’ll be able to see if your preferences, interests and expectations align. Keep in mind that paying for several hours of consultations or committing to sessions over consecutive months could lead you to a better place, overall. Regardless of whether you start working with a coach before retirement or in retirement, don’t expect immediate results to deal with your challenges. “I look at it as a marathon, not a sprint,” Goshtabi says. Coaching involves a process. Goshtabi’s clients often work through programs lasting for three to eight months. During that time, they might try out a new habit, activity or mind-set for, say, a month, and then evaluate the benefits or drawbacks from the change. They may then make further adjustments or pursue other areas. Sometimes, retirement coach clients write out their dreams, wishes and interests. Then, discoveries that bubble up might be implemented gradually over a period of time. A person noting a love of flowers might be advised to look for fulfillment working part time at a flower shop or helping an organization that donates flowers from weddings and funerals to nursing homes. Someone who enjoys cooking and writing and wants to leave a legacy to family members could develop a family cookbook in retirement. Transitions, after all, don’t happen all at once.

    "text": "Our family’s goal was to achieve financial independence assuming we will have no Social Security benefits. Our full retirement ages are over two decades away, and cuts to the program seem likely. We decided to consider any benefits we may receive as a bonus and haven’t paid much attention to Social Security. I recently shared that I’ve been helping my parents with their finances as they transition into retirement. Seeing how valuable their Social Security payment is has been eye-opening. For example, my first year of having taxed Social Security earnings was 1995. The $2,920 of income I earned cutting grass and making pizzas is currently worth over double that amount, $6,163, in 2020 dollars. PIA is your primary insurance amount and is calculated based on your AIME over your highest-earning 35 years. Up to the first bend point — $960 in 2020 — your income is replaced at 90% of your AIME. If your AIME is exactly $960, you will qualify for a monthly benefit of $864 at your full retirement age. AIME above the first bend point up to the second bend point — $5,785 in 2020 — is replaced at only 32%. For example, someone with a PIA of $1,960 would receive $1,184. Let’s focus on retiring early, meaning to stop earning or drastically reduce your taxable wages. This will impact the Social Security benefit you accumulate over your working lifetime if you have not yet accumulated 35 years of earnings. It will also impact you if you have accumulated 35 years of earnings and if the earnings you are forgoing later in life would be greater than the earnings you have already accumulated. Either scenario will decrease the average earnings compared to your potential top 35 years of earnings. When calculating your estimated benefits, Social Security assumes you will continue to work until your full retirement age. It projects future benefits based upon your earnings from the two most recent years. Therefore, the benefits you eventually receive may be more or less than the projections depending on your actual future earnings. On the “my Social Security” website, you can use the Retirement Calculator to experiment with the impact of different levels of ongoing income on your Social Security retirement benefits. My estimated benefit at full retirement age is $1,869 a month based on my 25 years of earnings between 1995 and 2019. Over the last two years, I’ve had very little income taxable by Social Security, totaling less than $6,000. My wife Kim and I currently have similar earnings records. If we each get our benefits as projected, we would receive nearly $4,000 a month at our full retirement age. That would more or less cover our current living expenses. The 25% and 100% scenarios will represent our best guess at absolute worst and best-case scenarios. The 50% and 75% scenarios represent our best guess on the likely range of values of our future Social Security benefits based on our knowledge of it today.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/pension-fund-parasites-exposed-2020-08-31?mod=home-page",
    "text": "I always thought that when I finally hung it up on journalism I would go into business providing financial advice to criminals. The more I wrote about them, the more I could see the need. (Memo to celebrities trying to get kids into college: No, do not try to deduct illegal bribes on your tax return. The IRS won’t like it.) But I’m starting to see a lucrative alternative that runs less risk of getting an awkward visit from the FBI: Pension plan “consultant.” I first encountered these characters back in 2012, when I wrote a profile for Smart Money magazine about the young Salt Lake City-based investment genius Allan Mecham. He had been beating the stock market by a wide margin year after year. But he couldn’t get approved or recommended by pension plan consultants. Instead, he said, they kept turning him down for their clients—before asking if they could invest in his fund themselves. You couldn’t make it up. There’s a fortune to be made latching on to the $37 trillion fund industry as a “consultant.” And it appears that you don’t need to have any skill. If new research is accurate, it might even be a hindrance. Investment managers hired by pension funds, endowments, foundations, and sovereign-wealth funds are actually likely to perform worse than their competitors by nearly a full percentage point a year over the next three years, according to a new study conducted by Amit Goyal of the University of Lausanne, Sunil Wahal of Arizona State University and M. Deniz Yavuz of Purdue University. The underperformance was 0.85 percentage points a year, and the study found a reasonable degree of statistical significance. “At the minimum,” they add dryly, “these results suggest plan sponsors have no discernible selection ability.” Some of this may be due to the old school tie, alumni affects and so on. Using data from Relationship Science, a database that measures professional relationships, they found that investment managers with connections to plan managers or consultants are between 15% and 30% more likely to be hired by the fund than managers without connections. You might think there was some logic to that. After all, the people running these funds, or their consultants, might use their connections and personal knowledge to hire money managers they believe to be really good, right? Dream on. The connected money managers ended up doing worse over the next three years than their non-connected, non-hired competitors by an average of 1.12% a year. “Plan sponsor connections to investment managers generate worse return outcomes,” the researchers conclude. It’s not completely irrational. Although pension plan sponsors and consultants are likely to hire investment managers they know, they do typically hire investment managers who have recently beaten their benchmarks. But they’re not picking managers who have a proven ability to keep beating their benchmarks. They’re either hiring those who’ve just had a lucky streak, or they’re seizing on that brief window of opportunity to throw some work to their pals. The work that went into this research is impressive. The researchers studied around 7,000 investment hiring decisions made by more than 2,000 plan sponsors between 2002 and 2017, involving $1.6 trillion in funds and 775 unique investment managers. In each case they compared the subsequent performance of the hired funds to competitors who offered comparable investment products in the same geographic region, style and year. The more endowments have diversified into “alternative” and exotic asset classes, the more they have left themselves at the mercy of these consultants and subpar investment managers. No wonder data now show that endowments overall have been underperforming a basic passive portfolio for at least a decade.

    "text": "As Americans have been forced to stay at home for work, school and even visits to the doctor, shares of cloud-services providers have soared. But there’s something else going on that points to a long-term trend investors need to know about: a housing shortage outside cities, and a boom in  home renovation and improvement. But variety is the spice of life — and an excellent tool to cut risk in your investment portfolio and avoid missing out on opportunities. Of course, an excellent way to play the home construction/renovation trend is through exchange traded funds that focus on appropriate industries. So we looked to three U.S. construction and home improvement-related ETFs, combined their holdings and removed their duplicates for a list of stocks. Taking the three ETFs together and eliminating duplicate holdings, we are left with a group of 69 stocks, 42 of which have had double-digit returns this year. So here’s the entire list, sorted by how well the stocks have performed this year.

As always, if you are considering direct investments in any of the stocks listed here, you need to do your own homework to form an opinion of how well you expect the company to perform over the next several years. You can see that many of the best performers have gotten well ahead of the consensus price targets.

    "text": "My supersaver in-laws have two children. I married their oldest who is also quite good at saving; the other sibling, her sister, not so much. One of my in-laws has passed and the other, I fear, is not long for this world. The discussion of the will and assets has begun. I’ve been told my spouse has a quitclaim deed for the home and the sibling for the vacation property. Right after, I was told that the will states everything is split down the middle. How can both be true? Which wins out, the will or quitclaim deeds? Secondly, I fear co-owning anything with my spouse’s sibling as it will, sooner or later, given their track record, become our financial nightmare. I can retire now and will in a few years. I don’t want a vacation home that I do not enjoy hanging over my head during my retirement. Of course, this place is very sentimental for my spouse and her whole family. This will be the third generation to own it. The first generation built it themselves. I’m hoping the quitclaim deed wins out and the sibling owns it outright. It’s a nice problem to have. But you’re right: vacation properties can be expensive to maintain, stressful to manage, and can be difficult to sell. If you feel confident about your retirement, and don’t wish to become embroiled in a project where one person may or may not pull their weight, sort it out now rather than later. You are taking the smart approach by figuring this out now, before your wife’s parent passes away. Bravo! There’s nothing worse than an unwanted vacation home becoming the topic of conversation at dinner tables for years, like a giant bedbug that refuses to be exterminated. If this property is transferred by quitclaim to your wife and/or your wife’s sister, it will override the will and not go through probate. However, if you decide to sell the property, you will have to pay tax on the increase in the value since your in-laws first built it and/or purchased the land. The Moneyist: I filed a joint tax return with my estranged wife because she is a gambler and her finances are a mess. But I got NO stimulus check — what can I do? Your sister-in-law may not be happy with receiving the vacation home if there’s another, more valuable home that goes to your wife. Assuming your wife is in agreement and the rest of the assets are split 50/50, you can save yourself the trouble of managing the property. Now a warning: This does not preclude your sister-in-law asking for help or getting into financial trouble that requires selling her vacation home. If you give up complete control, be prepared — in a worst-case scenario — to see the property sold, and lost for future generations to enjoy. The Moneyist: I didn’t get my stimulus check because I owe back child support. It’s not fair. My stepchildren rely on me — what can I do? Kimberly Hanlon and Sommer Spector Angstman, co-founders of Lucere Legal in Minneapolis, Minn., advise caution. Quitclaims are non-revocable. They say a transfer on death deed is often preferable, and also prevents the parent being exposed to the folly of their children. “The relationship with the kids could go south and the kids could literally evict the parents because they are no longer owners of the home. Also, the kids’ creditors can put a lien on the house and foreclose, forcing the parents to pay off the lien or move,” they say. Remember that there are times, like a global public-health emergency, when vacation homes that once seemed tired, tiresome and inconvenient, suddenly appear as appealing as if they were made of candy and gingerbread, with gummy bears in the garden to welcome you home. Coronavirus update: As of Sunday, COVID-19 has now infected more than 25 million people worldwide, which mostly does not account for asymptomatic cases, and killed at least 842,892. The U.S. still has the world’s highest number of COVID-19 cases (5,961,582), followed by Brazil (3,846,153), India (3,542,733) and Russia (987,470), according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University.

    "text": "A contemporary-style, 14,262-square-foot home in Sun Valley, Idaho, has sold for $18 million, making it one of the most expensive sales ever in the popular ski resort area, listing agents said. The sale closed last Friday after entering into a contract in the beginning of the month, according to Travis Jones of Engel & Volkers, who handled the listing with his colleague Svea Grover. Engel & Volkers took over the listing two years ago. But the property has been on the market with a $20 million asking price since July 2015, Mr. Jones said. “For this price point, it takes a while for the right buyer to come along,” Mr. Jones said. “Because of the Covid-19 pandemic, what the property offers-including solitude, privacy, lots of open space-matched what the high-end buyer is looking for.” He declined to disclose the identity of the seller or the buyer. Mansion Global could not independently confirm their identities, as property records were not available online. The home was built in 2011 by the local architectural firm Ruscitto Latham Blanton with designs by Todd-Avery Lenahan, president and chief creative officer of Wynn Design, the design team for Wynn Resorts projects, according to Mr. Jones. “This house has a cool, contemporary style, different from other large homes in the Sun Valley, which are normally log style and have more of a mountain feelling,” he said. Further, while the house has eight intimate bedrooms with 11 bathrooms, it was very much designed to promote family living and gathering with big, common spaces, Mr. Jones added. Outdoors, the 3.03-acre property has a pool with a hot tub, a gazebo, an outdoor fireplace, and other entertaining spaces. The property is minutes away from the Bigwood River, hiking trails, Sun Valley Ski Resort and downtown Ketchum, which has high-quality culinary and cultural offerings.

    "text": "After a little more than a month on the market, celebrity power couple Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez have found a buyer for their beach house in the much coveted coastal California enclave of Malibu. The singer and actress and the former New York Yankees third baseman listed the three-story oceanfront home at the end of July for $7.99 million. The house was pending sale as of Tuesday, listing records show. Until the deal closes, a deed, and therefore information regarding a buyer and final sale price, will not be available. Spanning just over 4,400 square feet, the five-bedroom property has walls of glass doors, numerous terraces, and 50 feet of direct beachfront, according to the listing with Carl Gambino of Compass. The property maximizes the opportunity to entertain and “sets the stage for the opportunity to create an incredible beachfront oasis,” the listing said. Mr. Gambino did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The pair, who recently withdrew their bid to buy the New York Mets baseball team, bought the house in January 2019 for $6.6 million using a trust, records with PropertyShark show. They bought it from \"Entourage\" actor Jeremy Piven, according to The Wall Street Journal, who first reported on the home hitting the market. Around the time of the purchase, Ms. Lopez, 51, said in an interview on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” that Mr. Rodriguez, 45, had drafted Joanna Gaines, star of HGTV’s \"Fixer Upper,\" to help them redesign it, The Wall Street Journal said. The pair have been making some adjustments to their real estate portfolio of late, including the reported acquisition of a $32.5 million sprawling estate on Miami Beach’s uber exclusive and guard-gated Star Island, and Ms. Lopez’s purchase of an eco-friendly solar-powered bungalow in Los Angeles for $1.36 million. A representative for Ms. Lopez did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A representative for Mr. Rodriguez could not be reached for comment. COPYRIGHT © 2020 MANSION GLOBAL.

    "text": "University students seeking accommodation are the driving force behind a recent surge in rental demand in and around London, according to a report Tuesday from Knight Frank. During the week ending Aug. 22, the number of rental property viewings in London and the Home Counties—the counties surrounding the capital—hit a 10-year high, the estate agency and property consultant said, without specifying the exact level. “Part of the explanation is the unusual seasonal pattern of activity in 2020,” Tom Bill, head of residential research at Knight Frank, said in the report. “Students account for almost a quarter of the market and uncertainty around the start of the new academic year meant July was quieter than normal.” Instead, he said, some students held out until late August before beginning their searches. Only 4% of domestic students scheduled to begin university this year are currently planning to postpone their start date—the same proportion as last year—suggesting the coronavirus pandemic hasn’t majorly impacted the enthusiasm to attend institutions of higher education, according to a separate report from Knight Frank released in August. However the number of international students with a confirmed place to begin studying at U.K universities is down 5.5% on last year. Outside of the country’s student population, demand is being further bolstered by traditional tenants who have been taking advantage of falling rents, a result of a wealth of rental supply, according to the report. In the year to July, average rental values fell 5.8% in prime central London and declined 5.4% in prime outer London. In both cases, it was the largest annual decrease registered since 2009, during the global financial crisis, Knight Frank said. COPYRIGHT © 2020 MANSION GLOBAL.

    "text": "NEW YORK, Sept. 2, 2020 -- Consumer habits can take a lifetime to learn – but just a lockdown to lose. According to PwC's Global Entertainment & Media Outlook 2020–2024, the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated and amplified ongoing shifts in consumers' behaviour, pulling forward digital disruption and forging industry tipping points that wouldn't have been reached for many years. Digitalisation, one of the major forces shaping all industries, has been intensified by social distancing and mobility restrictions. As a result, the entertainment and media (E&M) world in 2020 has become more remote, more virtual, more streamed, more personal and – for now at least – more centred on the home than anyone anticipated at the start of the year. The pandemic afflicting the world brought the global E&M industry's growth to a shuddering halt. As a result, we delayed publication of the Outlook by three months so we could properly assess the pandemic's impacts. The revised projections for revenue growth underline why this was the right decision. Amid a global recession, 2020 will see the sharpest fall in global E&M revenue in the 21-year history of this research, with a decline of 5.6% from 2019 – more than US$120bn in absolute terms. In 2009, the last year the global economy shrank, total global E&M spending fell by just 3.0%. However, while the shockwaves from 2020 will continue to ripple through the global economy, our forecast shows the industry's fundamental growth trajectory remains strong. In recent years, as media experiences have become ever more central to our lives, global E&M growth has typically outpaced GDP. Just so, after the challenges of 2020, we expect E&M to reassume its outperformance. Our projections show that in 2021, E&M spending will grow by 6.4%. Looking across the five-year forecast period, from 2019 to 2024, we're forecasting overall revenue growth running at a 2.8% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). As is the case in the economy at large, the current pain in E&M is not evenly shared around the industry. It's most acute in segments that COVID-19 literally shut down, such as events: live music, cinema and trade shows. Spending on advertising likewise will fall by 13.4%. At the same time, the long-running transition in newspapers from print to digital has been fast-forwarded several years, cutting into papers' print revenues, for example. One result is that E&M segments are being transformed much earlier than was originally projected. Take cinema box office versus subscription video on demand (SVOD). As recently as 2015, box office revenue was three times SVOD. SVOD revenue will overtake box office in 2020 and is projected to surge away in the coming five years, reaching more than twice the size of box office in 2024. Or consider the amount of data consumed on smartphones versus on fixed broadband. Having taken a small lead in 2019, the smartphone is now set to pull away as the leading individual device used by consumers to access the Internet globally. So, how are the shifts accelerated by COVID-19 playing out in different industry segments? With people staying at home, over-the-top (OTT) video has seen global revenue surge by 26.0% in 2020. And it will keep rising strongly in the coming years, almost doubling in size from US$46.4bn in 2019 to US$86.8bn in 2024. The launch of the Disney+ streaming service in late 2019 could hardly have been better timed: having projected between 60mn and 90mn paying subscribers by 2024, Disney+ reached 60.5mn in early August 2020. Not surprisingly given the rise of streaming, global data consumption is another beneficiary of the digital acceleration powered by COVID-19. It will jump by 33.8% in 2020, and will more than double from 1.9 quadrillion megabytes (MB) in 2019 to 4.9 quadrillion MB in 2024. At the other end of the scale are the segments that have been hit hardest. With many cinemas closed and major movie releases delayed, we project that total global cinema revenues will plunge by almost 66% this year. And it's not likely that lost ground will be recovered; our forecast is that in 2024, cinema revenues for 2024 will be below their 2019 level. A further COVID-related impact is that the ongoing decline in global newspapers and consumer magazines has accelerated sharply in 2020, with overall revenues slumping by more than 14%, with consumer magazines suffering the most. That said, digital offers a silver lining: a tipping point for consumer magazines in 2023 will see their global revenue from digital advertising overtake that from print advertising. Other important sectors will struggle to claw back the growth they lost in 2019. For example, the global advertising sector – which will fall by 13.4% in 2020 to US$559.5bn – is not expected to return to its 2019 level until 2022. Yet – perhaps counterintuitively – some \"traditional\" media has held its own despite the effects of COVID-19 and digital acceleration. Amid reports of book sales booming during lockdowns, total global consumer books revenue is projected to continue its upward trajectory, rising at 1.4% compounded annually between 2019 and 2024 to reach US$64.7bn. Significantly, technology is playing an important role, with increasing use of smartphones and smart speakers boosting uptake of audiobooks, enabling consumers to listen on-the-go. Live physical events is another long-standing segment looking to adapt to the reality of an accelerated digital world. With concert halls, exhibition centres and stadiums closed for much of the year, some live events are using digital platforms to stay connected to their audiences. In the UK, London's Wireless Festival teamed up with tech outfit MelodyVR in mid-2020 to deliver recorded virtual reality performances from artists such as Cardi B, Travis Scott, and Migos. More than 130,000 people from 34 countries attended virtually. Although 2020 has been a challenging and disruptive year for most industries – including many segments of E&M – it is clear that consumer demand for the varied and expanding array of media choices now on offer continues to grow. The revenue figures in this year's Outlook reflect the full force of the economic downturns and digital acceleration triggered by COVID-19, but the longer-term outlook for the E&M industry as a whole remains bright. That said, it's also clear that as normality slowly returns, there will continue to be winners and losers. Werner Ballhaus, Global Entertainment & Media Industry Leader at PwC, comments: \"It's clear that COVID-19 has accelerated consumers' transition to digital consumption and triggered disruptive change – both positive and negative – across many forms of media. Yet it's equally evident that the E&M industry's underlying strengths and appeal to consumers remain as strong as ever. While there will still be challenges for E&M companies as we move beyond the pandemic, the digital migration that it has pulled forward will also generate opportunities in all segments – not only those that have benefited from its impacts to date.\" To request press access to the online Global Entertainment & Media Outlook 2020–2024 content, contact Ashley Worley at [email protected].

    "text": "ATLANTA, Sept. 1, 2020 -- SoftWave® Tissue Regeneration Technologies, a disruptive bio-medical device company, was cleared by the FDA on Friday, Aug. 28, 2020, for the treatment of superficial, partial-thickness, second-degree burns in adults (FDA 510k letter number K200926). SoftWave® also has clearance for the treatment of Diabetic Foot Ulcers (DFU's), making it the only ESWT company to have two clearances for both acute (burns) and chronic wounds (DFU's). SoftWave® therapy gives physicians, who treat burn patients, another option in healing burn wounds. Each year, in the United States, approximately 450,000 patients receive medical attention, at emergency rooms, for burn related injuries. Most superficial wounds heal in two weeks; however, patients who suffer severe burns must endure intense physical and psychological pain during the burn injury treatment phase. There are over 3,400 burn injury deaths, including 1,100 children every year. The CDC estimates that $7.5 billion dollars are spent each year for burn related injuries. After the treatment phase is over and wounds are healed, scarring and disfigurement may interfere with movement, mobility, and daily life functions, resulting in a lifetime of physical and emotional burdens. Each year, in the United States, approximately 450,000 patients receive medical attention, at emergency rooms, for burn related injuries. Most superficial wounds heal in two weeks; however, patients who suffer severe burns must endure intense physical and psychological pain during the burn injury treatment phase. There are over 3,400 burn injury deaths, including 1,100 children every year. The CDC estimates that $7.5 billion dollars are spent each year for burn related injuries. After the treatment phase is over and wounds are healed, scarring and disfigurement may interfere with movement, mobility, and daily life functions, resulting in a lifetime of physical and emotional burdens. SoftWave®'s technology uses an unfocused extracorporeal shock wave (uESWT) to promote both a physical and biological response in order to improve wound healing. In a prospective randomized trial conducted by Dr. Christian Ottomann, published in the Annals of Surgery, significant accelerated epithelialization was demonstrated in the patients who had undergone uESWT (9.6 ± 1.7 days) as compared to the patients who did not undergo uESWT (12.5 ± 2.2 days); a statistically significant reduction in the days required for healing (±3). This change is a substantial factor for any burn patient. The SoftWave® biological response for wound healing is associated with neovascularization, and an increase in oxygenation and perfusion, ultimately resulting in angiogenesis. The hypothesized mechanisms of action for accelerated wound healing include stem cell activation and recruitment, and a reduction in the inflammation as proven in our published TLR3 model. SoftWave® TRT is a bio-medical device company that has proprietary patented technology, using unfocused acoustic waves, to treat a variety of conditions. The OrthoGold® was first cleared in 2018 for the activation of connective tissue and registered for pain reduction and increased blood flow. Our second clearance, in 2019, was for the treatment of Diabetic Foot Ulcers. SoftWave® TRT has over thirty patents for a variety of indications, including the following: stem cell activation, cellulite reduction, numerous indications involving the heart, and wound healing. SoftWave® TRT plans to pursue FDA clearance, for all ESWT therapies, targeted by other publicly traded shockwave companies including Sanuwave (SNWV), Soliton (SOLY) and Shockwave Medical (SWAV). SoftWave® believes our patented \"softwaves\" have superior benefits compared to traditional ESWT, and we are conducting multiple clinical trials to demonstrate the effectiveness over current available therapies. orthogold-100.jpg OrthoGold 100 https://www.trtllc.com"

Also, this segment was the early adopter of the geotechnical instrumentation and monitoring techniques; therefore, it is likely to continue to lead the GTIM market in the coming years. Americas projected to hold the largest share of the GTIM market in 2025. The GTIM market in the Americas is expected to grow at a significant rate owing to an increase in investments in infrastructural projects in the region. For instance, from 2009 to 2017, the US federal government and local government spent about USD 440 billion on infrastructure. In addition, countries such as the US and Canada are increasingly adopting geotechnical instrumentation and monitoring tools to ensure the safety and security of structures and their people. Additionally, in the Americas, both government and private sectors are aggressively involved in large-scale infrastructure projects. For example, the Nevada Department of Transportation (NDOT) has constructed a 4-lane concrete interstate freeway between Silverline Road and Foothill Drive in Henderson. The government spent USD 83 million in this project. This is one of the many projects in the region. Such new infrastructure projects would upsurge the demand for geotechnical instrumentation and monitoring tools. Therefore, the rapid development of new infrastructures in the Americas is one of the major driving factors for the market growth in this region. 3 Executive Summary4 Premium Insights4.1 Attractive

    "text": "LAVAL, QC, Sept. 1, 2020 - For its first quarter ended July 19, 2020, Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc. (\"Couche-Tard\" or the \"Corporation\") (TSX: ATD.A) (TSX: ATD.B) announces net earnings attributable to shareholders of the Corporation of $777.1 million, representing $0.70 per share on a diluted basis. The results for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 were affected by a pre-tax net foreign exchange loss of $18.4 million, as well as pre-tax acquisition costs of $3.9 million. The results for the comparable quarter of fiscal 2020 were affected by a pre-tax net foreign exchange loss of $6.5 million, an income tax expense of $4.5 million (of which $3.5 million is attributable to shareholders of the Corporation) following the first tranche of the December 2018 asset exchange agreement with CAPL, as well as pre-tax acquisition costs of $0.2 million. Excluding these items, the adjusted net earnings were approximately $795.0 million1 or $0.711 per share on a diluted basis for the first quarter of fiscal 2021, compared with $548.0 million1 or $0.481 per share on a diluted basis for the first quarter of fiscal 2020, an increase of 47.9% in the adjusted net earnings per share on a diluted basis, driven by strong growth in merchandise and service and in road transportation fuel gross profit, as well as by good cost control. All financial information presented is in US dollars unless stated otherwise. \"We had an exceptional first quarter, both financially and operationally, as we have seen an increase in shopping occasions and solid execution by our teams to take advantage of the changing consumer behaviors, this led to very strong same-store merchandise sales of 7.7% in the U.S., 19.9% in Canada, and 3.4% in Europe. This growth was due to the gradual reopening of the economies, and to continued strength in the average basket size driven by customer trip consolidation as customers relied more on the proximity and ease of shopping in our locations. Fuel margins remained healthy across the network, and fuel volumes have shown steady improvement since dropping to their low point in spring, especially in Europe where societies have returned to more normal behaviors,\" said Brian Hannasch, President and CEO of Alimentation Couche-Tard. \"This quarter, we pushed forward our Fresh Food, Fast program in the U.S., where we now have nearly 875 locations up and running, and are moving towards our goal of 1,500 stores this fall. The ease of preparation and notable quality of our products are leading to high customer satisfaction and to increased sales compared to our benchmark non-food stores. We also advanced in our innovation journey with the continued piloting and roll-out of frictionless options for delivery and payment, as well as with our dynamic pricing capabilities both at the fuel pumps and in our stores,\" concluded Brian Hannasch. Claude Tessier, Chief Financial Officer said, \"We delivered another solid quarter in the face of a challenging and unprecedented macroeconomic environment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our first quarter performance once again demonstrated the resilience of our agile business model, both from a financial and an operational standpoint. Throughout the quarter, we remained focused on maximizing cash flows, by containing costs and reducing non-critical capital expenditures to best navigate the turbulence and emerge from the crisis in a position of strength. I am especially proud of our teams' execution, as we generated record free cash flow and exited the quarter with a healthy leverage ratio and liquidity of nearly $5.8 billion through our available cash and undrawn operating credit facility. We stand ready to invest once again in our operations in support of our five-year growth plan, as the various economies in which we operate gradually ramp-up.\" Please refer to the section \"Net earnings attributable to shareholders of the Corporation (\"net earnings\") and adjusted net earnings attributable to shareholders of the Corporation (\"adjusted net earnings\")\" of this press release for additional information on this performance measure.

We believe this measure is useful to investors and analysts. Our revenues were $9.7 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2021, down by $4.5 billion, a decrease of 31.4% compared with the corresponding quarter of fiscal 2020. This performance is mainly attributable to the negative impact of COVID-19 on fuel demand, to a lower average road transportation fuel selling price and to the disposal of our interests in CAPL which had an impact of approximately $487.0 million, as well as to the net negative impact from the translation of revenues of our Canadian and European operations into US dollars, which had an impact of approximately $165.0 million. Total merchandise and service revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 were $3.9 billion, an increase of $252.0 million compared with the corresponding quarter of fiscal 2020. Excluding CAPL's revenues, as well as the net negative impact from the translation of our Canadian and European operations into US dollars, merchandise and service revenues increased by approximately $304.0 million or 8.5%. This increase is primarily attributable to growth in basket size, which more than offset continued softness in traffic. We saw strength across many categories, especially tobacco products, alcohol, packaged beverages and various grocery items. Same-store merchandise revenues increased by 7.7% in the United States, by 3.4% in Europe, and by 19.9% in Canada. Total road transportation fuel revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 were $5.8 billion, a decrease of $4.6 billion compared with the corresponding quarter of fiscal 2020. Excluding CAPL's revenues, as well as the net negative impact from the translation of revenues of our Canadian and European operations into US dollars, road transportation fuel revenues decreased by approximately $4.0 billion or 40.6%. This decrease is mostly attributable to the decrease on fuel demand in relation with the stay-at-home measures implemented due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as to a lower average road transportation fuel selling price which had a negative impact of approximately $1.8 billion. Same-store road transportation fuel volume decreased in the United States by 21.2%, in Europe by 12.4%, and in Canada by 25.6%. 2.55 2.51 2.21 2.04 2.36 70.86 73.92 60.95 56.89 66.83 105.14 103.47 88.78 86.89 97.79 2.72 2.42 2.51 2.66 2.57 80.56 75.28 74.59 77.35 76.86 115.22 97.59 103.45 111.16 106.23 Total other revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 were $86.6 million, a decrease of $101.9 million compared with the corresponding quarter of fiscal 2020. Excluding CAPL's revenues, as well as the net negative impact from the translation of our Canadian and European operations into US dollars, other revenues decreased by approximately $75.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, mainly driven by lower aviation fuel revenues, which had a minimal impact on gross profit. Our gross profit was $2.5 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2021, up by $202.0 million, or 8.7% compared with the corresponding quarter of fiscal 2020, mainly attributable to higher road transportation fuel gross margins and organic growth, partly offset by the negative impact of COVID-19 on fuel demand, by the disposal of our interests in CAPL, which had an impact of approximately $49.0 million, and by the net negative impact from the translation of our Canadian and European operations into US dollars, which had an impact of approximately $27.0 million. In the first quarter of fiscal 2021, our merchandise and service gross profit was $1.3 billion, an increase of $93.0 million compared with the corresponding quarter of fiscal 2020. Excluding CAPL's gross profit, as well as the net negative impact from the translation of our Canadian and European operations into US dollars, merchandise and service gross profit increased by approximately $109.0 million or 8.8%, mainly attributable to strong organic growth, despite lower traffic in our network due to COVID-19. Our gross margin increased by 0.7% in the United States to 34.7%, mainly due to strong service revenues, and to an accelerated recognition of deferred credits. Excluding this accelerated recognition, our gross margin would have been stable compared to the corresponding quarter of last year. In Europe and in Canada, the gross margin decreased by 0.9% to 40.6%, and by 1.2% to 31.7%, respectively, both negatively impacted by a shift in product mix towards lower margin categories. In the first quarter of fiscal 2021, our road transportation fuel gross profit was $1.1 billion, an increase of $131.4 million compared with the corresponding quarter of fiscal 2020. Excluding CAPL's gross profit, as well as the net negative impact from the translation of our Canadian and European operations into US dollars, our first quarter road transportation fuel gross profit increased by approximately $168.0 million or 17.2%. Our road transportation fuel gross margin was strong at 42.99¢ per gallon in the United States, an increase of 16.13¢ per gallon, mainly driven by a decline in fuel products costs. In Europe, road transportation fuel margin was US 10.51¢ per liter, an increase of US 2.07¢ per liter, and in Canada, it was CA 10.29¢ per liter, an increase of CA 2.89¢ per liter, driven by changes in the competitive landscape and improved supply conditions. 28.29 27.04 46.88 42.99 34.72 4.63 4.54 4.97 4.88 4.72 23.66 22.50 41.91 38.11 30.00 21.88 29.42 18.51 26.86 24.53 4.55 4.31 4.40 4.70 4.48 17.33 25.11 14.11 22.16 20.05 Generally, during normal economic cycles, road transportation fuel margins in the United States can be volatile from one quarter to another but have historically trended higher over longer periods. The historical trends for Europe and Canada are similar, while the margin volatility and expenses related to electronic payment modes are not as significant. In the first quarter of fiscal 2021, other revenues gross profit was $42.3 million, a decrease of $22.4 million compared with the corresponding quarter of fiscal 2020. Excluding CAPL's gross profit, as well as the net negative impact from the translation of our Canadian and European operations into US dollars, other revenues gross profit increased by approximately $1.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. For the first quarter of fiscal 2021, expenses decreased by 5.6%, compared with the corresponding quarter of fiscal 2020. If we exclude certain items that are not considered indicative of future trends, expenses decreased by 0.3%. (5.6%) 2.4% 1.6% 1.2% 0.6% (0.3%) (0.2%) (0.3%) Decrease in expenses was driven by, amongst other items, cost and labor efficiencies, as well as by various measures enacted to streamline and minimize our controllable expenses. These items were partly offset by COVID-19 related expenses, normal inflation, higher labor costs from minimum wage increases in certain regions and incremental investments in our stores to support our strategic initiatives. COVID-19 related expenses include, but are not limited to, an emergency appreciation pay premium of $2.50 per hour in North America for hourly store employees and distribution center employees, Thank you bonuses in North America following the end of the appreciation pay premium, additional cleaning and sanitizing supplies, as well as masks and gloves for our employees. We continue to rigorously focus on controlling costs throughout our organization, while ensuring we maintain the quality of service we offer to our customers. During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, EBITDA increased from $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion, an increase of 27.4% compared with the same quarter last year. Excluding the specific items shown in the table below, the adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 increased by $320.4 million or 30.8% compared with the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year, mainly from higher road transportation fuel gross margins and organic growth, partly offset by the negative impact of COVID-19 on our traffic, as well as from the net negative impact from the translation of our Canadian and European operations into US dollars. The variation in exchange rates had a net negative impact of approximately $12.0 million. It should be noted that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not performance measures defined by IFRS, but we, as well as investors and analysts, consider that those performance measures facilitate the evaluation of our ongoing operations and our ability to generate cash flows to fund our cash requirements, including our capital expenditures program and payment of dividends. Note that our definition of these measures may differ from the one used by other public corporations. 777.1 536.0 202.7 135.3 88.0 87.0 289.5 307.1 1,357.3 1,065.4 3.9 0.2 (24.8) 1,361.2 1,040.8 For the first quarter of fiscal 2021, our depreciation expense decreased by $17.6 million. Excluding CAPL's results, as well as the net positive impact from the translation of our Canadian and European operations into US dollars, the depreciation expense increased by approximately $10.0 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. This increase is mainly driven by the replacement of equipment and the ongoing improvement of our network. Net financial expenses for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 were $88.0 million, an increase of $1.0 million compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Excluding the items shown in the table below, net financial expenses increased by $0.4 million. 88.0 87.0 (18.4) (6.5) (11.3) 69.6 69.2 The income tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 was 20.7% compared with 20.2% for the corresponding quarter of fiscal 2020. The income tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 includes an income tax expense of $4.5 million from the re-evaluation of the deferred tax assets and liabilities following the first tranche of the December 2018 asset exchange agreement with CAPL. The increase in the income tax rate, excluding the item shown in the table below, is stemming from the impact of a different mix in our earnings across the various jurisdictions in which we operate. 20.7% 20.2% (0.7)% 20.7% 19.5% Net earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 were $777.1 million, compared with $538.8 million for the first quarter of the previous fiscal year, an increase of $238.3 million or 44.2%. Diluted net earnings per share stood at $0.70, compared with $0.48 for the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal year. The translation of revenues and expenses from our Canadian and European operations into US dollars had a net negative impact of approximately $8.0 million on net earnings of the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Excluding the items shown in the table below from net earnings of the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, adjusted net earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 were approximately $795.0 million, compared with $548.0 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2020, an increase of $247.0 million or 45.1%. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $0.71 for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 compared with $0.48 for the corresponding period of fiscal 2020, an increase of 47.9%. 777.1 538.8 18.4 6.5 3.9 0.2 3.5 (4.4) (1.0) 795.0 548.0 It should be noted that adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted net earnings are not performance measures defined by IFRS, but we, as well as investors and analysts, consider these measures useful for evaluating the underlying performance of our operations on a comparable basis. Note that our definition of these measures may differ from the one used by other public corporations. During its September 1, 2020 meeting, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of CA 7.0¢ per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 to shareholders on record as at September 11, 2020, and approved its payment for September 25, 2020. This is an eligible dividend within the meaning of the Income Tax Act (Canada). Couche-Tard is the leader in the Canadian convenience store industry.

    "text": "REYKJAVIK, Iceland, Sept. 1, 2020 -- Scientists at deCODE genetics in Iceland, a subsidiary of Amgen Inc , biopharmaceutical company headquartered in California, and their collaborators, today publish a study in The New England Journal of Medicine, that shows that antiviral antibodies against SARS-CoV2 do not decline within four months of diagnosis. The aim of the study was to obtain understanding of the nature and durability of the humoral immune response to infection by SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. To that end the scientists measured antibodies in the sera of 30,576 persons in Iceland (8.4% of the nation) using six assays (two of them pan-Ig) and determined that the best measure of seropositivity was a positive result with both pan-Ig assays. They tested 2.102 samples from 1,237 qPCR-positive persons obtained up to 4 months from diagnosis. They also measured antibodies in 4,222 samples from exposed, quarantined persons and 19000 persons not known to have been exposed. Of quarantined persons, 2.3% were seropositive and of those with unknown exposure, 0.3% were positive. The scientists estimate that 0.9% of Icelanders were infected by SARS-CoV-2 and 44% of people infected with SARS-CoV2 in Iceland were not diagnosed with qPCR. The infection fatality rate is 0.3%.  Of the 1,797 persons who recovered from SARS-CoV-2  in Iceland, 1,107 (91.1%) were seropositive. \"We are pleased to be able to put to rest the concern that the titer of the antiviral antibodies may decline within weeks of infection, says Kari Stefansson, CEO of deCODE genetics and senior author on the paper. Furthermore it is clear that 99,1% of Icelanders are still vulnerable to SARS-CoV2. We are now focused on studying cell mediated immunity in those who do not raise antibodies.\" Based in Reykjavik, Iceland, deCODE is a global leader in analyzing and understanding the human genome. Using its unique expertise in human genetics combined with growing expertise in transcriptomics and population proteomics and vast amount of phenotypic data, deCODE has discovered risk factors for dozens of common diseases and provided key insights into their pathogenesis. The purpose of understanding the genetics of disease is to use that information to create new means of diagnosing, treating and preventing disease. deCODE is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN).

    "text": "WILMINGTON, Del., Sept. 1, 2020 -- The Intercollegiate Studies Institute's Board of Trustees announced that John A. Burtka IV has been appointed as ISI's new President. ISI Chairman of the Board Thomas Lynch said: \"Johnny Burtka is a proven leader in the conservative intellectual movement. An ISI alumnus and a Hillsdale College graduate, Johnny has been a tireless advocate for the people and ideas that ISI holds dear. I have every confidence that Johnny will be an outstanding leader of ISI, and the entire Board looks forward to working alongside him.\" Burtka returns to ISI after four years at The American Conservative magazine, where he served as Executive Director and Acting Editor. He graduated from Hillsdale College with degrees in French and Christian Studies and earned a graduate degree in theology from La Faculté Jean Calvin in Aix-en-Provence, France. He was a Lincoln Fellow at the Claremont Institute in 2018. He has appeared on Fox News and Fox Business and written for the Washington Post, the Richmond Times-Dispatch, First Things, the American Mind, and the Intercollegiate Review, among others. Previously, he participated in academic fellowships at Washington College and the Trinity Forum. Burtka succeeds Charlie Copeland, who became President of ISI in November 2016. \"Charlie leaves ISI after nearly a decade of service to ISI as a Board member and most recently as President,\" Lynch said. \"The Board is thankful for all his contributions in support of ISI's mission to advance the principles and virtues of a free society.\" Johnny Burtka said: \"I am honored by the opportunity to become the eighth President in ISI's 67-year history. Simply put, ISI is the Oxford of American conservatism. It's the place where conservative students, alumni, and thought leaders go to do their thinking about the most pressing challenges of the day. As cancel culture and identity politics consume mainstream discourse on campuses and in the media, ISI keeps the flame of memory alive in a revolutionary age. By educating students in the principles of ordered liberty, ISI is ensuring that future generations of American leaders embody the best traditions of Western thought and culture. I couldn't be more thrilled to help build on the important work that the ISI team is doing to defend American institutions and ideals.\" Burtka will become ISI's President on September 21. Too many college students feel isolated or attacked for questioning the ever-narrowing range of debate on campus. ISI introduces them to the American tradition of liberty and to a vibrant community of students and scholars. ISI students get an education and a community they don't find at their universities. And in the process they become articulate voices for the principles that made America free and prosperous. ISI is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. For more information, visit isi.org.

    "url": "https://www.prnewswire.com//news-releases/tonkean-launches-changemakers-matching-experts-with-nonprofits-to-solve-operations-challenges-301122399.html",
    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 1, 2020 -- Tonkean, the operating system for business operations, today announced \"Changemakers\", a week-long hackathon-style event to connect non-profit organizations with volunteer experts from top tech companies, to help overcome operational challenges and run more smoothly and efficiently. Today's businesses face operational and technical roadblocks that inhibit them from scaling fast, and lower their ability to make a more meaningful impact on the communities they care for. At large enterprises, these inefficiencies are increasingly mitigated via major investments in process automation software and hiring top tech talent, luxuries that nonprofits and small businesses don't usually have access to. The goal of the Changemakers project is to level that operational playing field. Today's businesses face operational and technical roadblocks that inhibit them from scaling fast, and lower their ability to make a more meaningful impact on the communities they care for. At large enterprises, these inefficiencies are increasingly mitigated via major investments in process automation software and hiring top tech talent, luxuries that nonprofits and small businesses don't usually have access to. The goal of the Changemakers project is to level that operational playing field. In late October, nonprofits who sign up for the project will be paired with one or more business operations experts for a full week of service to improve the nonprofit's operational efficiency. Through Tonkean's close partnership with the AdaptivOps Community, which has brought together hundreds of the world's top operations and IT professionals to share ops knowledge, the Changemakers project will deliver hands-on advice from experts in IT, HR operations, sales operations, legal operations, financial operations and more. Each ops professional will be matched with a nonprofit based on their specific expertise and the organization's operational needs, and will be provided access to Tonkean's business operations platform to orchestrate their processes. Starting today, professionals from the operations and IT communities can register to volunteer their time in late October, while nonprofits can sign up if they seek free operational support. Signups are officially open at the Changemakers project site, tonkean.com/changemakers \"We've realized through our work with several non-profit organizations that there's no shortage of passion and desire to make a difference for their causes,\" said Sagi Eliyahu, CEO and Co-Founder of Tonkean. \"What's often missing is the technical structure and operational processes to get these organizations functioning as efficiently as possible. When you join a non-profit, you don't do it because you love mundane data entry or project coordination, you do it because you want to change the world. We hope the Changemakers project will make that more achievable.\" Today, Tonkean helps many of the Forbes 100 solve their operational challenges, improving critical metrics like revenue velocity, customer retention, and more. Specific processes range from legal intake to customer support triage, IT ticketing to new-hire onboarding and more. Tonkean's Adaptive Business Operations platform has proven valuable for business operations teams of all categories and has previously been made available to qualified nonprofits free of charge. The Tonkean platform will continue to be offered at no cost to these organizations to use throughout the Changemakers event and beyond. In the spring of 2020, Shopping Angels, a service that enlists volunteers to personally deliver groceries and other essentials to those who prefer to stay home, was founded in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic. By using Tonkean, they were able to quickly orchestrate the process of taking in requests and routing them to the appropriate volunteers around the country. Ben Wallace, a volunteer coordinator for Shopping Angels, saw the impact of Tonkean as a game-changer for their ability to scale, and subsequently joined Tonkean as a solutions engineer. \"At an organization like Shopping Angels, you want to use any donations and resources for achieving the core goal of getting groceries in the hands of high-risk individuals. So you don't want to invest time and energy copying and pasting email templates, looking up addresses, and manually checking for changes,\" said Wallace. \"That's why it was so immensely valuable to have Tonkean's assistance in refining our processes at Shopping Angels – it took the process of connecting shoppers with customers from a manual slog to a well-oiled machine in all 50 states overnight.\" To register as either a non-profit or an operations expert, or to learn more about Changemakers, visit tonkean.com/changemakers Tonkean is the operating system for business operations.

    "text": "CHARLOTTE, N.C., Sept. 1, 2020 -- To expand their extensive list of rapid prototyping services, Signicast, a Form Technologies Company, has signed a partnership with DDM to offer the convenience and speed of ceramic 3D printing with the precision of investment casting. In recent years, Signicast has been expanding its prototyping services to meet the needs and demands of their growing customers. From rapid in-house tooling and CNC machining, direct metal laser sintering, and PMMA and SLA patterns for design validation, Signicast knows that when looking for a fully functional prototype, their customers don't want to sacrifice quality for time or cost. That's why Signicast and DDM moved to form a strategic partnership, to deliver the high-quality prototypes customers have come to expect from Signicast, faster. DDM's LAMP™ Large Area Maskless Photopolymerization ceramic 3D printing technology brings advanced capabilities—including topology optimization and generative designs—for achieving complex components with the convenience and shorter lead times of 3D printing. Partnered with Signicast's wide selection of material options, state-of-the-art automation technology, and design for manufacturability expertise, customers can expect to receive high-quality prototypes to validate their component designs in a fraction of the conventional time. These complementary processes give engineers greater design freedom for their components.

By taking advantage of 3D printing technology to optimize the shape of the design to cut down on surface area, designers are no longer limited by tooling configuration capability. This technology enables Signicast and DDM customers to create more ergonomic components with less material cost and shorter lead times. \"DDM is extremely proud to join hands with Signicast to modernize investment casting while offering speed, complexity and value to customers. This partnership greatly accelerates the introduction of DDM's ceramic 3D printing based Digital Foundry™ offering to the market,\" said Dr. Suman Das, Founder and CEO of DDM.

(\"Genius Brands\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: GNUS) who purchased or otherwise acquired Genius Brands securities between March 17, 2020 and July 5, 2020, both dates inclusive (the \"Class Period\").

If  you  have  incurred  losses  in  the  shares  of Genius Brands International, Inc., you may, no later than October 19, 2020, request that the Court appoint you lead plaintiff of the proposed class. The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading and/or failed to disclose that material adverse regarding the launch of the Kartoon Channel! app. The lawsuit continues to allege that Genius Brands made false and misleading statements about Nickelodeon's claimed broadcast expansion of Genius Brands' Rainbow Rangers cartoon, as well as its growth potential and overall prospects as a company. On June 5, 2020, Hindenburg Research published a report entitled \"A Bagholder's Guide to Why We Think Genius Brands Will Be a $1.50 Stock Within a Month\" (the \"Hindenburg Report\").  The Hindenburg Report questioned the Company's actual value, noting that contrary to Genius's representations, the Company's highly-touted cartoon property \"Rainbow Rangers\" was airing only nine times per week, rather than 26 times as Genius had previously represented, and at unfavorable time slots. On July 2, 2020, Genius issued a press release touting the announcement of a purported \"Key Business Development\" on July 6, 2020.  However, the July 6, 2020 announcement merely touted the creation of a joint venture with POW!  Entertainment   regarding intellectual property that was created by Stan Lee after his tenure at Marvel Entertainment. On this underwhelming news, Genius's stock price fell $0.89 per share, or 25.07%, to close at $2.66 per share on July 6, 2020.

    "title": "New Mountain Vantage Releases Investor Presentation Highlighting Urgent Need for Changes to Virtusa Corporation's Board of Directors",
    "url": "https://www.prnewswire.com//news-releases/new-mountain-vantage-releases-investor-presentation-highlighting-urgent-need-for-changes-to-virtusa-corporations-board-of-directors-301122418.html",
    "text": "Full Presentation Can Be Accessed and Downloaded at ImproveVirtusa.com NEW YORK, Sept. 1, 2020 -- New Mountain Vantage Advisers, L.L.C. (\"NMV\"), which manages funds that hold a collective economic ownership interest in Virtusa Corporation (\"Virtusa\" or the \"Company\") equivalent to approximately 10.8% of the Company's outstanding common stock, today released an investor presentation that can be accessed at ImproveVirtusa.com. In the presentation, NMV highlights the need for immediate Board change at Virtusa to drive long overdue corporate governance reform and management accountability which we believe are key to unlocking significant value for all stockholders. Tellingly, throughout NMV's months-long engagement with Management and the Board, including during this proxy contest, Virtusa has yet to disagree with our assessment of the Company. Instead, the Board essentially believes it \"has it covered\" through its \"newly-announced\" Three Pillar Strategy, which is simply a repackaged version of its prior unfulfilled promises. Rather than providing stockholders with a detailed, actionable plan and timeline that the Company intends to implement, which would right the ship at this promising company, the Board is basing its platform to shareholders on the false assertion that NMV \"reneged\" on a settlement agreement. Let us set the record straight – NMV has never reneged on any agreement with the Company. We have been steadfast in insisting that real change is needed on this Board, and that real change must include an NMV representative on the Board and an Independent Director not handpicked by the Company. The presentation released today outlines the compelling and urgent need for change at Virtusa and why NMV and its highly-qualified nominees, Prasad Chintamaneni and Patty Morrison, are the right people to finally drive the entire Board to hold Management accountable and execute on a real plan to drive long-term shareholder value at Virtusa. We have highlighted below just a few of the points included in the materials released today, and strongly encourage all stockholders to read the presentation in full.  We believe that only one conclusion can be drawn from our detailed analysis — the status quo cannot continue, and Virtusa's entrenched Board and Management team cannot be trusted to execute on the same promises that they have failed to realize for the past several years. We implore you to vote your shares on the BLUE proxy card in favor of both Prasad Chintamaneni and Patty Morrison, two high-qualified Directors who will act in the best interests of all stockholders. 1.     Numbers Speak for Themselves Virtusa's share price has declined by -35% in the five-year period ending June 18, 2020, compared to a return of +57% for the Russell 3000 in the same period and +38% for Virtusa's Direct Peers3. This performance was the result of essentially no measurable progress toward improving worst-in-class margins that are nearly ~50% below the relevant IT Services peer group average, revenue concentration issues that are worse today versus five years ago, and poor capital allocation decisions with Virtusa's return on invested capital4, which has contracted from ~16% in the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2015 (before the consummation of the Polaris transaction) to ~10% in FY2020, despite the Company spending ~$650mm on M&A in the past five years. 2.     Years of Unfulfilled Promises What has the Board done in response to this poor performance? It has repackaged the areas it has purportedly focused on for years — margin improvement, revenue diversification and profitable revenue growth — into a \"new\" Three Pillar Strategy.  While there is no disagreement that these are key focus areas for the Company, these are the very same items that Management and the Board have failed to execute on for years. So, how is this Three Pillar Strategy really \"new\"? Despite its promises, Virtusa has failed to increase margins, diversify revenue, or grow profitably in the past five years.  The question for you, our fellow stockholders, is simple: does the current Board have the ability to, once and for all, drive the change necessary for Virtusa to fulfill its promises to investors? Based on historical performance, the clear answer is no. It is time for real change agents in the form of the NMV nominees! 3.     Virtusa's Brand of Corporate Governance We are firm believers that strong corporate governance and independence of the Board from Management are the keys to driving Management accountability, which in turn drives operational performance and value creation. It is not surprising that the Board has failed to hold Management accountable and drive stockholder value, as the Board itself is not accountable to stockholders – Virtusa has a staggered Board of Directors with a long history of interlocking personal relationships, and does not allow stockholders to act by written consent or call a special meeting. The lack of accountability continues with a combined Chairman and CEO and an under-representation of female Directors on the Board, which only ensures that a diversity of opinion is foreclosed from the Boardroom. While Virtusa's historical corporate governance practices, unfulfilled promises and bottom quartile total shareholder return performance over the past five years5 is a more than sufficient case for significant Boardroom change, the recent actions of the Board should sound alarm bells for all stockholders.  In the face of this proxy contest, the Board shrunk the number of Directors up for election from three to two, added a handpicked Director that will not be up for re-election until 2022, and chose to utilize a Director age limitation policy that it never previously disclosed or enforced (including against director William O'Brien, whom the described policy should have applied to in his previous election in 2017.) In response to these actions, NMV publicly called on the Board to provide an explanation to stockholders, including by releasing the age limitation policy and explaining why it was never previously enforced or disclosed. The public response from the Company on these matters? Absolutely nothing.  We privately requested this information from the Company and the response was similar – the Company refused to provide us any information on these subjects beyond a copy of the policy and select Board minutes and, even then, the Company told us we could only receive this limited material if we agreed not to tell our fellow stockholders what they say, which is obviously not acceptable given this information is supposed to be public in the first place. Unlike the Board, NMV wants to do what is right for all shareholders. So, we again ask a simple question: what is the Board looking to hide? Fellow shareholders, if you share our concerns, we urge you to call the Company and demand that it answers these questions publicly. 4.     Flawed Management Compensation Simply put, the compensation structure of the Company is flawed. Revenue and profitability targets are not linked in any way, resulting in significant payments to Management for underperforming on profit targets but meeting revenue targets. The target adjusted operating margin percentage for 100% payout in FY2020 was below levels seen in FY2016, such that Management is essentially being paid to regain margin it lost in the past. Management has no yardstick for return on invested capital (such as Adj. EPS) that factors in cost of capital for its actions, which has directly resulted in value-destructive capital allocation.  In fact, the CEO's compensation has grown by 86% from FY2016 to FY2020 versus total Adj. EPS growth of only 4% over the same period, while stockholders have seen the share price decline by 35% in the five-year period ended June 18, 2020. So, all of this begs an obvious question – who is responsible for overseeing such a flawed program? The answer is the two Virtusa Directors up for election at the upcoming annual meeting, who are both members of the Board's Compensation Committee.  It is time to send a message – vote these individuals off the Board and let this be the first step in a new era of accountability at Virtusa! We strongly encourage shareholders to act now and vote your shares on the BLUE proxy card in favor of both Prasad Chintamaneni and Patty Morrison. This will send a strong message to the Company to improve its shareholder returns, governance and management accountability. The Company has underperformed again and again, and shareholders must act to refresh the Board to put Virtusa on a better course. We urge you to express your views directly to Management and the Board. Every shareholder has a voice, and it is only through using that voice that we can tell the current Board: It Is Time to Usher in an Era of Accountability in the Virtusa Boardroom!

The Fund's net asset value will vary and its distribution rate may vary and both may be affected by numerous factors, including changes in the market spread over a specified benchmark, market interest rates and performance of the broader equity markets.

    "text": "EASTON, Md., Sept. 1, 2020 -- Shore Bancshares, Inc. (\"the Company\") (NASDAQ:SHBI) announced today that its Board of Directors has reinstated its common stock repurchase program, which had been previously placed on hold by management due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic disruption that ensued. Under the repurchase program, management is authorized to repurchase up to $10.0 million, or approximately 5%, of the total outstanding shares of the Company's common stock. As of August 31, 2020, the Company had purchased 278,700 of its common shares under the stock repurchase program. The Company has approximately $5.5 million remaining of the total authorized $10.0 million to repurchase additional shares of the Company's common stock. As of August 31, 2020, the Company had 12,526,708 shares of common stock outstanding. The program may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice.  The program will expire on December 31, 2020. Lloyd L. \"Scott\" Beatty, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer stated, \"We are pleased to resume our stock repurchase program as we continue to maintain strong capital levels, minimal credit losses and solid operating results. The recently completed $25.0 million subordinated notes offering only enhances the Company's already strong capital position which provides for flexibility to repurchase shares while providing an insurance policy against potential future credit losses. The repurchase of the Company's common stock will serve as an effective way to increase our franchise and long-term shareholder value.\" Under the stock repurchase program, shares of common stock may be repurchased by the Company from time to time in open market transactions or in privately negotiated transactions as permitted under applicable rules and regulations. Repurchases may be conducted, suspended, or terminated at any time without notice.  The extent to which the Company repurchases its shares and the timing of such repurchases will depend upon market conditions and other considerations as may be considered in the Company's sole discretion. Repurchases may also be made pursuant to a trading plan under Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, which would permit shares to be repurchased when the Company might otherwise be precluded from doing so because of self-imposed trading blackout periods or other regulatory restrictions.

    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO and CINCINNATI, Sept. 1, 2020 -- Aerpio Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (\"Aerpio\") (Nasdaq: ARPO) and Quantum Leap Healthcare Collaborative™ (Quantum Leap) announced today dosing of the first patient with razuprotafib in the I-SPY COVID Trial (NCT04488081), a phase 2 platform trial aimed at improving treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in severely ill COVID-19 (adult) patients. Further details about the study can be found here. \"Finding an effective therapeutic agent to treat patients who get critically ill in response to the COVID-19 infection is of utmost importance regardless of whether we have a vaccine,\" said Laura Esserman , the founder of the I-SPY programs. \"Our group is focused on screening promising agents and quickly identifying therapies that work. Razuprotafib was selected because of its potential to reverse the lung damage by activating Tie2 and stabilizing the leaky blood vessels that cause some of the damage. This has the potential to prevent death and improve time to recovery, which is what we need for this pandemic and any other that comes along in the future.\" \"We are extremely pleased by the rapid progress in study site selection and patient screening in this trial,\" said Joseph Gardner, President and Founder. \"We believe that razuprotafib has the potential to benefit critically ill COVID-19 patients, and hope to provide additional updates on progress before the end of the year.\" The I-SPY COVID TRIAL, is an adaptive platform trial sponsored by Quantum Leap Healthcare Collaborative. The goal of the trial is to rapidly screen, in parallel, multiple promising agents in order to identify drugs that will have a high impact on reducing mortality, and avoid or reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation for critically-ill COVID-19 patients. This study arm will evaluate razuprotafib's potential to sufficiently stabilize the pulmonary vasculature, in order to slow or prevent the progression of COVID-19 associated pulmonary pathology, decrease the need for ventilator support, and reduce mortality. About Aerpio PharmaceuticalsAerpio Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing compounds that activate Tie2 to treat ocular diseases and diabetic complications, as well as other indications in which the Company believes that activation of Tie2 may have therapeutic potential, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (\"ARDS\") associated with COVID-19 infections. Recently published mouse and human genetic data implicate the Angpt/Tie2 pathway in maintenance of Schlemm's canal, a critical component of the conventional outflow tract. The Company's lead compound, razuprotafib (formerly AKB-9778), a first-in-class small molecule inhibitor of vascular endothelial protein tyrosine phosphatase (\"VE-PTP\"), is being developed as a potential treatment for open angle glaucoma, and the Company intends to investigate the therapeutic potential of razuprotafib in other indications.. The Company is also evaluating development options for ARP-1536, a humanized monoclonal antibody, for its therapeutic potential in the treatment of diabetic vascular complications including nephropathy and diabetic macular edema (\"DME\"). The Company's third asset is a bispecific antibody that binds both VEGF and VE-PTP which is designed to inhibit VEGF activation and activate Tie2. This bispecific antibody has the potential to be an improved treatment for wet age-related macular degeneration and DME via intravitreal injection. Finally, the Company has exclusively out-licensed AKB-4924 (now called GB004), a first-in-class small molecule inhibitor of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF). GB004 is being developed by AKB-4924's exclusive licensor, Gossamer Bio, Inc. (Nasdaq: GOSS). For more information, please visit www.aerpio.com. About the I-SPY TRIALs The I-SPY 2 TRIAL for stage II and III breast cancer is the longest running and most successful adaptive platform tria in oncologyl.  Quantum Leap was able to use the existing I-SPY 2 TRIAL infrastructure methodology to develop the I-SPY COVID Trial (Investigation of Serial studies to Predict Your COVID Therapeutic Response with biomarker Integration and Adaptive Learning). The I-SPY COVID Trial is designed to rapidly screen promising experimental treatments, and re-purpose existing agents to identify the most effective treatments for severely ill COVID-19 patients. The trial is a unique collaborative effort by a consortium that includes the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), industry, patient advocates, philanthropic donors, and clinicians from multiple major U.S. research centers. Under the terms of the collaboration agreement, Quantum Leap Healthcare Collaborative is the trial sponsor and manages all study operations.

Quantum Leap provides operational, financial, and regulatory oversight to all I-SPY Trials. For more information, visit www.quantumleaphealth.org. About Razuprotafib (formerly known as AKB-9778)Razuprotafib binds to and inhibits vascular endothelial protein tyrosine phosphatase (VE-PTP), an important negative regulator of Tie2. Decreased Tie2 activity contributes to vascular instability in many diseases including diabetes and more recently has been shown to contribute to the development of increased IOP and glaucoma. Razuprotafib activates the Tie2 receptor irrespective of extracellular levels of its binding ligands, angiopoietin-1 (agonist) or angiopoietin-2 (antagonist) and may be the most efficient pharmacologic approach to maintain normal Tie2 activation. Aerpio is studying a topical ocular formulation of razuprotafib in open angle glaucoma and exploring the utility of subcutaneous razuprotafib for diabetic complications, including diabetic nephropathy.  In addition, a subcutaneous formulation of razuprotafib is being explored for its therapeutic potential in treating or preventing ARDS associated with COVID-19.

    "url": "https://www.prnewswire.com//news-releases/asus-announces-rog-strix-tuf-gaming-and-dual-nvidia-geforce-rtx-30-series-graphics-cards-301122411.html",
    "text": "FREMONT, Calif., Sept. 1, 2020 -- ASUS today announced three new NVIDIA® GeForce RTX™ GPUs, including ROG Strix and ASUS TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 3090, GeForce RTX 3080, ROG Strix and ASUS Dual GeForce RTX 3070 models. These new GPUs bring buffed-up cooling, PCBs, and power design to complement the new NVIDIA Ampere architecture. From competitive action to high-res immersion, this lineup delivers the latest and greatest in 3D gaming performance. The new NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 Series GPUs, the 2nd generation of RTX, features new RT Cores, Tensor Cores and streaming multiprocessors, bringing stunning visuals, amazingly fast frame rates, and AI acceleration to games and creative applications. Powered by the NVIDIA Ampere architecture, which delivers increases of up to 1.9 times performance-per-watt over the previous generation, the RTX 30 Series effortlessly powers graphics experiences at all resolutions, even up to 8K at the top end. The GeForce RTX 3090, 3080 and 3070 represent the greatest GPU generational leap in the history of NVIDIA. From top to bottom, the ROG Strix GeForce RTX 30 Series has received a host of improvements to deliver the next wave of innovation in thermal design and accommodate the impressive NVIDIA Ampere architecture. A new shroud with metal accents encompasses a trio of Axial-tech fans that have been tuned to fulfill specialist roles. The central fan leverages a full-height barrier ring and 13 fan blades that provide boosted static pressure to drive air through the heatsink fins and onto the GPU heat spreader. The two fans on the flanks feature 11 blades and half-height barrier rings to allow for more lateral dispersion and to provide better airflow through the cooling array. Turbulence between fans is reduced thanks to a reversal of the center fan's rotational direction. A larger heatsink that fills most of the card's 2.9-slot footprint was designed to leverage the increased airflow. To get heat up off the die and into the heatsink array, the surface of the heat spreader is polished with MaxContact technology, which improves smoothness at the microscopic level. The extra flatness allows for better contact with the die for enhanced thermal transfer. Improvements are not limited to the cooling array — top-shelf capacitors, chokes and power stages effortlessly deliver hundreds of watts at a millisecond's notice. Dubbed Super Alloy Power II, these components are soldered to the PCB using the ASUS-exclusive Auto-Extreme automated manufacturing process, ensuring smooth joints each card meets our rigorous specifications. Also included are FanConnect II headers that allow PWM fans to be tuned based on CPU and GPU temperatures, providing extra intake or exhaust for demanding 3D tasks and compute workloads. Builders looking for a quick and simple way to adjust the card's default behavior can flick an onboard Dual Bios switch to choose between \"performance\" and \"quiet\" profiles without software. Another ease-of-use feature is an onboard voltage-sensing circuit that monitors PSU rail voltage. The circuit is fast enough to catch any transients that result in the rail voltage dropping too low. If that happens, a red LED will light up to indicate a power supply issue, making it easier to debug the source of crashes during gameplay. The front side of the GPU has also been buffed up. An addressable RGB element can be customized with Armoury Crate software, and the Strix's reinforced metal frame adds a literal layer of durability. Flipping the card around reveals a metal backplate with a wide vent. The vent allows hot air to escape towards chassis exhaust fans instead of being recycled back into the GPU cooler. Beneath the GPU, a bracket provides consistent mounting pressure between die and heat spreader. Stainless steel is used for the I/O bracket to protect ports and provide a more secure mount. The sum of all the design improvements found on the ROG Strix GeForce RTX 30 Series GPUs results in a massive leap forward in thermal design. Paired with the outstanding performance of NVIDIA Ampere architecture, gamers now have access to fresh experiences, from insane frame rates in competitive titles, to smooth high-res gameplay in immersive AAA games. The TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 30 series has been stripped down and built back up to provide more robust power and cooling. A new all-metal shroud houses three powerful axial-tech fans that utilize durable dual ball fan bearings. Fan rotation has been optimized for reduced turbulence, and a stop mode brings all three fans to a halt at low temps. Beneath, independent heatsinks for the GPU and memory keep thermals under tight control. In-line with the TUF Gaming legacy, components are selected based on their durability and performance. In addition to top-shelf chokes and MOSFETs, capacitors that meet military-grade certification make the TUF stand tall amongst the competition. The Auto-Extreme automated manufacturing process ensures components are placed and attached accurately. And, to ensure flawless performance when it counts, the cards are subjected to a grueling 144-hour validation trial. Most of the rear is swathed in a protective metal backplate that prominently features a wide vent. The vent allows hot air to escape towards chassis exhaust fans instead of being recycled back into the GPU cooler. Beneath the GPU, a bracket provides consistent mounting pressure between the die and heat spreader. Stainless steel is used for the I/O bracket to protect ports and provide a more secure mount.

    "title": "ASUS Republic of Gamers Announces Meta Buffs Product Lineup for Leveling Up Gaming Experiences",
    "url": "https://www.prnewswire.com//news-releases/asus-republic-of-gamers-announces-meta-buffs-product-lineup-for-leveling-up-gaming-experiences-301122410.html",
    "text": "FREMONT, Calif., Sept. 1, 2020 -- ASUS Republic of Gamers (ROG) today announced an all-new lineup of gaming gear at the Meta Buffs online launch event. Aligning with the event theme, the new products are all meta buffs: status enhancements that are lighter, faster and more powerful for taking gaming experiences to a new level. The lineup features the new ROG Strix GeForce RTX™ 30 Series graphics cards, which unleash an amped-up thermal design and chart-topping performance with the NVIDIA® Ampere architecture. The new NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 Series GPUs, the 2nd generation of RTX, feature new RT Cores, Tensor Cores and streaming multiprocessors, bringing stunning visuals, amazingly fast frame rates and AI acceleration to games and creative applications. Powered by the NVIDIA Ampere architecture, which delivers increases of up to 1.9 times performance-per-watt over the previous generation, the RTX 30 Series effortlessly powers graphics experiences at all resolutions, even up to 8K at the top end. The GeForce RTX 3090, 3080 and 3070 represent the greatest GPU generational leap in the history of NVIDIA. ROG also introduced the ROG Swift PG329Q, ROG Swift 360 Hz PG259QN and ROG Swift 360 Hz PG259QNR gaming monitors for ultrafast and ultrasmooth visuals; the ROG Strix XF 120 fan for low-noise cooling performance and versatility; ROG Rapture GT-AXE11000, the world's first Wi-Fi 6E router; the ROG Strix Scope RX gaming keyboard, which debuts the responsive, reliable and durable ROG RX Red Optical Mechanical Switches; the ROG Keris Wireless mouse for compact and nimble control; the ROG Delta S headset for crystal-clear audio; and ROG Scabbard II, an extended gaming mouse pad with a protective nano-coating that repels water, oil and dust. \"Recently, people are spending much more time at home working, learning and playing. With a greater focus on doing what they enjoy the most, a lot of gamers have aspired to level up by adding peripherals or upgrading their PC components,\" said Jackie Hsu, ASUS Senior Vice President and Co-Head of the Open Platform Business Group and AIoT Business Group. \"For all of you looking to gain an advantage in gaming, ROG is here to upgrade your gaming experiences with meta buffs.\" By providing gamers with this lineup of meta buffs for optimal gameplay and potent status enhancements, ROG is delivering ultimate gaming experiences and the power to conquer the competition. From top to bottom, ROG Strix GeForce RTX 30 Series graphics cards deliver the next wave of innovations in thermal design and accommodate the dynamic NVIDIA Ampere architecture. A new shroud with metal accents encompasses a trio of Axial-tech fans that have been tuned to fulfill specialized purposes. The center fan leverages a full-height barrier ring and 13 fan blades to provide boosted static pressure that drives air through the heatsink fins and onto the GPU heat spreader. The two outer fans feature 11 blades each and half-height barrier rings to allow for more lateral dispersion and to provide better airflow through the cooling array. Turbulence between fans is reduced due to a reversal of the center fan's rotational direction. A larger heatsink that fills most of the card's 2.9-slot footprint was designed to leverage the increased airflow. To get heat up off the die and into the heatsink array, MaxContact technology has been utilized to polish the surface of the heat spreader and improve smoothness at the microscopic level. The extra flatness allows for better contact with the die for enhanced thermal transfer. Not only has the cooling array been enhanced, but top-shelf capacitors, chokes and power stages effortlessly deliver hundreds of watts at a millisecond's notice. ROG Strix GeForce RTX 30 Series graphics cards feature Super Alloy Power II components that have been soldered to the PCB using Auto-Extreme technology — an industry-exclusive automated manufacturing process — to ensure each card meets rigorous ROG specifications for quality and reliability. Also included are FanConnect II headers that allow PWM fans to be tuned based on CPU and GPU temperatures, providing extra intake or exhaust for demanding 3D tasks and compute workloads. Builders looking for a quick and simple way to adjust the card's default behavior can flick an onboard Dual BIOS switch to choose between \"performance\" and \"quiet\" profiles without software. Another ease-of-use feature is an onboard voltage sensing circuit that monitors PSU rail voltage. The circuit is fast enough to catch any transients that result in the rail voltage dropping too low. If that happens, a red LED will light up to indicate a power supply issue, making it easier to debug the source of crashes during gameplay. The front side of the GPU has also been buffed up. An addressable RGB element can be customized with the Armoury Crate software utility and the graphics card's reinforced metal frame adds a literal layer of durability. Flipping the card around reveals a metal backplate with a wide vent. The vent allows hot air to escape towards chassis exhaust fans instead of being recycled back into the GPU cooler. Beneath the GPU, a bracket provides consistent mounting pressure between die and heat spreader. Stainless steel is used for the I/O bracket to protect ports and provide a more secure mount. The sum of all the design enhancements found on ROG Strix GeForce RTX 30 Series graphics cards results in a massive leap forward in thermal design. Paired with the outstanding performance of NVIDIA Ampere architecture, gamers now have access to fresh experiences ranging from insane frame rates in competitive titles to smooth high-resolution gameplay in immersive AAA games. ROG Swift 360 Hz PG259QN and PG259QNR are the world's fastest esports gaming monitors with refresh rates of up to 360 Hz. The astounding 360 Hz refresh rate offered by ROG Swift 360 Hz PG259QN and PG259QNR delivers up to 50 percent more frames per second than 240 Hz gaming monitors, giving gamers an edge over the competition. The 24.5-inch FHD (1920 x 1080) display features Fast IPS panel technology. The liquid crystal elements in the display turn on and off up to four times faster than conventional IPS panels for a superfast 1 ms gray-to-gray (GTG) response time. The display is also HDR10 compatible for color and brightness that exceed that of ordinary monitors, treating gamers to ultrarealistic graphics. A built-in NVIDIA® G-SYNC® processor provides full variable refresh rate (VRR) range and variable overdrive for ultrasmooth gaming visuals with no tearing, stuttering or input lag. Reflex Latency Analyzer is a revolutionary system latency measurement tool integrated in new ROG Swift 360 Hz PG259QNR NVIDIA G-SYNC Esports displays. PC performance for competitive gaming is about responsiveness—how quickly the display updates after mouse clicks or movements. The Reflex Latency Analyzer detects clicks coming from the mouse and then measures the time it takes for the resulting pixels (i.e. a gun muzzle flash) to change on screen. This type of measurement has been virtually impossible for gamers to do before now, requiring over $7,000 in specialized high-speed cameras and equipment. Reflex Latency Analyzer provides a much more complete and accurate understanding of mouse, PC and display performance. Now with Reflex Latency Analyzer, gamers can start a match with confidence, knowing their system is operating exactly as it should be. In addition to the Reflex Latency Analyzer, the ROG Swift 360 Hz PG259QNR also comes with an ROG Desk Mount Kit that saves ample desk or table space. ROG Desk Mount Kit can be switched with the monitor stand in only three simple steps and has a C-clamp that opens up to 80 mm wide for compatibility with most desks. ROG Swift PG329Q is a 32-inch (2560 x 1440) 175 Hz gaming monitor that features Fast IPS panel technology and is the world's first NVIDIA G-SYNC Compatible gaming monitor with variable overdrive. The liquid crystal elements in the display turn on and off up to four times faster than conventional IPS panels for a superfast 1 ms gray-to-gray (GTG) response time. Quantum-dot technology with factory color pre-calibration, DisplayHDR™ 600 certification, DCI-P3 98% and sRGB 160% provide wide color space for stunning color fidelity. ASUS Extreme Low Motion Blur Sync (ELMB Sync) technology eliminates motion blur without sacrificing variable refresh rates, and customized variable overdrive on ROG Swift PG329Q takes smooth visuals to the next level by dynamically adjusting pixel response to accommodate an entire range of refresh rates for razor sharp images in the heat of battle. ROG Strix XF 120 is a versatile 120-mm 4-pin pulse-width modulation (PWM) cooling fan that has been tested and verified to deliver optimized acoustic profiles across a range of performance demands. It delivers 62.5 cubic feet per minute (CFM) airflow and 3.07 mm H2O static pressure, which provides the flexibility to use ROG Strix XF 120 for static pressure applications, including as a CPU cooler or radiator, or for chassis cooling. For further cooling power, its small fan hub allows greater space for airflow, and the aerodynamic fan blades and curvature of the frame struts help direct air throughput to minimize turbulence and maximize airflow. ROG Strix XF 120 features magnetic-levitation technology that reduces friction when the fan rotates for a quiet acoustic profile and 400,000-hour longevity, while the specially grooved blades and an anti-vibrating design further reduce noise. With an extensive operating range of 250 to 1800 RPM, the fan can be adjusted to as low as 250 RPM and even automatically turns off when set to 0% PWM duty cycle for an ultralow noise profile and super-efficient cooling. ASUS is an established leader in the networking market and was the first to launch a Wi-Fi 6 router. Now ASUS is delivering the wider bandwidth and increased 160 MHz channels of Wi-Fi 6E with ROG Rapture GT-AXE11000, the world's first Wi-Fi 6E router. With a tri-band design and 802.11ax Wi-Fi 6E connectivity, ROG Rapture GT-AXE11000 supports speeds of up to 11,000 Mbps and features WAN aggregation for WAN speeds of up to 2 gigabits per second. With 4x4 Wi-Fi 6 and a 2.5 gigabit-per-second LAN port, both wired and wireless networks can achieve speeds of more than 1 gigabit per second, bringing true multi-gigabit performance to life. GT-AXE11000 is powered by a quad-core 1.8 GHz 64-bit CPU with 1 gigabyte of RAM, so it can handle heavy traffic in Wi-Fi 6E networks. The router also uses the latest 6 GHz power amplifier to improve both the signal coverage and quality. Wi-Fi 6E technology takes advantage of the newly available radio spectrum in the 6 GHz band, which has three-times more bandwidth than the 5 GHz band. It also adds seven extra 160 MHz channels to the current Wi-Fi 6 standard, provides lower latency, and will be dedicated to Wi-Fi 6E devices for maintaining high speeds that will not be affected by legacy devices. ROG Strix Scope RX is the first mechanical RGB gaming keyboard to debut ROG RX Red Optical Mechanical Switches, which are the first in the world to feature a hollow-square stem design with embedded RGB LEDs for all-round per-key lighting. The unique design of each switch delivers a near-zero debounce delay to ensure instantaneous activation the moment a key is pressed. The hollow-square stem and X-stabilizer mechanism provide consistent wobble-free keystrokes, while the 100-million-keypress lifespan ensures extreme durability. ROG Strix Scope RX provides an alloy top cover and IP56 water and dust resistance to further ensure durability and longevity.

privacy and data security laws and regulations may hinder our ability to market our services, sell advertising and impose legal liabilities; we engage in extensive marketing efforts and the continued effectiveness of those efforts are an important part of our business; consumer protection laws and our failure to comply with them could damage our business; a substantial number of our Sirius XM subscribers periodically cancel their subscriptions and we cannot predict how successful we will be at retaining customers; our ability to profitably attract and retain subscribers to our Sirius XM service as our marketing efforts reach more price-sensitive consumers is uncertain; our failure to convince advertisers of the benefits of our Pandora ad-supported service could harm our business; if we are unable to maintain revenue growth from our advertising products, particularly in mobile advertising, our results of operations will be adversely affected; if we fail to accurately predict and play music, comedy or other content that our Pandora listeners enjoy, we may fail to retain existing and attract new listeners;

we have a significant amount of indebtedness, and our debt contains certain covenants that restrict our operations; our facilities could be damaged by natural catastrophes or terrorist activities; the unfavorable outcome of pending or future litigation could have an adverse impact on our operations and financial condition; failure to protect our intellectual property or actions by third parties to enforce their intellectual property rights could substantially harm our business and operating results; some of our services and technologies may use \"open source\" software, which may restrict how we use or distribute our services or require that we release the source code subject to those licenses; rapid technological and industry changes and new entrants could adversely impact our services; existing or future laws and regulations could harm our business; we may be exposed to liabilities that other entertainment service providers would not customarily be subject to;

    "text": "HOUSTON, Sept. 1, 2020 -- ION Geophysical Corporation (NYSE: IO) today announced a 3D new acquisition multi-client program in the southern North Sea.  The Mid North Sea High (MNSH) is one of the last remaining underexplored regions offshore the prolific United Kingdom Continental Shelf and a recent well confirmed one of the first new plays in recent years.  There is limited existing 3D data, providing a unique opportunity to image the entire area in high resolution to better assess future hydrocarbon potential. The majority of the up to ~11,000 sq km industry-supported survey will be acquired next summer, however, an initial phase started in August to enable completion of the entire program by the end of the 2021 season.  ION is pleased to have selected Shearwater GeoServices' Amazon Warrior for the initial acquisition.  Shearwater's modern acquisition technology platform, coupled with ION's proven imaging capabilities, will deliver a high-quality product as customers seek the best data to inform decision-making in this attractive new play. \"The Mid North Sea High is close to shore with existing infrastructure, where the relatively low cost of development makes it attractive for existing players and potential new entrants,\" said Joe Gagliardi, Senior Vice President of ION's Ventures group.  \"Recent play-opening drilling ignited interest in this area after oil was discovered last December.  Furthermore, the U.K. Oil and Gas Authority is promoting the MNSH as a key focus area for future UK oil and gas exploration.  Block awards for the 32nd U.K. Offshore Licensing Round are expected to be announced soon and this data will count towards block work commitments for new and existing 3D seismic.  This survey covers an area at least five times larger than any existing 3D data nearby and will provide a new regional perspective for imaging and developing the entire play.\" To learn more, visit iongeo.com/MidNorthSeaHigh3D.

    "text": "MERIDIAN, Idaho, Sept. 1, 2020 -- The Boys & Girls Clubs was in for a surprise yesterday when its team members logged on to a Zoom videoconference with Jacksons Food Stores to finalize the results of a customer coin drive in support of the national nonprofit. At the meeting, it was announced that giving by Jacksons customers in the round-up campaign, which was spurred by a national coin shortage, amounted to $101,881. This total greatly exceeded both partners' expectations for the campaign. What came next was an uplifting jolt as Jacksons president Cory Jackson revealed over the Zoom video call that the company would add another $101,881 to match the giving of its customers for a total donation of $203,762. The funds will be distributed to 22 Boys & Girls Clubs across the West in the states of Arizona, Idaho, Oregon, Nevada, Utah, and Washington. \"We were so inspired by the generosity of our customers, sharing in the enthusiasm as the totals grew and grew, that we decided to acknowledge our customers by matching their gifts to provide even more resources for the critical work being done by the Boys & Girls Clubs in our communities,\" said Jackson. The Jacksons family of companies has a long history of supporting the Boys & Girls Clubs of America. Not only has Jacksons provided sandwiches and other in-kind donations to Boys & Girls Clubs in the past, but they have also developed a specially designed bottled water in support of the Boys & Girls Clubs with PathWater, giving 25 cents for every bottle sold directly to the cause. This year, Jacksons is elevating its commitment to the Boys & Girls Clubs' mission, announcing a new partnership with the nonprofit as their primary giving recipient. \"We were profoundly grateful for the kindness and generosity of Jacksons' customers, and were then honestly a bit shocked by the unexpected match that Jacksons added to the campaign,\" said Colleen Braga of Boys & Girls Clubs of Ada County, Idaho. \"This money will help our doors stay open across the West, keeping kids safe and engaged in positive activities in our clubs—even helping provide a safe place for children of essential workers to attend their online classes,\" said Tim Motts of the Boys & Girls Clubs in Bellevue, Washington, another beneficiary of the funds. In addition to the coin drive campaign, Jacksons has participated in many community giving efforts, especially since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, including providing support to local businesses and schools. To further solidify the partnership with the Boys & Girls Clubs, Jacksons is planning a winter fundraising campaign where they will again double the impact of their customers by matching donations. In the meantime, Jacksons encourages customers to choose PathWater bottled water at Jacksons and ExtraMile by Jacksons to further support local Boys & Girls Clubs in a time when nonprofits like theirs are needed most. About Jacksons Food StoresSince John D. Jackson founded Jacksons in 1975 as a single service station, the Idaho-headquartered company has grown to be a nationally recognized chain of more than 260 company-operated convenience stores in Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, Arizona and Utah under the Jacksons Food Stores and ExtraMile Convenience Store brands. In addition, Jackson Energy now wholesales branded fuel to more than 900 locations throughout 9 western states."

You get to know a lot about people in those environments and we felt this opportunity to increase our capability and capacity was just a perfect fit.\" The acquisition aligns with the company's strategic vision to accelerate growth in its existing CM business by pursuing selective, larger institutional projects and partnerships where DiGeronimo's industry-leading integrated, single-source development, construction and capital service offerings add the most value. \"Being a market leader in what we do and where we do it is central to our strategic vision,\" said Mac Donley, President and CEO of Donley's. \"The concrete business is how Donley's started almost 80 years ago.

These high-quality services are presented to patients based on their unique needs and can range from health education and pharmacy information to patient finance and behavioral health programs. \"Our healthcare providers are being asked to do more with less resources than ever before, and our clients have challenged us to help them be successful in this new way of operating,\" said Joe Blewitt, CEO of Epion Health. \"Epion Patient Services specifically aims to provide valuable information to patients, previously handled in waiting rooms or other touch points during a visit, or not at all.

(NYSE: RMAX) – parent company of RE/MAX®, one of the world's leading franchisors of real estate brokerage services, and Motto Mortgage®, the first national mortgage brokerage franchise brand in the U.S. – today announced the acquisition of wemloSM, an innovative fintech company that provides third-party mortgage loan processing services. The 20-month-old, Florida-based startup is reshaping mortgage loan processing in the mortgage broker channel. Wemlo developed the first \"Service Cloud\" for mortgage brokers, combining third-party loan processing with an all-in-one digital platform. Its product offers the only enterprise-grade solution of its kind in the mortgage brokerage space. \"The acquisition of wemlo is an investment in our high-growth Motto Mortgage business, as it helps address one of the mortgage brokerage channel's biggest pain points – ineffective mortgage loan processing,\" said Adam Contos, CEO of RE/MAX Holdings. \"This tuck-in acquisition also diversifies our revenue and growth opportunities, reinforcing our M&A strategy of adding innovative companies that deliver value and improve the customer experience.\" David Rogove, a wemlo co-founder, said the acquisition will help wemlo scale and grow its operations across the mortgage broker channel. \"Our platform is a streamlined solution that offers a better way to manage mortgage loan processing, and we're excited that its impact will expand across the country,\" Rogove said. The product's underlying technology makes it easy to use, added wemlo co-founder Steven Gelley. \"The platform has automated tasks and an intuitive framework, enabling loan processors of any experience level to manage the workflow and provide a high level of service to the loan originators they support,\" Gelley said. Ward Morrison, President of Motto Franchising, LLC, noted that by increasing the speed and efficiency of mortgage loan processing, the acquisition will elevate the customer experience for borrowers served by Motto Mortgage offices, which in turn can help Motto Mortgage franchises expand their business. \"Motto Franchising and wemlo are trailblazers that share a passion for the mortgage brokerage channel. Combining forces was an opportunity we didn't want to miss,\" Morrison said. \"The acquisition will create more competitive advantages for Motto Mortgage franchises. Moreover, due to the demand for quality processing support in the mortgage broker channel, wemlo will keep serving its clients and continue to market its end-to-end solution throughout the mortgage brokerage industry.\" Gelley and Rogove will continue to lead the wemlo team, with operations staying based near Fort Lauderdale. They'll work closely with the Motto Mortgage technology team in Denver to plan and execute integrations within the Motto Mortgage product ecosystem while also using their industry knowledge to advance the wemlo roadmap for independent mortgage brokerages. The bottom line, Contos said, is that the almost four-year-old Motto Mortgage brand continues to evolve and make big moves. \"Ward and his team have done an outstanding job of turning the startup Motto Mortgage brand into a rising star in the space,\" Contos said. \"Adding the product line of this like-minded startup innovator adds firepower to the Motto Mortgage value proposition and unlocks tremendous overall growth potential for RE/MAX Holdings in the mortgage broker channel.\" About RE/MAX Holdings, Inc.

The following table sets forth the estimated amount of the sources of distribution for purposes of Section 19 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and the related rules adopted thereunder. The Funds estimate the following percentages, of their respective total distribution amount per common share, attributable to (i) current and prior fiscal year net investment income, (ii) net realized short-term capital gain, (iii) net realized long-term capital gain and (iv) return of capital or other capital source as a percentage of the total distribution amount. These percentages are disclosed for the current distribution as well as the fiscal year-to-date cumulative distribution amount per common share for the Funds. 0.0800 0.0800 0.0% 100.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.8800 0.2885 0.3827 0.0567 0.1521 32.8% 43.5% 6.4% 17.3% 13.07 0.0850 0.0850 0.0% 100.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.9350 0.3009 0.4128 0.0614 0.1599 32.2% 44.1% 6.6% 17.1% 13.77 0.0925 0.0103 0.0383 0.0439 11.1% 41.4% 47.5% 0.0% 0.9875 0.2706 0.1244 0.3460 0.2465 27.4% 12.6% 35.0% 25.0% 14.45 0.1670 0.1670 0.0% 100.0% 0.0% 0.0% 1.8370 0.2646 0.9929 0.1468 0.4327 14.4% 54.1% 8.0% 23.6% 26.20 0.1100 0.0337 0.0763 30.6% 69.4% 0.0% 0.0% 0.9222 0.3284 0.5213 0.0725 35.6% 56.5% 0.0% 7.9% 18.46 Note: NAV returns are as of August 31, 2020 and Distribution Returns include the distribution announced today. You should not draw any conclusions about the Fund's investment performance from the amount of this distribution or from the terms of the Fund's plan. If the Fund(s) estimate(s) that it has distributed more than its income and capital gains, a portion of your distribution may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the money that you invested in the Fund is paid back to you. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with 'yield' or 'income'. The amounts and sources of distributions reported in this 19(a) notice are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for accounting and tax purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The Fund will send you a Form 1099 DIV for the calendar year that will tell you how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes. Return figures provided below are based on the change in the Fund's Net Asset Value per share (\"NAV\"), compared to the annualized distribution rate for this current distribution as a percentage of the NAV on the last day of the month prior to distribution record date. 12.90% 7.35% 32.97% 6.73% 12.70% 7.41% 33.38% 6.79% 14.71% 7.46% 20.40% 6.83% 14.73% 7.65% 43.13% 7.01% -2.68% 5.45% -2.68% 5.00% Note: NAV returns are as of August 31, 2020 and Distribution Returns include the distribution announced today. While the NAV performance may be indicative of the Fund's investment performance, it does not measure the value of a shareholder's investment in the Fund. The value of a shareholder's investment in the Fund is determined by the Fund's market price, which is based on the supply and demand for the Fund's shares in the open market. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Monthly distributions offer shareholders the opportunity to accumulate more shares in a fund via the automatic dividend reinvestment plan. For example, if a fund's shares are trading at a premium, distributions will be automatically reinvested through the plan at NAV or 95% of the market price, whichever is greater; if shares are trading at a discount, distributions will be reinvested at the market price through an open market purchase program. Thus, the plan offers current shareholders an efficient method of accumulating additional shares with a potential for cost savings. Please see the dividend reinvestment plan for more information. Important Notes about Performance and RiskPast performance is no guarantee of future results. As with other investments, market price will fluctuate with the market and upon sale, your shares may have a market price that is above or below net asset value and may be worth more or less than your original investment. Returns at NAV reflect the deduction of the Fund's management fee, debt leverage costs and other expenses. You can purchase or sell common shares daily. Like any other stock, market price will fluctuate with the market. Upon sale, your shares may have a market price that is above or below net asset value and may be worth more or less than your original investment. Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a discount which is a market price that is below their net asset value.

    "text": "NEW YORK and TORONTO, Sept. 1, 2020 - iAnthus Capital Holdings, Inc. (\"iAnthus\" or the \"Company\") (CSE: IAN) (OTCQX: ITHUF), which owns, operates, and partners with regulated cannabis operations across the United States, is pleased to announce that Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. (\"ISS\") and Glass Lewis & Co. (\"Glass Lewis\"), have each recommended that iAnthus shareholders vote FOR the special resolution (the \"Arrangement Resolution\"), to approve an arrangement (the \"Arrangement\") pursuant to Section 288 of the British Columbia Business Corporations Act to effect the Company's previously announced recapitalization transaction (the \"Recapitalization Transaction\"). ISS and Glass Lewis are two leading independent proxy advisory firms who make voting recommendations to their subscribers, including pension funds and large institutional investors. \"Approval of this resolution will allow existing shareholders to retain some value by allowing them to retain their shares even after the company defaulted on some of its obligations. The Recapitalization Transaction will reduce the company's total consolidated debt by approximately US$54.7 million, and its annual cash interest expense will be eliminated. Given the company's extensive strategic review process, lack of alternatives, and weak financial position, the resolution is supported.\" \"…we believe that the benefits of undertaking the Recapitalization Transaction by way of an arrangement — where common shareholders can at least retain a portion of the equity in a better-capitalized firm — represents a superior outcome for common shareholders compared to the likely alternative of having to implement the transaction through CCAA Proceedings, which would result in no recovery of value for shareholders.\" If the Recapitalization Transaction is not approved by Equityholders (as defined below), the Recapitalization Transaction will be effected by way of proceedings under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (Canada). In such case, and based on current circumstances, there will be no recovery to you as a shareholder. This could cause you to lose the only opportunity you have to maintain any equity in iAnthus in connection with the Recapitalization Transaction. To ensure an informed decision is made, Equityholders are encouraged to read the Management Information Circular of the Company dated August 14, 2020 which can be found on the Company's website at: www.ianthus.com/2020-special-meetings and under the Company's SEDAR profile at www.sedar.com. The special meeting of the holders of the common shares of the Company (the \"Common Shares\"), options to purchase Common Shares, and warrants to purchase Common Shares (collectively, the \"Equityholders\"), will be held on Monday, the 14th day of September, 2020 at 11:00 a.m. (Vancouver time).

BOSTON, Sept. 1, 2020 -- Signifier Medical Technologies (\"Signifier\"), an innovator in the sleep disordered breathing market, is pleased to announce the appointment of Philip Hess as Chief Operating Officer. Mr. Hess is the former President & CEO of Bose Corporation, where he worked for 24 years across multiple leadership and operational roles. During his tenure, Mr. Hess was instrumental in Bose's evolution from a speaker and DVD company to a leader in headsets and wireless products. Most recently, he was leading Bose into connected wearables and health products. He will be located in Boston, MA, where he will have responsibility for growing Signifier's US infrastructure in preparation for the commercialization of the company's products.

I'm incredibly excited to be part of a team that will improve the quality of life for millions of people.\" \"I am delighted to welcome Phil to the company. He brings a valuable combination of skills and experience that we believe will benefit Signifier not only in the near-term, as we continue the global commercialization of eXciteOSA® and Snoozeal®, but also in the future as we seek to build a global innovation-led healthcare company,\" added Akhil Tripathi, CEO, and Co-Founder of Signifier Medical Technologies. \"Phil is a key partner of this growth strategy. With other recent important appointments in the US and Europe, we are building a highly capable global team to deliver on our ambitions.\" In July, Signifier Medical Technologies announced the appointments of Mr. Matt Sharris as Vice President of Sales for North America and Mr. Steve Saunders as Head of Sales in EMEA. Both bring strategic and commercial experience in respiratory and medical technologies and follow the company strategy to drive and maximize commercial footprint in their respective geographies. Signifier Medical Technologies is a medical technology company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative and non-invasive solutions for patients with snoring and sleep disordered breathing conditions. Signifier's proprietary therapy is the first and only daytime genioglossal (tongue) muscle-neurostimulation technology for snoring and mild obstructive sleep apnea, supported by clinical data from prestigious and well-recognized universities and academic institutions, that provides a safe and effective treatment for its patients.1-3 For more information, please visit www.signifiermedical.com. Nearly 1 billion adults aged 30 to 69 years are estimated to have obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) globally. There is a strong, clinically proven link between OSA and co-morbidities like diabetes, hypertension, and strokes. Mild OSA affects over 110 million people in the US and 100 million people in Europe. Obstructive sleep apnea is marked by the recurring collapse of the upper airways during sleep. The most common symptoms are restless sleep, snoring, tiredness during the day, decreased intellectual alertness, and personality alterations. Higher risks of cardiovascular diseases and increased mortality rates have been associated with OSA. Standard therapy of all advanced levels of sleep apnea is with a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device. Many patients find this therapy invasive, and the long-term compliance of CPAP therapy is limited, so there is a clear demand for new forms of treatment. 1.  Wessolleck E, Bernd E, Dockter S, et al.

    "text": "It is hard to imagine a less-loved sector than energy. There is a whole host of worries. In the short term, there is less of a need for energy of any sort, since economies are still running well below capacity due to the coronavirus pandemic. There is also the potential of higher taxes in a Joe Biden administration, and, bigger picture, climate change, which not only makes the sector unpopular to environmentally-focused investors but also is likely to prompt tougher regulation. Which is where an interesting piece of research from Goldman Sachs comes in. Entitled “Reimaging Big Oil: The Age of Transformation,” the bank says a new European Commission rule kicking in by the end of next year can actually drive this shift. It will require companies to classify their activities with regard to sustainability. “Big Oils have always been vertically integrated in oil, from production to downstream processing, trading and retail, and have been able over recent years to develop and manage complex energy supply chains in natural gas. We believe that they have the capability to transition from international oil companies to integrated energy companies and see them integrating vertically in low carbon power, leveraging their brand and trading capabilities to acquire power customers,” say the analysts, led by Michele Della Vigna. Under what is called the EU taxonomy, Goldman analysts see five categories that are eligible to be labeled as sustainable in which Big Oils have a material or growing presence: low-carbon electricity; petrochemicals manufacturing; biofuels manufacturing; clean hydrogen and carbon sequestration. They estimate European big oil companies could increase their share of taxonomy-eligible revenue to 25% by 2030, from 7% now, and 50% of capital expenditure, from 10% today. One issue: most of these low-carbon businesses aren’t consolidated and remain off balance sheet at the moment, the analysts say. “We therefore view that as the low carbon electricity business expands, it will become more important for these businesses to be consolidated and for sufficient visibility over these businesses to be provided by the companies,” say the Goldman team. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease official, said a COVID-19 vaccine could be available earlier than expected if ongoing clinical trials produce overwhelmingly positive results. The National Institutes of Health said there are insufficient data to recommend either for or against the use of convalescent plasma for the treatment of COVID-19 — approved on an emergency basis by the Food and Drug Administration after White House pressure — and should not be considered standard of care. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued an order forbidding evictions of tenants who can’t pay rent due to the coronavirus pandemic through the end of the year.

    "text": "European stocks gained on Wednesday, as the euro pulled back from a two-year high and Wall Street logged another bullish session. A  pullback for the euro was attributed to comments by Philip Lane, chief economist at the European Central Bank,  who said “the euro-dollar rate does matter.” “If there are forces moving the euro-dollar rate around, that feeds into our global and European forecasts and that in turn does feed into our monetary policy setting,” Lane reportedly said in an online conference Tuesday evening, according to Bloomberg. “These comments constitute the first pushback against appreciation in this EURUSD cycle and does not come as a surprise. However, our central case remains that the ECB will stick to verbal intervention, rather than cut the deposit facility rate,” said Gizem Kara, economist at BNP Paribas in London, in a note to clients. The economist said “risk-reward of cutting is not favorable right now” and if the market perceives the ECB has used up its firepower, the currency could even rise. Data released Tuesday showed eurozone consumer prices dropping in August for the first time in four years. But Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor,  said the company had “been performing strongly prior to the pandemic, and there are some signs that a recovery is already in place following the full opening of its sites at the end of June . Also, the latest survey from Nationwide Building Society showed U.K. annual house price growth picked up to 3.7% in August to reach a new all-time high.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/australia-confirms-its-first-recession-in-29-years-2020-09-01?mod=home-page",
    "text": "SYDNEY--Australia's economy plunged into its first recession in 29 years in the second quarter as the Covid-19 pandemic shut down firms and forced thousands into unemployment, with the outlook remaining murky as the key state of Victoria battles a resurgence of the virus. The economy contracted by a record 7% from the previous quarter, adding to a 0.3% drop in national output in the first quarter, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said Wednesday. This marks the first time the Australian economy has experienced consecutive quarters of GDP contraction since 1991, and snaps an unrivalled period of prosperity for the resource-rich economy. Private demand detracted 7.9 percentage points from GDP in the second quarter, driven by a 12.1% fall in household spending, the ABS said. Spending on services fell 17.6%, with declines in transport services, operation of vehicles and hotels, cafes and restaurants. International border closures crunched the tourism sector through the quarter, while consumer confidence was savaged as many firms were kept afloat only through government assistance. Economists expect that it could take years for the job market to recover from the shock and warn that many firms may yet fail. The downturn in the Australian economy has been cushioned by the deployment of a record fiscal stimulus focused on keeping firms in operation and retaining workers on payrolls, while the Reserve Bank of Australia has cut interest rates to almost zero and adopted measures to support liquidity for banks. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg will unveil the government's budget for 2020-21 next month, where he is expected to announce more measures to support the economy as it struggles to gather momentum over the coming quarters. RBA Gov. Philip Lowe also said this week that the central is examining ways to add more stimulus, though he also flagged that the state and federal governments are best placed to do the heavy lifting through increased spending on infrastructure. The biggest risks for the economic outlook now focuses on the state of Victoria, which accounts for around 25% of national output. A resurgence of the virus recently forced metropolitan Melbourne back into strict lockdowns, while mobility in other parts of the state is restricted. Virus clusters have also grown in New South Wales, with state border controls still being rigorously enforced. A strong Australian dollar is also emerging as a threat to the economic recovery. The currency traded at its highest levels since August 2018 this week, with the RBA noting the potential headwind to growth at its monthly board meeting Tuesday. Trade tensions with China are also rising, with major farm exports from Australia like beef and barley likely to be affected by China tariffs. Should the tensions escalate and affect mining exports, the threat to Australia's recovery will grow exponentially. But it's not all gloom in Australia, with the price of iron ore, the country's biggest export, remaining strong and helping to support big monthly trade surpluses. Overall, Australia's response to the pandemic has been large in scope and speedy, limiting infections and deaths.

    "text": "BOSTON — U.S. Sen. Edward Markey of Massachusetts defeated U.S. Rep. Joe Kennedy III in Tuesday’s hard-fought Democratic primary, harnessing support from progressive leaders to overcome a challenge from a younger rival who is a member of America’s most famous political family. It was the first time a Kennedy has lost a race for Congress in Massachusetts. Markey appealed to voters in the deeply Democratic state by positioning himself as aligned with the liberal wing of the party. He teamed up with a leading progressive, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, on the Green New Deal climate change initiative — and at one point labeled Kennedy “a progressive in name only.” That helped Markey overcome the enduring power of the Kennedy name in Massachusetts. The 39-year-old congressman sought to cast the 74-year-old Markey as someone out of touch after spending decades in Congress, first in the House before moving to the Senate. Kennedy said Tuesday night that the results aren’t the ones he’d hoped for, but pledged to work for Markey’s reelection. “The senator is a good man. You never heard me say otherwise,” Kennedy told supporters at an outdoor rally. Kennedy also suggested that the movement of supporters the campaign pulled together would continue past the current election. “We may have lost the final vote count tonight but we built a coalition that will endure,” he said. “I would this again with all of you in a heartbeat.” In the waning weeks of the campaign, Kennedy leaned into his family’s long political legacy in Massachusetts. His pedigree includes former President John F. Kennedy; former U.S. Senator and U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, his grandfather; and former U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy, who held a Senate seat in Massachusetts for nearly half a century until his death in 2009. Markey countered by leaning into his own family story — growing up in the working class city of Malden with a father who drove a truck for the Hood Milk company. In one campaign video, Markey also paraphrased a famous JFK quote, saying, “We asked what we could do for our country. We went out, we did it. With all due respect, it’s time to start asking what your country can do for you.” Markey also found himself on the defense at times during the campaign, with Kennedy repeatedly trying to portray him as having a tin ear to racial equity concerns. Kennedy faulted Markey for his initial opposition to the effort to desegregate the Boston Public Schools beginning in the 1970s. Markey countered by noting that he changed his views on the contentious issue that tore at the fabric of the city. He also said he supported the creation in 1973 of a state Senate seat aimed at helping elect a Black senator to the Massachusetts Legislature. Kennedy also repeatedly pointed to the father of Danroy “DJ” Henry, a young Black man from Massachusetts killed by police 10 years ago. Henry’s father has criticized Markey, saying he failed to help the family seek justice. Markey said he has apologized to the Henry family and signed a letter seeking a federal Justice Department investigation into the killing. Markey also wasn’t shy about talking about the Kennedy family, at one point pressing Kennedy to tell his father — former U.S. Rep. Joe Kennedy ll — to stop supporting a political action committee that was running ads against Markey. “I’m sure your father is watching right now,” Markey said. “Tell your father right now that you don’t want money to go into a super PAC that runs negative ads.” Kennedy said he had “no idea” if his father was helping fund the PAC. Late in the race, Kennedy also landed a major endorsement when Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi formally backed his candidacy. While Markey, who served with Pelosi in the House for decades, congratulated Kennedy, Pelosi’s decision angered some of Markey’s younger progressive supporters. Markey had earlier won the endorsement of Ocasio-Cortez and fellow Massachusetts Democratic U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren. “Ed Markey wasn’t afraid. He offered his expertise & partnership. He wasn’t scared of big policy & didn’t use kid gloves. It’s great to watch him overcome the odds and win tonight,” Ocasio-Cortez tweeted Tuesday night. The coronavirus upended the way both candidates could reach out to voters — severely limiting more traditional means of electioneering like knocking on doors, shaking hands or holding big rallies. Instead, the campaigns were largely waged online with virtual rallies, virtual endorsements, virtual fundraisers and virtual roundtable events to discuss issues. Eventually, as Massachusetts began to suppress the virus and emerge from a near lockdown, the candidates began to take their campaigns on the road — with appropriate social distancing rules and face masks in tow. The showdown drew criticism from some Democrats nationally who feared it would siphon time and money away from the primary goals of defeating President Donald Trump and winning back control of the Senate, It also wasn’t cheap, with both Kennedy and Markey raising millions to pay for campaign staff, television and digital ads and old-school campaign flyers. Markey now faces a general election contest where he is considered a strong favorite in a district that has historically elected Democrats. He’ll face the winner of the Republican primary, Kevin O’Connor, in November.

    "text": "House prices in the U.K. surged to an all-time high in August, fueled by pent-up demand and record low mortgage rates, according to new figures from Nationwide. Britain’s biggest building society said prices jumped by 2% in August, following a 1.8% rise in July, marking the highest monthly increase since February 2004. Annual house price growth jumped to 3.7% last month from 1.5% in July. The average price was £224,123 ($298,864) in August, up from just under £170,000 10 years ago, Nationwide said. Robert Gardner, Nationwide’s chief economist, said the bounce back in prices reflects the unexpectedly rapid recovery in housing market activity since the easing of lockdown restrictions. “This rebound reflects a number of factors. Pent-up demand is coming through, where decisions taken to move before lockdown are progressing. Behavioral shifts may also be boosting activity, as people reassess their housing needs and preferences as a result of life in lockdown,” he said. The housing market was hit hard in March at the height of the lockdown, as estate agents were forced to close their offices and viewings weren’t allowed. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the next few months are crucial for Barratt because, while the group demonstrated its strength during the lockdown, an extended recession would prove an even tougher test. “The taxpayer funded furlough scheme, mortgage holidays and a ban on evictions are all due to be unwound in the autumn, which all could have major implications on demand for housing going forward,” she said. Read:U.K. jobs picture looks bleak with 7.5 million furloughed or away from their job Shares in Barratt rose 6.91% in early morning London trading. Gardner said that the trends look set to continue in the near term, further boosted by Chancellor Rishi Sunak’s recently announced stamp duty holiday — the transfer tax paid when buying a home. However, Gardner cautioned that most forecasters expect labor market conditions to weaken significantly in the quarters ahead, as a result of the after effects of the pandemic and as government support schemes wind down. “If this comes to pass, it would likely dampen housing activity once again in the quarters ahead,” Gardner said. Shares of Tesla Inc.  extended its recent rocket ride by surging 6.3% in premarket trading Tuesday, putting them on track to open in record territory well above the $500 mark. The stock had soared 12.6% on Monday to a record after a 5-for-1 stock split took effect, and wrapped up August with a 74.2% monthly gain. That was the best monthly performance since it ran up 81.1% in May 2013, and the second-best monthly gain since going public in June 2010. The electric vehicle maker also ended August with a market capitalization of $464.3 billion, making it the seventh most valuable U.S. company. That helped propel Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk to be the world's third richest person, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Tesla's stock has advanced 1,004.4% over the past 12 months through Monday, while shares of other electric vehicle makers Nio Inc.  have climbed 565.4% and Workhorse Group Inc.  have hiked up 330.2% over the same time. The S&P 500  has gained 19.6% over the past 12 months. Lina Saigol is the London-based head of corporate news in the Europe, Middle East and Africa regions for MarketWatch and Barron’s Group.

    "text": "The 2020 election race between incumbent President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden is a coin toss,  LPL financial chief market strategist Ryan Detrick says. Indeed, a number of polls and betting odds indicate that a once-yawning lead enjoyed by Biden is starting to wane. Real Clear Politics shows that the Democratic nominee is leading Trump by 6.2 percentage points, based on an average of national polls, and his advantage in so-called battleground states, stands at a relatively razor-thin margin of 2.7 percentage points, according to a separate RCP poll average. But Detrick says that a simple equity-market chart has been the best predictor of U.S. presidential elections since 1984, proving 100% accurate—and is 87% accurate since 1928. The LPL analyst says that a chart of the S&P 500’s performance in the three-month period ahead of Election Day, which is Nov. 3 this year, has proven accurate over the past nearly four decades. Detrick writes that a positive return over that three-month period “may signal an increased likelihood that the incumbent party may win, while stock market losses during the same period have tended to predict an opposition party win.” To be sure, the strategist acknowledges that the market isn’t the economy and that millions of people are out of work due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, but notes that a look at what stocks may say about the outcome of election may be one thing for investor to consider as they prepare for an uncertain stretch of trade ahead of that key vote. “The unique circumstances around this year’s pandemic seem to add plausibility that this could be the first time in almost 100 years that this signal may be wrong—especially if the stock market and economy continue to recover between now and Election Day,” he wrote. All that said, Detrick said that Trump is still contending with an even bigger factor that could stymie his re-election chances beyond the stock-market gains: a recession. “History has shown that when a recession has occurred during the two years before the election, the incumbent president has tended to lose,” the analysts wrote. “ In fact, the economy incredibly has predicted the winner of every presidential election going back to President Calvin Coolidge,” he added. That statistic also offers its own inherent caveat since the recession that ensued in this pandemic is a global one and occurred a stunning and historic rate. But the president’s handling of the current pandemic and the ensuing public-health crisis may be the one thing that voters weigh against or in favor of Trump. MarketWatch columnist Mark Hulbert, in an article on Tuesday pointing out the fallibility of trying to spot correlations between stock performance and election outcomes, says that investors should “be on your guard…for those using the stock market to predict who will win the White House in November.” Notably, he says that the historical data can be contorted to say a number of things but also that the range period, including a three-month stretch before the election, is arbitrary and should raise a caution for observers. These tech companies have yet to report financial results for the quarter but have demonstrated they are benefiting from the pandemic. Mark DeCambre is MarketWatch's markets editor.

    "title": "Only 19% of Tesla analysts say buy the stock while investors remain ‘insatiable’",
    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/only-19-of-tesla-analysts-say-buy-the-stock-while-investors-remain-insatiable-2020-09-01?mod=home-page",
    "text": "There is an old Wall Street saying that investing isn’t about being right or wrong, it’s about making money. No one understands that better than an investor in Tesla Inc.’s stock. The financial fundamentals and the historical valuations of earnings suggest the market is wrong about the electric vehicle (EV) maker’s stock price, according to the overwhelming majority of Tesla analysts. But the stock keeps rising and Tesla investors keep making money. No one is making more money than Elon Musk, Tesla’s chief executive officer, largest shareholder and arguably its most important cheerleader, who just became the third-richest person in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak, who has been bearish on Tesla since Jan. 23 2019, when the stock closed at $57.52, put it this way in a note to clients: Spak raised his price target to $290 from $170, but his target was still 42% below Monday’s closing price. See related: His short position just got ‘obliterated,’ but this Tesla bear isn’t giving up. Also read: Tesla takes advantage of stock’s best month in 7 years with $5 billion offering. There are some fundamental reasons for investors being right to buy, as Tesla has been profitable for four straight quarters, while Wall Street was wrong to expect losses in three of the past four quarters. And despite concerns about the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, Tesla delivered way more EVs than expected during the second quarter. While the 5-for-1 stock split Tesla announced on Aug. 11 didn’t improve the company’s fundamentals in any way, investors were right to buy or hold on to their shares, for now, as the price has charged up more than 80% since the announcement through Monday. Read more: Tesla stock rally accelerates further into record territory after split takes effect. Despite such strong investor conviction, 81% of analysts don’t recommend buying. Of the 36 analysts surveyed by FactSet, only seven, or 19%, have the equivalent of buy ratings on Tesla’s stock. And only one of those analysts, Jefferies’s Philippe Houchois, had a price target — $500 — that was above Monday’s closing price. Meanwhile, half the analysts had the equivalent of hold ratings and 11 analysts, or 31%, had the equivalent of sell ratings. The average price target of all the analysts was $261.85, according to FactSet, which implied a 47% drop from Monday’s closing price. Most of what analysts have been wrong about Tesla has taken place over roughly the past five months. At the end of March, when the COVID-19 crisis was full blown, there were the same number of bearish analysts as there are now and the average stock price target was $101.86, just 2.8% below the March 31 closing price of $104.80. With the stock’s gain since then, Tesla’s market capitalization increased to $464.3 billion as of Monday’s close, which was the seventh highest among U.S. companies. RBC’s Spak suggested that what may also keep supporting the stock is that given the sheer market valuation of Tesla, many portfolio managers have to add to positions “just to keep pace.” He also believes investors have been willing to show more patience and look further into the future to value the stock. “We still view Tesla as fundamentally overvalued and having to grow into its valuation,” Spak wrote. Spak recognizes that Tesla is clearly ahead of its competition, has relatively inexpensive access to capital, the ability to attract talent, an “incredible” brand, and understands that “narrative, momentum and other factors” can impact the stock price. But he still believes that ultimately, a company’s value is related to fundamental factors. Basically, he’s suggesting that one of the biggest risk factors to Tesla’s stock isn’t good or bad fundamental news, but how investors value that news. The next major potential news catalyst is Tesla’s “battery day” scheduled for Sept. 22, of which Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said recently he’s expecting a number of potential “game changing” developments. One of those developments is the “million mile” battery, which in theory will support an EV for 1 million miles, which could put Tesla miles ahead of its traditional gasoline-powered automotive competitors. That said, Ives is one of the analysts that doesn’t recommend buying — he’s at hold — while his price target of $380 suggests the stock could fall 24%. For those looking for actual fundamental risks, the following are just some of those included in the more than 20 pages of “risk factors” Tesla lists in its latest quarterly report filed on July 28. So far, those risks haven't mattered to Tesla investors. • “We are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer.” • “We have been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by the global COVID-19 pandemic, the duration and economic, governmental and social impact of which is difficult to predict, which may significantly harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.” • “We have experienced in the past, and may experience in the future, delays or other complications in the design, manufacture, launch, and production ramp of our vehicles, energy products, and product features, or may not realize our manufacturing cost targets, which could harm our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.” • “Our future growth and success is dependent upon consumers’ willingness to adopt electric vehicles and specifically our vehicles. We operate in the automotive industry, which is generally susceptible to cyclicality and volatility.” • “Any issues or delays in meeting our projected timelines, costs and production at or funding the ramp of Gigafactory Shanghai, or any difficulties in generating and maintaining local demand for vehicles manufactured there, could adversely impact our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition.” • “If our vehicles or other products that we sell or install fail to perform as expected, our ability to develop, market and sell our products and services could be harmed.” • “The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and we may not be successful in competing in these industries. We currently face competition from new and established domestic and international competitors and expect to face competition from others in the future, including competition from companies with new technology.” With much of the market recovering from its March lows, it is no wonder that investors are looking for opportunities in beaten-up sectors. And bank stocks certainly fit the bill. Tomi Kilgore is MarketWatch's deputy investing and corporate news editor and is based in New York. You can follow him on Twitter @TomiKilgore.

    "title": "The dollar’s fall is likely to continue — here’s why you can thank the Fed",
    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-dollars-fall-is-likely-to-continue-heres-why-you-can-thank-the-fed-11598981331?mod=home-page",
    "text": "Foreign-exchange traders pushed the U.S. dollar to a new round of lows Tuesday before letting up, and currency watchers expect the greenback to remain under pressure on expectations the Federal Reserve will succeed in its attempt to drive inflation higher. There were no obvious catalysts for the initial Tuesday decline, but the dollar’s continued weakness comes after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell last week made clear that policy makers would tolerate above-target inflation as part of a new policy-making framework that abandons the central bank’s previous bias toward pre-emptively hiking interest rates when the labor market gets tight and signs of potential inflationary pressures build. “With Chair Powell cementing the negative real yield narrative for the dollar, there is little to suggest the current U.S. dollar bear trend is to stop, wrote analysts Francesco Pesole and Petr Krpata of ING, in a note. A resulting pickup in inflation expectations has dropped real yields — the yield on U.S. Treasurys minus expected inflation — to all-time lows. The real yield on the 10-year Treasury note on Tuesday stood near -1.08% after hitting an all-time low of -1.11% on Monday. The negative expected return makes the dollar less attractive to investors. The adoption of average inflation targeting and a tolerance for an inflation overshoot suggests interest-rate hikes “are a very distant proposition” and that U.S. real interest rates will remain low and may go even lower if the Fed succeeds in generating domestic inflationary pressure, they said. “None of these should strategically bode well for the dollar,” the analysts wrote, noting that high nominal and real rates were the key ingredients behind a stronger dollar in recent years. The dollar’s slide has been under way since spring, with the currency dropping back sharply after running to a more than three-year high in March as the pandemic-induced global economic collapse and accompanying financial market turmoil sparked a global scramble for dollars. As financial markets stabilized and central banks, particularly the Fed, stepped in to provide aggressive monetary stimulus alongside fiscal efforts by governments, the dollar has retreated. The Fed also moved to quench the global thirst for dollars by enhancing existing currency swap lines with major central banks and opening new ones. The dollar’s decline began to pick up steam in the summer, with the DXY falling 4% in July for its biggest one-month drop in nearly a decade. The dollar’s drop from its pandemic peak was already being attributed to falling U.S. real yields and expectations the global economy was poised to outperform the U.S. as the pandemic eventually runs its course. “The dollar cycle has turned because real yields have collapsed, in absolute and relative terms, and because the U.S. growth advantage relative to other major economies has been diminished,” said Kit Juckes, global macro strategist at Société Générale, in a Tuesday note. Related: Dollar could become a ‘crash risk’ if U.S. loses credibility, analyst warns Commodities are also seen benefiting from a weaker dollar, as it makes assets denominated in the unit cheaper to users of other currencies. Juckes argued, however, that last week’s Fed move was relatively “modest” after the policy makers in March proved their willingness to go far beyond what previous officials had done. Market participants, however, have embraced the policy changes without asking important questions, he said. Ahead of last week’s announcement, the Fed had already pledged to keep interest rates lower for far longer than previously anticipated, he noted. And, Juckes added, while the Fed’s willingness to allow inflation to move above its target for a time is a significant step, there’s little attention paid to the fact that the Fed has so far been unable to push inflation up to its 2% target any more than the Bank of Japan or the European Central Bank. “The currency has moved further than the shift in growth expectations so far would seem to justify,” he said, while bets on a falling dollar have pushed speculative positioning to an extreme, though “when that triggers a correction isn’t easily forecastable. ” The dynamic housing market is offering investors opportunities outside of high-flying technology industries.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-graduate-degree-will-be-a-job-magnet-as-the-world-recovers-from-covid-19-2020-09-01?mod=home-page",
    "text": "At the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, close to eight of 10 MBA students say they are not excited about the coming fall semester because the coronavirus pandemic has forced classes online. At UCLA’s Anderson School of Management, newly admitted international students are outraged that they cannot defer their admission to the school’s MBA program even if they cannot get a student visa to come to the U.S. At New York University’s Stern School of Business, students are demanding the reversal of a 3.5% increase in MBA tuition during COVID-19 and asking for a 5% to 10% discount on the price of their degrees because of the shift to virtual classes. Add to all of the anxiety and frustration the fact that some graduates from the most prestigious business schools, including Harvard and Stanford universities, saw their summer internships and full-time job offers clawed back by companies due to the COVID recession. Many more are deeply worried about their prospects for landing a job over the next year as still more companies freeze budgets and hiring plans. So is this a time to apply to an MBA program and go even further into debt? You better believe it is, and here’s why. A recession and a health crisis, no matter how severe, will not last forever. But while it lasts, many will find their opportunities to advance at work diminished or completely curtailed. Many more have already found themselves on unemployment. By the time this year’s incoming MBA students graduate in 2023, it is almost a certainty that both COVID-19 and the economic downturn will be in the rearview mirror. The Class of 2023 will inevitably graduate into a fully recovered economy, better prepared to take full advantage of the upturn. No less crucial, they will have been the beneficiaries of not merely the business basics or of the leadership development a strong MBA program provides; they will be steeped in both data analytics, specifically how to smartly harness massive datasets for decision making, and how to leverage new technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, to gain important efficiencies in a business moving forward. Of all the graduate degrees you could earn, an MBA from a highly selective business school is pretty much a no-brainer investment. The top five schools for average starting pay last year — base salary plus signing bonus — are all big names, led by the Wharton School at $172,016, NYU Stern ($168,291), Stanford ($168,226), Dartmouth College’s Tuck School of Business ($166,251), and the University of Virginia’s Darden School of Business ($165,292). In all, 12 schools in the top 25 of U.S. News’s MBA ranking report starting salaries above $160,000, and 17 above $150,000. “If you stayed at work in 2021, your career options and earning potential in 2023 would be more limited if you had gone to business school,” noted Soojin Kwon, managing director of full-time MBA admissions and program at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business. Why? Kwon notes that students will gain three advantages by going back to school that they won’t get by staying in a job during the pandemic. “One, you’ll meet with and learn from hundreds of smart, ambitious and interesting people you wouldn’t have met if you didn’t go to business school,” Kwon said at a recent panel discussion for Poets & Quants.  “Two, you’re going to learn how to network and interview for jobs in an industry or function that you’re interested in going into, and most, if not all MBA recruiters this year are planning to do virtual recruiting. So you’re going to learn how to interview in the format in which recruiters are going to be recruiting. In addition, she said, “You’re going to gain access to a network of tens of thousands of business school alumni and hundreds of thousands of alumni in the broader university community. You could absolutely find another job through LinkedIn, but it’s no secret that you’re more likely to get a response if you have some kind of connection, and an MBA from a top school with the support of alumni provides that invaluable connection for life.” During the Great Recession of 2008-2009, the job situation was just as miserable and prospects for many MBAs appeared so dim that some openly questioned their decision to borrow money to get the degree. Robert Bruner, then dean of the University of Virginia’s Darden School of Business, found himself having to defend the value of the MBA. He rose to the challenge, and his points then made much sense now. Education adds significant value to human potential. “Generally, research finds real rates of return on investment upwards of 10% and as high as 50%. And there is a correlation between years in school and earning power but that’s only the quantitative part. Every year, students graduate who are more self-confident, better communicators, and more promising leaders than when they enrolled. And they have joined an alumni network that has helped in good times and bad.” Indeed, long-term thinking beats short-term thinking all the time. Young professionals have a long career ahead of them. “With the benefits of modern medicine, you can probably look forward to a career of 50 years,” Bruner wrote. “Are you judging the worth of an MBA by only the first job you get out of B-school? Take the long view. If you could discount the marginal benefits of an MBA from a competitive school over the next 50 years, I’d guess that they well exceed the costs. Don’t discount the future too steeply.” Truth is, you can bet with certainty that tough times will again appear once this pandemic is under control and the economy recovers. The ability to assess and bear sensible risks is the core of business and entrepreneurship. Pursuing a graduate degree in business to learn valuable skills, cultivate one’s leadership potential, and acquire a supportive network of connected professionals is a risk worth taking. John A.

    "text": "What does a travel writer do during a pandemic, other than fantasize about the exotic trips he can’t take? If you are fortunate enough to have a friend with a boat, you join him in a COVID-free “bubble” and cruise down the California coast. My friend Charlie lives in Los Angeles, as do I. His boat — a Tollycraft 44 CP named “Allegro” — was docked in a marina in San Rafael, Calif., in the San Francisco Bay. Since the boat wasn’t doing him any good in Northern California during the pandemic, he decided to move it closer to home, to the Ventura, Calif. marina an hour’s drive north of Los Angeles. Needing a crew to help, he hired Chris, a professional captain with experience cruising the unprotected waters off the California coast. He also asked me, with little boat experience other than the toy ones my mother used to lure me into the bath when I was a kid. My role was to make sandwiches and keep Charlie and Chris awake with stories of past travel adventures and romantic misadventures buried even deeper in my past. Before we could go anywhere, even in the car to drive from Los Angeles to San Rafael, we had to make sure we would not infect each other while living in close quarters for several days. Both Charlie and I are in our late 70s and have underlying medical conditions that might put us at even greater risk. All three of us went at the same time to get tested for the coronavirus. We also promised not to do anything foolish within the two days before the test, which might be too soon to be picked up by the test, and over the several days after we received our results. We all tested negative and were good to go. Less than a week later, we piled into a rental car and headed north. The five-day cruise was the best five days I’ve had since the COVID-19 restrictions began. The highlights included: From this brief but successful adventure, I learned two lessons — other than make friends with people who own a boat: 1) Create an antiseptic bubble of travel companions and 2) manage interactions and reduce possible exposure with people outside of your bubble. There are several ways to create a bubble. We took the most secure route, getting tested. A less-secure but easier approach would be to travel with trusted friends. But therein lies the rub. Levels of vigilance vary widely among our friends, from those who disinfect their mail to others who visit family and get haircuts. Some I would feel O.K. traveling with, others not. The only way to make sure is for everyone to get tested before leaving for the trip. Even that may not be enough. Traveling with a group also requires an expectation and trust that everyone within the bubble will minimize the chance of exposure for the two-to-three days before the test (about how long it takes for an infection to show up in the results) and for the few days between the test and the departure date for the trip. Once you have built your bubble, the next challenge is to isolate it and manage contact with people outside your bubble when you can’t isolate, especially as the bubble moves to, from, and within your destinations. It is relatively easy in a boat or a fully stocked RV, but harder if you are driving, or worse yet, flying. Read: COVID-19 hit the hotel industry hard. Here’s how hotels are pivoting in the new reality Even on a boat or RV, there is the possibility of exposure to the virus. To minimize risk on our drive to San Rafael, we packed lunches and snacks. We still had to stop for gas and bathroom breaks. Of course, we used masks and gloves and opted for a highway rest stop bathroom, assuming it would be cleaner than a gas station, though I am not sure it was. In any case, we didn’t linger. In the Monterey, Calif. marina, where we spent our first night at sea, signs were posted prominently asking everybody to wear masks. It looked like everyone took this seriously, including the dock workers who helped us tie up to the dock and refuel the boat. Further south in Morro Bay, safety was more of a challenge. Few signs were posted and people seemed more lax about wearing masks. While Chris and Charlie checked the weather and plotted our course around Point Conception, I did what I do best, get dinner. I picked up fish and chips from a nearby restaurant. Most of the patrons didn’t wear masks. I wore mine and moved gingerly to keep my distance from the other customers. The bottom line is that traveling during a pandemic requires a combination of informed practices for things you can control and trust for those you can’t. We live with risk every time we get up from the couch. We can’t eliminate it. But we can minimize it and keep the probability of infection low by diligently following the behaviors and strategies we know will work, namely: minimize contact and exposure wherever possible; wear a mask; keep your distance and wash your hands.

    "text": "Deal talks for TikTok’s U.S. operations have hit a snag over the key question of whether the app’s core algorithms can be included as part of a deal, according to people familiar with the matter. The algorithms, which determine the videos served to users and are seen as TikTok’s secret sauce, were considered part of the deal negotiations up until Friday, when the Chinese government issued new restrictions on the export of artificial-intelligence technology, according to people familiar with the matter. Now both sides are trying to figure out whether the order means the algorithms need Chinese government approval for transfer, and if so, whether Beijing would sign off. The complexity involved has reduced the chances that a deal could be completed any time soon. TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance Ltd., has said it will comply with the Chinese government order, and is trying to get clarity from Beijing on how to proceed with a sale if the new restrictions apply to its algorithms, some of the people said. For bidders, the idea of buying TikTok without the algorithms completely changes the outlook on what the companies are bidding for, other people familiar with the situation said. They believe a large portion of the value of TikTok is in the suggestion algorithms that keep users glued to the app. An expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.

    "text": "Nvidia Corp.’s stock closed at a record Tuesday as the chip company launched its new line of gaming cards and detailed more videogames that are taking advantage of the ray-tracing technology that was introduced in the previous line of graphics-processing units. Huang announced the new chips in a YouTube video Tuesday morning, similar to his announcement of new Ampere-based server chips in May. The new cards build upon Turing architecture, which brought real-time ray tracing — the rendering of realistic-looking lighting and shading — to the fore. But when RTX ray tracing made its appearance two years ago, critics argued that developers were slow in putting out enough games that took advantage of the technology. Nvidia said the RTX 3080 will be available Sept. 17, with the RTX 3090 available Sept. 24, and the RTX 3070 “sometime” in October. That will give the company about six weeks of sales of the new cards before Nvidia’s fiscal third quarter finishes up at the end of October. Nvidia said the $499 RTX 3070 runs faster than its $1,199 RTX 2080 Ti, which is currently listed as out of stock, and up to 60% faster than its original RTX 2070, which was $499 when Nvidia launched its 20-series of Turing-architecture gaming cards two years ago. The upgrade to the RTX 2070, or the “Super” version that came out in July 2019, last listed at $499. Similarly, the mid-tier $699 RTX 3080 is up to two times faster than the RTX 2080, Nvidia said. The “Super” version of the 2080 card last listed at $699. At the high end, however, Nvidia appears to be offering a deep discount on improved performance. The company said its $1,499 RTX 3090 runs up to 50% faster and 10 times quieter than its flagship Titan RTX, which last listed at $2,499. Huang said demand for the limited-run Titan “surprised us” as filmmakers were using the Titan to make 4K movies, bloggers used it to build broadcast workstations, and others used the card for applications that required its power. “There is clearly a need for a giant GPU that is available all over the world, so we made a giant Ampere,” Huang said in his presentation. Nvidia would not comment on whether it would lower prices on its 20-series Turing cards. As of market close on Tuesday, the company had yet to change 20-series card pricing on its website, and was still offering its RTX 2060 Super card at $399. Less than two weeks ago, Nvidia execs talked a lot about gaming on the company’s earnings conference call even though data-center sales had surpassed gaming for the first time ever, with Huang forecasting “this may very well be one of the best gaming seasons ever.” Biden condemns rioting, Massachusetts votes in closely watched Democratic primaries, Trump official reportedly wants the U.S. to adopt “herd immunity,” and other news to start your day.

    "text": "Bill Ackman has an idea for saving the system that made him a billionaire. The Pershing Square Capital Management chairman told investors in a recent note that, in order to preserve capitalism, steps need to be taken to close the increasing inequality gap. One possible measure: investment accounts for every child. Under Ackman’s plan, each child born in the U.S. would receive $6,750 in a government-funded basket of index funds that could only be tapped at retirement. Assuming 8% returns over 65 years from birth to retirement, that total would ultimately exceed $1 million, and it would cost the government about $26 billion a year, if the birthrate holds. “Compounded returns over time are indeed one of the great wonders of the world, and every day we wait to address this issue, the problem looms larger,” the hedge-fund manager wrote. He added that a government-led push for equities-investing accounts could “encourage greater financial literacy” and spread the stock-market’s gains across a wider swath of the U.S. population. “Americans that have no ownership in the success of capitalism, and who are suffering economically, are more motivated to turn toward socialism or other alternatives,” he said in the note. Meanwhile, Ackman’s strong showing this year continues, thanks in large part to a well-timed bearish bet on corporate bonds in early 2020. That investment yielded a profit of more than $2 billion during the March coronavirus meltdown in the stock market. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the federal government’s top infectious disease expert, says Labor Day weekend will be key in determining whether the U.S. gets a “running start” at containing the coronavirus this fall.

    "text": "So much for playing videogames to escape reality — the 2020 U.S. presidential election has now even infiltrated “Animal Crossing.” Yes, the millions of people playing “Animal Crossing: New Horizons” since it was released for the Nintendo Switch in March, in which players build their own virtual islands populated by cute critters, can now add Joe Biden campaign signs to their digital front yards. Biden’s presidential campaign revealed its “Animal Crossing” partnership on Tuesday. “Show your Biden/Harris pride virtually!” it declared on its official campaign store, along with QR codes for players to scan and add the free political insignia all over their islands. The designs include the official Biden-Harris logo, a Team Joe logo, a “Joe” Pride logo, as well as a print of three aviator sunglasses in red, white and blue. “’Animal Crossing’ is a dynamic, diverse, and powerful platform that brings communities together from across the world,” Christian Tom, director of digital partnerships for the Biden campaign, said in a statement. “It is an exciting new opportunity for our campaign to engage and connect Biden-Harris supporters as they build and decorate their islands.” And the virtual campaign signs fit into the Biden camp’s pandemic playbook of hosting more online events, live-streamed fundraisers and speeches, while Trump has continued to campaign in person. Reps from Nintendo did not immediately respond to a MarketWatch query about whether the Biden campaign had to pay for those virtual signs to be available in the “Animal Crossing” game. Trump’s reelection campaign has not officially created campaign signs or T-shirts for “Animal Crossing,” although players can make their own — and in fact, have already done so. There are Trump and MAGA insignia on many individuals’ islands. CNN noted that, so far, there actually appear to be a few dozen more “MAGA” and “Trump” designs created by “Animal Crossing” gamers than Biden designs. Trump campaign deputy national press secretary Samantha Zager mocked Biden’s videogame gambit on Tuesday. “This explains everything: Joe Biden thinks he’s campaigning for president of ‘Animal Crossing’ from his basement,” she told CNN. “The Trump campaign will continue to spend its resources campaigning in the real world with real Americans.” Many people on social media also groaned at the Biden campaign’s “Animal Crossing” signs, as well, recalling Hillary Clinton calling on voters to “Pokemon Go to the polls” while she was running against Trump in 2016, citing another Nintendo gaming title. This isn’t the first time that political movements have made a mark in “Animal Crossing,” however. Players have also added Black Lives Matter flags and T-shirts to the game.

    "text": "The number of confirmed cases in the U.S. of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 rose to 6.03 million on Tuesday, with new cases increasing in much of the Midwest and falling from their July peaks in the South and West. The U.S. added more than 36,000 new cases on Monday, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University, while more than 480 deaths were counted. Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota counted more cases in a recent seven-day stretch than any other seen since the start of the outbreak, the New York Times reported. The U.S. accounts for about a quarter of the 25.5 million confirmed cases globally and almost a fifth of the 851,781 deaths counted by Johns Hopkins, or 183,733. On a per capita basis, the U.S. is fourth in the world with 55.95 deaths per 100,000 people, the data shows, after Peru, Chile and Brazil. Twitter removed a post that was retweeted by President Donald Trump at the weekend, claiming the U.S. death toll is greatly exaggerated. The post was sent by “Mel Q,” an adherent of the QAnon conspiracy theory. It claimed that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had updated its COVID-19 numbers and found only 9,000 of reported deaths were from the virus, while the rest were people with two or three other serious illnesses. Twitter said the post violated its coronavirus misinformation policy. The social-media site did not remove another post retweeted by Trump from a conservative website that criticized key members of Trump’s own White House task force, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Diseases, and Dr. Deborah Birx, coordinator of the task force. Fauci told ABC in an interview Tuesday that the CDC numbers did not mean that people died of causes other than COVID-19. “That does not mean that someone who has hypertension or diabetes who dies of Covid didn’t die of Covid-19. They did,” Fauci said on “Good Morning America.”  “So the numbers you’ve been hearing -- there are 180,000-plus deaths -- are real deaths from Covid-19. Let (there) not be any confusion about that.” The head of the World Health Organization said the idea that high death rates from the virus are not a concern if it’s mainly older people who are dying is “moral bankruptcy.” “Accepting someone to die because of age is moral bankruptcy at its highest, and we shouldn’t allow our society to behave this way,” WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at the agency’s latest press briefing. • Russia has more than 1 million confirmed cases of COVID-19, the English-language Moscow Times reported, the fourth highest in the world, after the U.S., Brazil and India. Russia will start its first mass deliveries of its COVID-19 vaccine this month, Health Minister Mikhail Murashko said on Monday. The governor of a remote Siberian region, the republic of Tyva on the border with Mongolia, is reported to have contracted the virus for a second time in Russia’s first such case, the paper reported. Hong Kong researchers last week confirmed a case of a patient who had been reinfected with COVID-19. That same week, two European patients were reported to have suffered that fate, the Guardian reported, citing regional public broadcasters in the Netherlands and Belgium. • Poland has banned direct flights from 44 countries, including Spain and the U.S., to contain the spread of the virus, the Guardian reported, citing government officials. India, Brazil, Argentina, Malta, Montenegro, Mexico, Israel and Romania are also on the list, the paper reported, but China and Russia have been removed, local media reported. The ban will become effective on Wednesday. Poland has 67,922 confirmed cases of the virus, according to the Johns Hopkins data, and 2,058 people have died. • Tourism traffic to Spain fell 75% in July from the year-earlier period, according to Spain’s National Statistics Institute, costing the country billions of euros in lost revenue. Spain is currently grappling with a fresh spike in cases, after recording almost 24,000 new infections over the weekend. In the past two weeks, Spain has seen more than 96,000 new infections, according to its health ministry, making it a hot spot for the outbreak for the second time. Madrid is the epicenter, with about 16% of area hospital beds currently occupied by COVID-19 patients. • Hong Kong launched a mass testing program on Tuesday, amid heightened tensions with mainland China following its efforts to crack down on the city’s democracy movement. The free scheme has had a shaky start, amid concerns that the involvement of doctors and testing companies from the mainland will lead to harvesting of DNA and other data, the Washington Post reported. “I’m postulating that in the most optimistic case, perhaps a million people will turn up, but if I say that, I will be announced as unpatriotic,” said Gabriel Choi Kin, head of the Hong Kong Medical Association, the paper reported. “Ultimately, this will be a display of whether citizens trust the government.” • More than a million students returned to schools in the Chinese city of Wuhan on Tuesday, the original source of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to media reports. Wuhan was locked down for more than two months starting in late January and has reopened gradually since April. About 3,869 inhabitants of the city died from the virus, according to official Chinese data, accounting for more than 80% of China’s total official death toll of 4,724. Students had their temperatures taken at the school gates and were given lessons on hand washing, according to the New York Times. At least 16.9 million people have tested positive and then recovered from COVID-19, the Johns Hopkins data show. Brazil is second to the U.S. with 3.9 million cases and 121,381 deaths. India is next with 3.7 million cases and 65,228 deaths. Mexico has 599,560 cases but 64,414 deaths, the fourth highest in the world. The U.K. has 338,085 cases and 41,589 deaths, the highest in Europe and fifth highest in the world. AstraZeneca said the Phase III trial is seeking up to 30,000 participants to test the vaccine, designated as AZD1222. Participants will either receive two doses of AZD1222 or a saline placebo four weeks apart. In July, AstraZeneca said an early-to-mid-stage study showed the vaccine was “well tolerated and generated robust immune responses” against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. American manufacturers grew again in August for the fourth straight month, but companies still aren’t bringing back lots of workers or seeking to increase investment with the coronavirus pandemic still infecting the economy, MarketWatch’s Jeffry Bartash reported. The Institute for Supply Management said its manufacturing index rose to 56% in August from 54.2% in July. Readings over 50% indicate growth. Economists surveyed by MarketWatch had forecast the index to total 54.9%. Althought the index hit a 21-month high, manufacturers aren’t doing as well now as they were two years ago. Businesses executives are asked if their companies are doing better or worse compared with the prior month, but the survey doesn’t reveal how much better. Most manufacturers are producing fewer goods with fewer workers than they were before the coronavirus pandemic. The index had fallen to an 11-year low of 41.5% in April during the height of the crisis. The index for new orders jumped to 67.6% from 61.5%, marking the highest level since 2004. Yet other measures of actual production show new orders are actually still about 5% below precrisis levels. The production gauge rose to 63.3% from 62.1%. Timothy Fiore, chairman of the survey, said executives were “generally optimistic” but “to a lesser degree compared with July.” Coronavirus cases spiked during the summer and sapped the economy of some of the momentum built up in May and June. “Not all firms have the capacity to bring all of their staff back from furlough and those that do face difficult challenges in figuring out how and when to safely bring their workers back to work,” economists Thomas Simons and Aneta Markowska of Jefferies LLC wrote to clients.

    "title": "This university created its own COVID-19 test and is testing students twice a week — but is it enough to prevent an outbreak?",
    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-university-created-its-own-covid-19-test-and-is-testing-students-twice-a-week-experts-are-watching-to-see-if-its-enough-to-prevent-an-outbreak-11598648724?mod=home-page",
    "text": "Over the roughly week and a half that Ian Katsnelson has been back at his college, the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, the junior has developed a “mini competition” with his friends to see who can finish the process of taking their COVID-19 tests the fastest. “The hardest part for sure is garnering enough saliva,” Katsnelson said of the rapid saliva test, which was created by scientists at the school. He’s perfecting his strategy for his trips to the tents where testing takes place: “I’ve built up my saliva in line before I’ve even gotten inside the tent, so I can get in and get out real quick.” Hallie Workman, a PhD candidate in communications at U of I said, “there’s a lot of scouting that goes on” as students try to find out which of the more than a dozen testing tents on campus have the shortest line. “I have my tent in my time of day that always works well,” Workman, 30, said. “You just sit there trying not to make eye contact with people as you dribble spit into a tube.” These were just some of the rituals that marked an unusual first week of classes at the University of Illinois, which is requiring students, faculty and staff accessing campus to get tested for COVID-19 twice a week as part of its reopening plan. As colleges across the country have sent students home or back to remote classes amid COVID outbreaks, officials at the University of Illinois are hopeful that their approach to mitigating the pandemic’s spread on campus — which includes a test developed at the school that is now being performed under the Federal Drug Administration’s emergency use authorization — will be enough to keep students in some in-person classes through November.  It’s not a small undertaking. The school had 51,000 students in the fall of 2019. Since July 6, the school has processed 121,333 COVID tests and in the five days leading up to Friday, which marked the end of the first week of classes, the school administered 47,075 tests and had a 0.75% positivity rate. For context, there were roughly 730,000 COVID tests administered in the entire U.S. on a recent August day, according to Johns Hopkins University’s Coronavirus Resource Center. On Aug. 24, U of I administered more than 17,000 tests alone. So far, the number of positive cases is in line with what the school’s modelers predicted — well under 400 cases in the week before classes began. The next couple of weeks will be a “defining moment” for U of I as it works to prevent the spread of COVID-19 on campus and in the community, said Robert Jones, the school’s chancellor. “We know that people are watching,” he told MarketWatch. And indeed, according to Joshua Salomon, the director of the Prevention Policy Modeling Lab at Stanford University, “people are really going to be watching this carefully,” describing the efforts the school has taken as “encouraging.” “We don’t know whether it’s going to succeed,” he added. “What we do know is that the likelihood of succeeding without testing is very small.” At many universities that have reopened their campuses for in-person instruction, students may have been tested upon reentry to university housing or campus more broadly and may be subject to random screening. But models from researchers at Yale School of Public Health and U of I, indicate that in order to prevent an outbreak on a college campus — and not just monitor one — students and those interacting with them regularly need to be tested multiple times per week. U of I may be the only university in the country hewing to that standard. Officials will know around Sept. 25, one month and one day after the start of classes, if their efforts have worked, said Rebecca Lee Smith, an associate professor of pathobiology at U of I who is part of the team that developed the school’s testing and other protocols. “We’re going to be keeping track of how well we’re doing going from test results to isolation to contact tracing and quarantine,” Smith said. They’ll also be looking out for new positive cases, a sign of community spread. The outcome that they’re hoping for “is to minimize the infections, get it under control and to protect the health of campus and the community,” Smith said. The school began working to prepare for the fall semester shortly after classes went remote in the spring, said Martin Burke, a chemistry professor at the University of Illinois and chair of the SHIELD committee, the team that is guiding the university’s approach to reopening. They realized relatively quickly that in order to bring students back to campus, they would need to test frequently and get results back rapidly, something that wasn’t going to be possible with a nasal swab test. That led to what Burke described as a “Manhattan Project-style effort,” at the university  to develop their own test. Ultimately they were able to do so in about six weeks, he said. Now the school is working to expand access to the test to the rest of the state of Illinois and even to other areas of the country and around the world. “Testing is not a silver bullet, but it’s a very powerful component,” Burke said. In addition to the testing, the school developed an app where students, faculty and staff receive test results and reminders, and a boarding pass-style image indicating a negative COVID test that allow them access to campus buildings. Users can also enable the app to notify them when they’ve been in close proximity to someone who tested positive for COVID through the use of an anonymized Bluetooth scanning system. U of I is also taking many of the same steps as other campuses  — moving large lecture courses online, moving smaller in-person courses to large rooms to allow for social distancing and requiring masks. The school also has “every high expectation” of students, Jones said. “By agreeing to come back and be here that they have to take ownership to keep themselves safe.” Those who are participating in on-campus activities and don’t follow testing and isolation guidelines could be subject to student discipline. For a university to have a shot at reopening successfully, it needs to hold classes online or outside when possible, have a good system for testing and contact tracing, and have clear and transparent metrics for when it will change course, Salomon said. (Asked about what would trigger a move to remote instruction, Jones said “one of the key metrics, we’re keeping our eye on is the number of positive cases.”) All of these are costly  and administratively challenging undertakings. Jones said his best “guesstimate” is that the school’s testing component alone will cost $7 to $10 million per semester. But a major obstacle to any successful reopening, is just the status of the spread of the virus itself, Salomon said. “We’re still very much in the middle of a raging pandemic,” he said. “With that amount of transmission in communities and bringing together students from around the country, we know that there will be people infected upon arrival. It raises the bar on what needs to be done to interrupt transmission and cut it off.” During the first week of classes, when the school onboarded tens of thousands of students, “the main hiccup” in its system was turning test results around fast enough so that students, faculty and staff would have access to buildings they needed to be in for class, Smith said. Those who haven’t had a negative test result in the last four days can’t get into university buildings, except their own residence hall. Still, the school has been turning test results around “well within” the 48 hour window they’ve promised, she said. Workman was one of those affected by the hiccup. She got tested on a Monday, which was one of the testing days assigned to her by the school, but didn’t get her results back in time to teach her 8 a.m. Tuesday class in person. She “had to call an audible and tell my class we were meeting on Zoom.” When the two public speaking classes she was teaching started last week, roughly 5% of her students couldn’t attend because they’d tested positive for the virus, Workman said. That’s one metric Workman said she’ll be keeping an eye on as she evaluates whether to keep teaching in person. If enough students can’t attend class face-to-face because of quarantine or isolation, she’ll transition to remote instruction, though her preference is to continue teaching in-person classes — the widespread testing has made her feel comfortable doing so. Owen Stephenson was eager to come to campus for his freshman year to gain some independence, even if he would be taking most of his classes online. So far, he’s felt like the testing has gone smoothly; he received his first two test results on the same day he tested and his only quibble was a 45-minute wait on a weekend, when there are fewer testing tents available. The required testing is part of what makes Stephenson feel like he can keep himself safe, regardless of other students’ behavior. “Their testing is the only thing that sets them apart from other universities trying to go back,” he said of U of I’s plan. From her observations in class, Workman said it seems as if students are committed to making the school’s reopening program work because they want to stick around for the semester. Still, she said, the changes to the college experience required during this time — more rules for engaging on campus, more online courses than typical — have left her students so drained that she ended a recent class 20 minutes early. “They had this feeling that once they were finally able to get back on campus, that life would feel more normal and it’s not.” To be eligible for protection, renters will need to provide proof of their inability to pay rent because of the pandemic.

    "text": "This interview is the third in a series of conversations MarketWatch is conducting with some of the leading voices in the U.S. on the COVID-19 pandemic. Back in April, Dr. Dixie Harris and about 100 nurses and doctors from the Intermountain Healthcare hospital system in Utah flew to New York City to work in the region’s overburdened hospitals. Harris, a pulmonologist who studies e-cigarette vaping, worked for days in a row, caring for COVID-19 patients when the region’s local hospitals were overwhelmed. It was at Southside Hospital in Bay Shore, N.Y., that she started to learn about the virus, about why it’s better to put patients prone, why ventilators aren’t always the best option — and the importance of wearing a face mask. “One hundred of us went,” she said. “Zero came back positive.” Back home in the much more sparsely populated state of Utah, cases peaked at 876 on July 9, according to the Utah Department of Health. About 400 people in total have died as a result of a COVID-19 infection. (New York state has reported a total of 430,774 cases and 25,297 deaths as of Aug. 25.) As cases have declined, more of Harris’ focus has turned to patients who had COVID-19 in the spring and are still dealing with myriad health problems and symptoms months later. Many of these patients in the U.S. call themselves “long haulers.” They have reported fatigue, chest pain and neurological damage. “One of my first long-hauler patients had symptoms in March,” she said. “Five months later, and this patient was never in the hospital. That’s who I’m mostly seeing: patients who haven’t been in the hospital but continue to have ongoing symptoms.” Dr. Dixie Harris: We were there three weeks in April. It was pretty intense. It was right as the peak was going down, but there were still six times the number of ICU patients or more for the hospital I was working in. From what I could see, it hit pretty much within a week. It went from next to no COVID patients to overwhelming the whole system. I’ve had other people ask me, “Why didn’t they just ship some of those patients to another hospital?” Well, every hospital in Long Island was overrun with patients. And all the ambulances were so busy bringing new patients in, it’s not like they could say, “Oh, we’ll take this one patient all the way up to Albany. “ A tsunami is what they called it because there was no warning and it hit all at once. It was an incredibly dynamic learning environment. From when we started to when I left, care changed markedly. We were intubating early on. And then we said, “Wait a second, once they go on the ventilator, they’re on for three weeks. What can we do to avoid this?” The big key is proning. Even if you get some respiratory symptoms but you don’t have to be in the hospital, go ahead and move. Prone. Don’t just lay in the bed on your back at home. I will say it’s really hard to lay on your belly when your BMI is 45. When you’re really obese, it feels like you can’t breathe. So I tell the patients to sit up, lean forward. You’re trying to get the back upright. It was an honor to get to go there. The head of Northwell Health came when we were leaving about to get on the plane and came in to thank us. They did a water cannon salute in New York at the airport. When we were in the waiting area right at the jet way, probably 30, 40 people showed up and just gave us a shout-out clap. All wearing masks, all distanced. MarketWatch: It looks like Utah’s peak was in July. How is it different caring for patients there even now? Harris: We haven’t been overwhelmed. We have not had our ICUs completely full and so because of that we’re doing cutting edge best care possible. Every COVID patient is presented to infectious disease to decide which meds they qualify for. Harris: The laypeople are calling it long haulers. The British Medical Journal just did a nice review on management of post-acute COVID patients. They’re calling it long COVID. In the medical community, we haven’t fully named it. But I’m [also] aware of patients who consider themselves long haulers who have never (been) diagnosed positive for COVID. They feel they have it because they have the symptoms, the time frame, and all that. Harris: That’s really what we are just learning. Who I get are patients who two to three months later are still having shortness of breath, still having aches and pains, and maybe chest symptoms. Many of them are still on oxygen. Now mind you, we are at higher elevation. So some of these patients would not necessarily be hypoxic if they were at sea level. Still, these are people who are used to living here, so their body is adjusted to it. Dr. Kirk Knowlton, [Intermountain’s director of cardiovascular research, critical care physician Dr. Eliotte Hirshberg] and I are going to be talking to our leadership about developing protocols to take care of these patients. Part of it is to acknowledge that patients are still having symptoms. One of my first long-hauler patients had symptoms in March. I talked to the patient a week and a half ago, and he is still having a little bit of symptoms [but is] markedly better. Back to work now. But five months later, and this patient was never in the hospital. That’s who I’m mostly seeing: patients who haven’t been in the hospital but continue to have ongoing symptoms. In the BMJ article that just was published, they’re saying that 10% of patients who test positive remain unwell after three weeks. Their definition is if you have symptoms more than three weeks, you’re going into the long haulers. A lot of people are calling long haulers a month out. My colleague and I are presenting to our leadership — he’s a cardiologist, and I’m a pulmonologist — but we’re the ones who are aware of these cases two, three, four, or five months later. The fatigue and the memory issues. Depression. There’s a lot of non-pulmonary issues. Muscle aches. Anxiety. Everybody’s anxious in the day of COVID, right? Everybody’s stressed. Everybody’s had to adjust and learn. Primary care’s going to be addressing more and more of this. And our psychiatric services are going to be seeing this. My long haulers, most of them are on oxygen, and they all have pulmonary symptoms. But every time I see them, they’re a little bit better. I do see improvement over time. I will say that things such as prolonged symptoms — fatigue, that kind of thing — has been reported in MERS and SARS. MarketWatch: It’s not just a respiratory illness. Harris: Right. It’s a blood vessel illness. It’s a brain illness. It’s a muscle illness. MarketWatch: You’ve done some research around vaping and smoking. How do you talk to patients about these types of things in the context of COVID? Harris: It’s pretty well established that vaping nicotine does weaken the immune system. It especially affects how the nose can fight viruses. And how does COVID get in the system? Eyes, nose, mouth, right? You saw more cases of EVALI (e-cigarette, or vaping, product use associated lung injury) in April and May. A lot of the EVALI, like 90% to 95%, is due to the tainted THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) oil. [THC is the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis that makes people feel “high.”] I think people are going to THC with the stress of all the quarantines and all the changes. It makes sense people are reaching for that. Whatever you do, don’t vape the THC. This Q&A has been edited for clarity and length. • Dr. Osterholm: Americans will be living with the coronavirus for decades Zoom shares followed an astonishing earnings report with a stunning rally that has pushed the stock into uncharted territory.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-what-to-know-about-abbotts-15-minute-covid-19-test-11598982464?mod=home-page",
    "text": "On Aug. 26, the Food and Drug Administration granted an Emergency Use Authorization to a new rapid antigen test for COVID-19 called the BinaxNOW test. I study public health policy to combat infectious disease epidemics. Testing is one of the most powerful tools available to fight the spread of COVID-19. The new test is inexpensive, rapid and easy to use. It will massively scale up access to testing, but hurdles remain in achieving widespread, frequent COVID-19 testing. The credit-card-sized test is an antigen test that detects a specific viral protein from SARS-CoV-2. It costs $5 and doesn’t require a lab or a machine for processing. Performing the test is simple. A health-care worker or technician would use a swab to collect a sample from less than 1 inch inside the nostril. They would then combine the sample with a few drops of chemicals inside the test card. Within 15 minutes, the test strip would show a positive or negative result. The test is also paired with an app that produces a digital code that can be scanned to show proof of a recent negative COVID-19 test. The BinaxNOW test is currently only authorized for patients who have had COVID-19 symptoms for seven days or less, which is when virus levels in the body are likely to be high. It must be prescribed by a physician and performed by a trained technicianor other health-care worker. The PCR test for COVID-19 is currently widely used and considered the gold standard, but requires patient samples to be sent to a lab and can take days to provide results. The new antigen test is designed to be a cheap and quick alternative to PCR testing for diagnostic purposes in a medical setting. It would add critical capacity to an overstretched testing system. The emergency use authorization provides preliminary authorization for doctors to prescribe the antigen test while the full FDA approval process is ongoing. The authorization could be revoked if the test is not as accurate or reliable as expected. However, the true accuracy could be lower because the performance testing group was only 102 people and the accuracy hasn’t been validated by the FDA as part of the full approval process. There will inevitably be some false negatives and false positives with the BinaxNOW test since accuracy isn’t 100%, but the FDA will monitor the data to make sure the test meets the reported accuracy. The BinaxNOW test is cheap, rapid, able to be mass-produced and easy to use outside a lab. This makes it a promising candidate for widespread screening. However, the test is currently only authorized for people with COVID-19 symptoms. This is an obstacle because an estimated 40% of all COVID-19 cases are asymptomatic and these people likely don’t know that they’re contagious. To maximize the effectiveness of any COVID-19 screening program, it is important to test people whether they have symptoms or not. Health-care providers are able to prescribe the BinaxNOW test for asymptomatic patients for off-label use, but health officials don’t yet know how accurate the test is when performed on asymptomatic people. The massive expansion of testing access made possible by the BinaxNOW test will almost surely outweigh the downsides of a small number of inaccurate results. Abbott plans to manufacture 50 million tests per month starting in October. This will quickly exceed the 76 million COVID-19 tests the U.S. has performed over the last six months. Widespread, frequent testing is effective at slowing the spread of the coronavirus. The new testing capacity made possible by the authorization of this rapid antigen test represents a major advance in bringing the pandemic under control. Zoë McLaren is an associate professor of public policy at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. This was first published by The Conversation — “Will the new 15-minute COVID-19 test solve US testing problems?“ Shares of DocuSign Inc.  are up more than 16% in Tuesday morning trading after Zoom Video Communications Inc.  reported July-quarter results showing that it made more than four times as much revenue as it did a year ago. Zoom's earnings, which topped expectations, suggested that technologies enabling remote business functions are still seeing explosive growth due to the pandemic. DocuSign, which enables electronic signatures on legal documents, is due to report its own results after Thursday's closing bell. Shares of workplace-messaging company Slack Inc.  is also seeing its stock rise more than 3% in Tuesday's session. Zoom shares are up more than 45% in the session and they'e gained nearly 600% on the year as the S&P 500  has risen 8.6%. Copyright © 2020 MarketWatch, Inc. All rights reserved."

    "text": "U.S. stock futures climbed on Wednesday, pointed to potentially more records for Wall Street ahead of key labor market data, while European equities picked on the mood and got additional help as the euro ran out of steam. “Solid economic data out of the United States and China are giving investors hope that the global economy might recover faster than expected from the Covid-19 crisis. This is an important signal for markets, which have already priced in a lot of positive news,” Milan Cutkovic, market analyst at AxiCorp, told clients in a note. Investors are waiting on an August update from payroll provider ADP, which comes ahead of Friday’s bigger jobs report. Factory orders and the Federal Reserve Board's Beige Book are also ahead. Europe’s common currency eased after Philip Lane, chief economist at the European Central Bank, reportedly voiced concern over the euro-dollar rate. “If there are forces moving the euro-dollar rate around, that feeds into our global and European forecasts and that in turn does feed into our monetary policy setting,” Lane said in an online conference on Tuesday evening. The comments weren’t too surprising and the ECB will probably stick to verbal intervention instead of cutting rates, Gizem Kara, economist at BNP Paribas in London, told clients in a note. The economist said “risk-reward of cutting is not favorable right now” and if the market perceives the ECB has used up its firepower, the currency could even rise. The latest survey from Nationwide Building Society showed U.K. house prices rose by a seasonally adjusted 2% in August, the highest monthly rise since February 2004. Asian markets finished mixed, with gains led by a 1.8% rise for Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 and gains across most sectors. Data showed the country plunged into recession for the first time in 29 years. After a small pause Wednesday following a 5 day rally that added more than $500, or 36%, to the stock price, Tesla shares were on the move again. Copyright © 2020 MarketWatch, Inc.

    "text": "The coronavirus has hit India especially hard, with the country’s economy shrinking 24% in the June quarter—the worst since it began reporting quarterly data in 1996 and the hardest hit for a major economy from the pandemic so far. But even as India continues to grapple with the virus, strategists see opportunity in some Indian stocks. In late March, Prime Minister Narendra Modi instituted one of the world’s strictest lockdowns to deal with Covid-19, shutting down almost all nonessential parts of the economy. But the virus left its mark regardless, with 3.5 million confirmed cases and 60,000 reported deaths so far. The pandemic hit an economy that was already weak and whose banks were grappling with a nonperforming-loan problem. Indian stocks have recouped some of their losses since March, and UBS expects them to continue to outperform, with the potential for close to 15% more gains over the next six to 12 months—with an additional boost as the rupee possibly appreciates against the dollar by about 4.6% in the next year. Strategists at Pavilion Global also see opportunity but warn investors to be selective, in part because of the bounce since the March lows, with companies that get most of their sales domestically looking pricey. Covid-19 is also expected to increase Indian banks’ nonperforming loans to 14.7% from 8.5%, making the sector unappealing. Pavilion Global strategists in a recent client note suggested investors tilt toward “safer bet” sectors like health-care and technology stocks that get more of their revenue from abroad. Indian software and service companies, for example, will benefit from increasing demand for digital services. Earnings estimates for Indian tech companies have risen more than U.S. peers, and earnings in the recent quarter beat those more optimistic estimates, Pavilion Global strategists write. What’s more, Indian tech stocks trade at a roughly 40% discount to U.S. peers, they add. While many Indian companies are laden with debt, the tech sector has been reducing leverage, with total debt-to-Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) at just 0.4 times, significantly lower than global peers, the strategists add. Both tech and health-care companies in India have also not been tapping the market as aggressively as other companies in emerging markets that have been issuing shares in recent years, which has added to dilution in shareholder value.

    "title": "5 Midcap Dividend Stocks With Solid Yields—and Near-Term Paying Power",
    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/5-midcap-dividend-stocks-with-solid-yieldsand-near-term-paying-power-51599040801?mod=home-page",
    "text": "Midcap firms may not have the same global reach and cash-flow generation as many large-cap companies do, but there is yield to be had in that part of the market. The S&P Midcap 400 Index was recently yielding around 1.5%, compared with 1.6% for the large-cap proxy S&P 500, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Dividend stocks of any stripe look all the more enticing when compared with the 10-Year U.S. Treasury note, whose yield was recently at 0.695%. Despite dividend stocks’ solid yields, this hasn’t been an easy year for equity-income investors as many companies suspended or cut their payouts, especially in March and April when the Covid-19 pandemic began to take hold in the U.S. Tony DeSpirito, chief investment officer of U.S. fundamental active equity at BlackRock and the portfolio manager of the BlackRock Equity Dividend Fund (ticker: MDDVX), observed in a recent note that “these are unusual times, and dividend cuts are inevitable.” But he maintains that “many of the predictions for dividend cuts in this cycle [are] overly severe.” As for midcaps, “I do think it’s a promising area,” he tells Barron’s, adding that there are plenty of companies in that market cap range with good balance sheets and solid dividends. Note: data as of Aug. 31 For some ideas about midcap stocks, Barron’s ran a screen starting with the S&P Midcap 400 Index. As was the case with previous screens based on the S&P 500 and the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats, Barron’s divided the stocks into five groups, or quintiles. Those with the highest dividend yields were in the first quintile, and so on down the line. Barron’s homed in on the second quintile. The highest-yielding stocks, we figured, could be subject to dividend cuts. Remember that a high yield often signals poor stock performance. “We would be selective in investing in companies with the highest yields, which can be a red flag for a cut,” DeSpirito observed in his recent note. The second quintile still offers attractive yields and, in theory at least, more-stable underlying businesses. Barron’s selected five stocks from the 80 in the second quintile, having used a combination of factors to whittle down that list. Earnings durability is important, especially in a pandemic. We eschewed any companies whose 2020 profits are expected to fall sharply, their enticing yields notwithstanding. Second-quarter sales jumped 5% to just over $1 billion from a year earlier. “The flexibility of our bakery network has enabled us to continue serving our markets uninterrupted throughout the pandemic,” CEO Ryals McMullian told analysts during the company’s second-quarter earnings call in early August. Many bank stocks have come under pressure as investors worry about loan-loss reserves pressuring earnings. The company reported second-quarter profits of 66 cents a share, up from 61 cents a year earlier. Analysts polled by FactSet expect the company to earn $2.43 a share this year, up slightly from $2.38 in 2019. The company has a history of paying special dividends, most recently in January. At that time it paid out an extra 20 cents a share. Last month, the company said it will pay a quarterly dividend of 43 cents a share, in line with previous payouts. Despite the pandemic, One Gas’s earnings are holding reasonably steady. Analysts are expecting the gas distributor to earn $3.55 a share this year, compared with $3.51 in 2019. The company has maintained its quarterly dividend at 54 cents a share this year. The stock, which yields 3.1%, has returned around minus 12% year to date. The company has kept its quarterly dividend at 63 cents a share. The company’s global net sales fell 13% in the second quarter. Write to Lawrence C.

    "text": "The ISM’s latest monthly survey, released Tuesday, showed the quickest expansion in factory activity since November 2018. It was also the fourth consecutive month of growth in U.S. manufacturing. That is a good sign for investors who have been betting on an economic rebound from the coronavirus recession. And it looks as if the manufacturing recovery is global: Several countries reported similarly upbeat data on factory activity overnight. There are still some reasons to be cautious. Economists say that global manufacturing still hasn’t fully recovered from the slowdown, even after the months of improvement. And ISM also reports that the sector’s employment hasn’t improved nearly as much as its output. Natural gas prices soared almost 50% in August, for an 80% year-to-date gain. The steep increase in the price of natural gas has a few causes. First of all, it had a low starting point -- the prices of all types of energy tanked earlier this year, when people stopped traveling due to the pandemic. Second, as production slowed down, the slide in prices caused gas producers like Chesapeake Energy to file for bankruptcy. And third, gas prices jumped in the short term because more people have been generating their own electricity in California, where power companies have been shutting down power in some parts of the state to prevent wildfires. Prices could come down soon, though, because summer is almost over. Unless there are heat waves or more storms that interrupt supply, the end of summer means less air-conditioning and lower energy bills. The gains followed news that prominent hedge fund D.E. Shaw has taken on a new 5.2% stake in the company’s equity. Kodak shareholders have gone on a wild ride this year. The stock soared more than 600% to its peak back in July, after news that the government was planning to loan the company $765 million. It took the loan to expand into drug ingredient manufacturing -- a departure from the camera business the company was known for. The stock has dropped more than 80% since then, as investors learned the loan wasn’t a done deal. And any money Kodak gets from the government will need to be paid back. The optimism about D.E. Shaw’s investment might not last either. While the hedge fund sometimes takes on activist positions to jockey for improvements at a company, it doesn’t appear to be taking that approach with Kodak.

    "title": "Renters in U.S. cannot be evicted through the end of the year due to coronavirus, CDC order states",
    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/cdc-issues-nationwide-eviction-ban-through-the-end-of-the-year-in-an-effort-to-control-coronavirus-2020-09-01?mod=home-page",
    "text": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention implemented a temporary eviction moratorium through the end of the year, protecting U.S. renters from losing their homes during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Trump administration announced Tuesday. The CDC’s moratorium will apply to all rental units nationwide until Dec. 31 and goes into effect immediately, senior administration officials said of an unpublished CDC agency order. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told a U.S. House of Representatives panel Tuesday that the moratorium would cover around 40 million renters. Renters will be eligible for the moratorium’s protection if they received an economic impact payment, or stimulus check, as provided for by the CARES Act. Therefore, single renters must earn no more than $99,000 a year, while couples filing jointly can earn up to $198,000 annually. The order, which was shared ahead of being published in the Federal Register on Sept. 4, includes a declaration for renters to sign and give their landlord. Senior Trump administration officials said the form would be made available on the CDC’s website. Renters must indicate on the declaration that they cannot afford to pay their rent in full and that if evicted they would become homeless or force to move into congregate housing. Renters also must be able to prove that they made an effort to receive government assistance and that they could not afford rent. The moratorium does not absolve renters of paying the rent. That money is still due to landlords, and senior administration officials said that renters should still attempt to make partial payments when they cannot afford to pay in full. Landlords will still be permitted to evict tenants in certain cases, such as instances in which the tenant has destroyed property or poses a threat to the health or safety of neighbors. The moratorium builds on a previous executive order from President Donald Trump that directed the Department of Health and Human Services and the CDC to determine whether halting evictions was necessary to contain the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19. “In the context of a pandemic, eviction moratoria — like quarantine, isolation, and social distancing — can be an effective public health measure utilized to prevent the spread of communicable disease,” the CDC’s unpublished order said. “President Trump is committed to helping hardworking Americans stay in their homes and combating the spread of the coronavirus,” White House deputy press secretary Brian Morgenstern said during a briefing Tuesday. Housing advocates said the move was “long overdue,” but called for more help to be provided to renters facing financial difficulties amid historically high levels of unemployment caused by the pandemic. “As we have said for five months, the very least the federal government ought to do is assure each of us that we won’t lose our homes in the middle of a global pandemic: The administration’s action would do so and will provide relief from the growing threat of eviction for millions of anxious families,” said Diane Yentel, president and CEO of the National Low Income Housing Coalition. “But while an eviction moratorium is an essential step, it is a half-measure that extends a financial cliff for renters to fall off of when the moratorium expires and back rent is owed,” Yentel added, while calling on Congress to pass another COVID-19 relief bill with at least $100 billion in emergency rental assistance. Previously, some lawmakers and activists called for a cancellation of rent during the pandemic. Trump administration officials during Tuesday’s briefing said that renters and landlords would have access to emergency funds already in place, including billions of dollars in grants from the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the $142 billion coronavirus relief fund from the Treasury Department. Administration officials could not clarify whether the CDC moratorium would prevent eviction filings from occurring. Housing and legal advocates have raised concerns that landlords filed evictions against many people nationwide who should have been protected by the CARES Act moratorium.

    "title": "My father left me money for a house — and my husband put his name on the deed. How do I ensure it goes to our kids?",
    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/my-father-left-me-money-for-a-house-and-my-husband-put-his-name-on-the-deed-how-do-i-ensure-it-goes-to-our-kids-2020-09-02?mod=home-page",
    "text": "I have been married to my husband for 38 years and we have three children together. When his mother passed away, he received an inheritance of $8,000. My husband never told me about this money, and he spent all of it before I found out he even received his inheritance. When my father passed away, he intended that any inheritance we received would be kept in his own family, so naturally my inheritance was made out to me and me alone. I deposited the money into a checking account with just my name on it. The Moneyist: ‘A man cave on wheels’: My husband’s RV is his pride and joy — but he owes $75,000 on it. If he dies, am I liable? Within 30 days of receiving my inheritance, I purchased a home with the proceeds, and my husband talked me into putting his name on the deed. The check given to the seller’s attorney was a cashier’s check with my name alone. If I die before my husband, is it possible to put the house into a living trust given that my father’s intent was to keep the money within the family, and not my married husband’s family? I want this home to be an inheritance for our children, and I don’t want him to sell it as soon as I die. I wish to make sure that he doesn’t sell it or rent it out in his lifetime. I would like him to live there until he dies. He has paid for a couple of renovations to the home. How would I go about making sure that my kids will have this home as an inheritance, assuming I predecease my husband? A.G. Dear A.G., What’s his is his — and what’s yours belongs to both of you. What happens to your property if you predecease your husband, which is obviously not a given, depends on the kind of ownership you share. If you have “tenancy by entirety” or “joint tenancy with right of survivorship” then your husband will inherit your half of the home. If you have “tenancy in common,” then you will be able to bequest your half to someone else, in this case your kids. If you had bought this property alone with the money you inherited from your father, it’s typically deemed separate property in a community-property state (Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin). Inheritance is usually separate property. But if you use marital funds to improve the property, it becomes community or marital property. The Moneyist: My mother’s will says her boyfriend can live in her home after she dies. Can I still kick him out if the deed is transferred to me? But it’s different in separate-property states in most cases where there are no extenuating circumstances. “In a separate property state, one spouse can hold property without having the other spouse on title, and the other spouse would not have any right to that property,” says Kimberly Hanlon, co-founder of Lucere Legal in Minneapolis. “In the case of a divorce, the court will sometimes look at the proportionate share of contribution when determining how to split up the asset, in which case her contribution in the initial purchase would be weighed against his contribution in the improvements,” she adds. Probate court also considers whether it’s a separate asset, joint asset, and a prenuptial agreement can change it again. The Moneyist:My husband and I are worth $3.7 million, but I’m afraid I’ll spend my way into the poor house if he dies. When I was single, I bounced checks. What can I do? In some separate-property states, the surviving spouse has statutory rights to a certain percentage of their deceased spouse’s estate and/or rights in the marital homestead, Hanlon says. “Minnesota is like that. However, the surviving spouse may consent to waive those rights, either in advance — while their spouse still lives — or after the death.” You don’t say where you live, but your husband seemed to know what he was doing: not putting his name on the deed and using marital funds to renovate the home. The good news is the opposite is also true if he predeceases you. But let’s hope that doesn’t happen and you have many more than your 38 years left. If you do receive another inheritance, don’t let anyone talk you into anything.

    "text": "At the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, close to eight of 10 MBA students say they are not excited about the coming fall semester because the coronavirus pandemic has forced classes online. At UCLA’s Anderson School of Management, newly admitted international students are outraged that they cannot defer their admission to the school’s MBA program even if they cannot get a student visa to come to the U.S. At New York University’s Stern School of Business, students are demanding the reversal of a 3.5% increase in MBA tuition during COVID-19 and asking for a 5% to 10% discount on the price of their degrees because of the shift to virtual classes. Add to all of the anxiety and frustration the fact that some graduates from the most prestigious business schools, including Harvard and Stanford universities, saw their summer internships and full-time job offers clawed back by companies due to the COVID recession. Many more are deeply worried about their prospects for landing a job over the next year as still more companies freeze budgets and hiring plans. So is this a time to apply to an MBA program and go even further into debt? You better believe it is, and here’s why. A recession and a health crisis, no matter how severe, will not last forever. But while it lasts, many will find their opportunities to advance at work diminished or completely curtailed. Many more have already found themselves on unemployment. By the time this year’s incoming MBA students graduate in 2023, it is almost a certainty that both COVID-19 and the economic downturn will be in the rearview mirror. The Class of 2023 will inevitably graduate into a fully recovered economy, better prepared to take full advantage of the upturn. No less crucial, they will have been the beneficiaries of not merely the business basics or of the leadership development a strong MBA program provides; they will be steeped in both data analytics, specifically how to smartly harness massive datasets for decision making, and how to leverage new technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, to gain important efficiencies in a business moving forward. Of all the graduate degrees you could earn, an MBA from a highly selective business school is pretty much a no-brainer investment. The top five schools for average starting pay last year — base salary plus signing bonus — are all big names, led by the Wharton School at $172,016, NYU Stern ($168,291), Stanford ($168,226), Dartmouth College’s Tuck School of Business ($166,251), and the University of Virginia’s Darden School of Business ($165,292). In all, 12 schools in the top 25 of U.S. News’s MBA ranking report starting salaries above $160,000, and 17 above $150,000. “If you stayed at work in 2021, your career options and earning potential in 2023 would be more limited if you had gone to business school,” noted Soojin Kwon, managing director of full-time MBA admissions and program at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business. Why? Kwon notes that students will gain three advantages by going back to school that they won’t get by staying in a job during the pandemic. “One, you’ll meet with and learn from hundreds of smart, ambitious and interesting people you wouldn’t have met if you didn’t go to business school,” Kwon said at a recent panel discussion for Poets & Quants.  “Two, you’re going to learn how to network and interview for jobs in an industry or function that you’re interested in going into, and most, if not all MBA recruiters this year are planning to do virtual recruiting. So you’re going to learn how to interview in the format in which recruiters are going to be recruiting. In addition, she said, “You’re going to gain access to a network of tens of thousands of business school alumni and hundreds of thousands of alumni in the broader university community. You could absolutely find another job through LinkedIn, but it’s no secret that you’re more likely to get a response if you have some kind of connection, and an MBA from a top school with the support of alumni provides that invaluable connection for life.” During the Great Recession of 2008-2009, the job situation was just as miserable and prospects for many MBAs appeared so dim that some openly questioned their decision to borrow money to get the degree. Robert Bruner, then dean of the University of Virginia’s Darden School of Business, found himself having to defend the value of the MBA. He rose to the challenge, and his points then made much sense now. Education adds significant value to human potential. “Generally, research finds real rates of return on investment upwards of 10% and as high as 50%. And there is a correlation between years in school and earning power but that’s only the quantitative part. Every year, students graduate who are more self-confident, better communicators, and more promising leaders than when they enrolled. And they have joined an alumni network that has helped in good times and bad.” Indeed, long-term thinking beats short-term thinking all the time. Young professionals have a long career ahead of them. “With the benefits of modern medicine, you can probably look forward to a career of 50 years,” Bruner wrote. “Are you judging the worth of an MBA by only the first job you get out of B-school? Take the long view. If you could discount the marginal benefits of an MBA from a competitive school over the next 50 years, I’d guess that they well exceed the costs. Don’t discount the future too steeply.” Truth is, you can bet with certainty that tough times will again appear once this pandemic is under control and the economy recovers. The ability to assess and bear sensible risks is the core of business and entrepreneurship. Pursuing a graduate degree in business to learn valuable skills, cultivate one’s leadership potential, and acquire a supportive network of connected professionals is a risk worth taking. John A.

    "text": "A record-setting August for stocks has set the bar high, but September may be off to an upbeat start, led by technology. That brings us to our call of the day from Schwab Center for Financial Research’s vice president of trading and derivatives, Randy Frederick, who thinks the stock market may finally deliver on some much-needed corrections. “We haven’t had anything of that nature at all since going all the way back to early June, when we had that big drop-off. We’re clearly way overdue on that,” Frederick said. And while 3,700 sounds “pretty remarkable from a bottom-of-the-virus return,” on a year-to-date basis that 14% gain for the S&P 500 is fairly average, he noted. When those smallish pullbacks come along, though, he advises against panic (he urged no panic in early March too), saying “they will be and should be used as buying opportunities.” That is  because there is nowhere else for investors to put their money as any Federal Reserve interest rate increase is years out, said Frederick. And investors should learn from those who panicked out of the market in 2008 and missed out on an 11-year bull market, he added. One potential correction trigger is technical, as he says 2020 has been closely tracking the action in 2009. That year saw three pullbacks — 3.5%, 4.3% and 5.6% in the last few months of 2009 — as his chart shows: A “substantial pullback in earnings could also trigger a pullback,” he said, noting that second-quarter S&P 500 earnings per share came in far better than expected. Frederick is watching the coronavirus pandemic as a potential trigger, with schools opening across the country and the potential for a dramatic uptick in the case count spooking markets, while trade issues with China shouldn’t be dismissed, as they also have the power to unhinge markets. Another stick of dynamite for stocks is continued wrangling over enhanced unemployment benefits in the U.S. “That’s a big issue that needs to be resolved on what they should do to support workers and small business going forward,” said Frederick.

    "title": "Only 19% of Tesla analysts say buy the stock while investors remain ‘insatiable’",
    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/only-19-of-tesla-analysts-say-buy-the-stock-while-investors-remain-insatiable-2020-09-01?mod=home-page",
    "text": "There is an old Wall Street saying that investing isn’t about being right or wrong, it’s about making money. No one understands that better than an investor in Tesla Inc.’s stock. The financial fundamentals and the historical valuations of earnings suggest the market is wrong about the electric vehicle (EV) maker’s stock price, according to the overwhelming majority of Tesla analysts. But the stock keeps rising and Tesla investors keep making money. No one is making more money than Elon Musk, Tesla’s chief executive officer, largest shareholder and arguably its most important cheerleader, who just became the third-richest person in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak, who has been bearish on Tesla since Jan. 23 2019, when the stock closed at $57.52, put it this way in a note to clients: Spak raised his price target to $290 from $170, but his target was still 42% below Monday’s closing price. See related: His short position just got ‘obliterated,’ but this Tesla bear isn’t giving up. Also read: Tesla takes advantage of stock’s best month in 7 years with $5 billion offering. There are some fundamental reasons for investors being right to buy, as Tesla has been profitable for four straight quarters, while Wall Street was wrong to expect losses in three of the past four quarters. And despite concerns about the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, Tesla delivered way more EVs than expected during the second quarter. While the 5-for-1 stock split Tesla announced on Aug. 11 didn’t improve the company’s fundamentals in any way, investors were right to buy or hold on to their shares, for now, as the price has charged up more than 80% since the announcement through Monday. Read more: Tesla stock rally accelerates further into record territory after split takes effect. Despite such strong investor conviction, 81% of analysts don’t recommend buying. Of the 36 analysts surveyed by FactSet, only seven, or 19%, have the equivalent of buy ratings on Tesla’s stock. And only one of those analysts, Jefferies’s Philippe Houchois, had a price target — $500 — that was above Monday’s closing price. Meanwhile, half the analysts had the equivalent of hold ratings and 11 analysts, or 31%, had the equivalent of sell ratings. The average price target of all the analysts was $261.85, according to FactSet, which implied a 47% drop from Monday’s closing price. Most of what analysts have been wrong about Tesla has taken place over roughly the past five months. At the end of March, when the COVID-19 crisis was full blown, there were the same number of bearish analysts as there are now and the average stock price target was $101.86, just 2.8% below the March 31 closing price of $104.80. With the stock’s gain since then, Tesla’s market capitalization increased to $464.3 billion as of Monday’s close, which was the seventh highest among U.S. companies. RBC’s Spak suggested that what may also keep supporting the stock is that given the sheer market valuation of Tesla, many portfolio managers have to add to positions “just to keep pace.” He also believes investors have been willing to show more patience and look further into the future to value the stock. “We still view Tesla as fundamentally overvalued and having to grow into its valuation,” Spak wrote. Spak recognizes that Tesla is clearly ahead of its competition, has relatively inexpensive access to capital, the ability to attract talent, an “incredible” brand, and understands that “narrative, momentum and other factors” can impact the stock price. But he still believes that ultimately, a company’s value is related to fundamental factors. Basically, he’s suggesting that one of the biggest risk factors to Tesla’s stock isn’t good or bad fundamental news, but how investors value that news. The next major potential news catalyst is Tesla’s “battery day” scheduled for Sept. 22, of which Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said recently he’s expecting a number of potential “game changing” developments. One of those developments is the “million mile” battery, which in theory will support an EV for 1 million miles, which could put Tesla miles ahead of its traditional gasoline-powered automotive competitors. That said, Ives is one of the analysts that doesn’t recommend buying — he’s at hold — while his price target of $380 suggests the stock could fall 24%. For those looking for actual fundamental risks, the following are just some of those included in the more than 20 pages of “risk factors” Tesla lists in its latest quarterly report filed on July 28. So far, those risks haven't mattered to Tesla investors. • “We are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer.” • “We have been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by the global COVID-19 pandemic, the duration and economic, governmental and social impact of which is difficult to predict, which may significantly harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.” • “We have experienced in the past, and may experience in the future, delays or other complications in the design, manufacture, launch, and production ramp of our vehicles, energy products, and product features, or may not realize our manufacturing cost targets, which could harm our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.” • “Our future growth and success is dependent upon consumers’ willingness to adopt electric vehicles and specifically our vehicles. We operate in the automotive industry, which is generally susceptible to cyclicality and volatility.” • “Any issues or delays in meeting our projected timelines, costs and production at or funding the ramp of Gigafactory Shanghai, or any difficulties in generating and maintaining local demand for vehicles manufactured there, could adversely impact our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition.” • “If our vehicles or other products that we sell or install fail to perform as expected, our ability to develop, market and sell our products and services could be harmed.” • “The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and we may not be successful in competing in these industries. We currently face competition from new and established domestic and international competitors and expect to face competition from others in the future, including competition from companies with new technology.” Shares of General Electric Co.  dropped 4.3% in afternoon trading Monday, after J.P. Morgan analyst Stephen Tusa withdrew his price target, saying he's now \"more negative\" on the industrial conglomerate heading into the back-half of 2020. Tusa's price target was $5, which was tied for the lowest of the 21 analysts surveyed by FactSet, while he kept his rating at neutral. He said the fact that management has stopped short of calling for for positive free cash flow (FCF) during the second half of the year, despite Wall Street expectations of a V-shaped recovery that has FCF in \"solidly positive\" territory, is an \"indirect way of acknowledging remaining headwinds.\" Based on a FactSet survey of analysts, FCF is expected to improve to about negative $902.5 million in the third quarter and to positive $1.27 billion in the fourth quarter; it was negative $2.1 billion the second quarter. In the second-quarter post-earnings call with analysts, Chief Executive Larry Culp said FCF would improve sequentially in the second-half of 2020, then turn positive in 2021. \"Unlike peers, GE continues to have no official guidance, which in our view implies difficulty seeing 3-6 months out, while debt maturities and options resets suggest GE does not see normal until '24.\" The stock has tumbled 43.3% year to date, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average  has slipped 0.2%.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/massachusetts-voters-to-decide-bitter-markey-kennedy-primary-fight-2020-09-01?mod=home-page",
    "text": "BOSTON — U.S. Sen. Edward Markey of Massachusetts defeated U.S. Rep. Joe Kennedy III in Tuesday’s hard-fought Democratic primary, harnessing support from progressive leaders to overcome a challenge from a younger rival who is a member of America’s most famous political family. It was the first time a Kennedy has lost a race for Congress in Massachusetts. Markey appealed to voters in the deeply Democratic state by positioning himself as aligned with the liberal wing of the party. He teamed up with a leading progressive, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, on the Green New Deal climate change initiative — and at one point labeled Kennedy “a progressive in name only.” That helped Markey overcome the enduring power of the Kennedy name in Massachusetts. The 39-year-old congressman sought to cast the 74-year-old Markey as someone out of touch after spending decades in Congress, first in the House before moving to the Senate. Kennedy said Tuesday night that the results aren’t the ones he’d hoped for, but pledged to work for Markey’s reelection. “The senator is a good man. You never heard me say otherwise,” Kennedy told supporters at an outdoor rally. Kennedy also suggested that the movement of supporters the campaign pulled together would continue past the current election. “We may have lost the final vote count tonight but we built a coalition that will endure,” he said. “I would this again with all of you in a heartbeat.” In the waning weeks of the campaign, Kennedy leaned into his family’s long political legacy in Massachusetts. His pedigree includes former President John F. Kennedy; former U.S. Senator and U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, his grandfather; and former U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy, who held a Senate seat in Massachusetts for nearly half a century until his death in 2009. Markey countered by leaning into his own family story — growing up in the working class city of Malden with a father who drove a truck for the Hood Milk company. In one campaign video, Markey also paraphrased a famous JFK quote, saying, “We asked what we could do for our country. We went out, we did it. With all due respect, it’s time to start asking what your country can do for you.” Markey also found himself on the defense at times during the campaign, with Kennedy repeatedly trying to portray him as having a tin ear to racial equity concerns. Kennedy faulted Markey for his initial opposition to the effort to desegregate the Boston Public Schools beginning in the 1970s. Markey countered by noting that he changed his views on the contentious issue that tore at the fabric of the city. He also said he supported the creation in 1973 of a state Senate seat aimed at helping elect a Black senator to the Massachusetts Legislature. Kennedy also repeatedly pointed to the father of Danroy “DJ” Henry, a young Black man from Massachusetts killed by police 10 years ago. Henry’s father has criticized Markey, saying he failed to help the family seek justice. Markey said he has apologized to the Henry family and signed a letter seeking a federal Justice Department investigation into the killing. Markey also wasn’t shy about talking about the Kennedy family, at one point pressing Kennedy to tell his father — former U.S. Rep. Joe Kennedy ll — to stop supporting a political action committee that was running ads against Markey. “I’m sure your father is watching right now,” Markey said. “Tell your father right now that you don’t want money to go into a super PAC that runs negative ads.” Kennedy said he had “no idea” if his father was helping fund the PAC. Late in the race, Kennedy also landed a major endorsement when Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi formally backed his candidacy. While Markey, who served with Pelosi in the House for decades, congratulated Kennedy, Pelosi’s decision angered some of Markey’s younger progressive supporters. Markey had earlier won the endorsement of Ocasio-Cortez and fellow Massachusetts Democratic U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren. “Ed Markey wasn’t afraid. He offered his expertise & partnership. He wasn’t scared of big policy & didn’t use kid gloves. It’s great to watch him overcome the odds and win tonight,” Ocasio-Cortez tweeted Tuesday night. The coronavirus upended the way both candidates could reach out to voters — severely limiting more traditional means of electioneering like knocking on doors, shaking hands or holding big rallies. Instead, the campaigns were largely waged online with virtual rallies, virtual endorsements, virtual fundraisers and virtual roundtable events to discuss issues. Eventually, as Massachusetts began to suppress the virus and emerge from a near lockdown, the candidates began to take their campaigns on the road — with appropriate social distancing rules and face masks in tow. The showdown drew criticism from some Democrats nationally who feared it would siphon time and money away from the primary goals of defeating President Donald Trump and winning back control of the Senate, It also wasn’t cheap, with both Kennedy and Markey raising millions to pay for campaign staff, television and digital ads and old-school campaign flyers. Markey now faces a general election contest where he is considered a strong favorite in a district that has historically elected Democrats. He’ll face the winner of the Republican primary, Kevin O’Connor, in November. Do masks really work? Ask the dozens of Starbucks customers who tested positive for COVID-19 in Seoul earlier this month after a woman with coronavirus sat under an air-conditioner in the cafe.

    "text": "So much for playing videogames to escape reality — the 2020 U.S. presidential election has now even infiltrated “Animal Crossing.” Yes, the millions of people playing “Animal Crossing: New Horizons” since it was released for the Nintendo Switch in March, in which players build their own virtual islands populated by cute critters, can now add Joe Biden campaign signs to their digital front yards. Biden’s presidential campaign revealed its “Animal Crossing” partnership on Tuesday. “Show your Biden/Harris pride virtually!” it declared on its official campaign store, along with QR codes for players to scan and add the free political insignia all over their islands. The designs include the official Biden-Harris logo, a Team Joe logo, a “Joe” Pride logo, as well as a print of three aviator sunglasses in red, white and blue. “’Animal Crossing’ is a dynamic, diverse, and powerful platform that brings communities together from across the world,” Christian Tom, director of digital partnerships for the Biden campaign, said in a statement. “It is an exciting new opportunity for our campaign to engage and connect Biden-Harris supporters as they build and decorate their islands.” And the virtual campaign signs fit into the Biden camp’s pandemic playbook of hosting more online events, live-streamed fundraisers and speeches, while Trump has continued to campaign in person. Reps from Nintendo did not immediately respond to a MarketWatch query about whether the Biden campaign had to pay for those virtual signs to be available in the “Animal Crossing” game. Trump’s reelection campaign has not officially created campaign signs or T-shirts for “Animal Crossing,” although players can make their own — and in fact, have already done so. There are Trump and MAGA insignia on many individuals’ islands. CNN noted that, so far, there actually appear to be a few dozen more “MAGA” and “Trump” designs created by “Animal Crossing” gamers than Biden designs. Trump campaign deputy national press secretary Samantha Zager mocked Biden’s videogame gambit on Tuesday. “This explains everything: Joe Biden thinks he’s campaigning for president of ‘Animal Crossing’ from his basement,” she told CNN. “The Trump campaign will continue to spend its resources campaigning in the real world with real Americans.” Many people on social media also groaned at the Biden campaign’s “Animal Crossing” signs, as well, recalling Hillary Clinton calling on voters to “Pokemon Go to the polls” while she was running against Trump in 2016, citing another Nintendo gaming title. This isn’t the first time that political movements have made a mark in “Animal Crossing,” however. Players have also added Black Lives Matter flags and T-shirts to the game. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is getting heat over a solo hair salon visit in San Francisco at a time when California businesses are limited by concern over coronavirus.

    "text": "That’s Mohamed El-Erian,  Allianz’s chief economic adviser,  explaining in an op-ed for the Financial Times how action in the options pits should be taken as a warning by retail investors who have been cashing in on the stock market’s relentless push higher in recent months. “The seemingly endless rally… gives the impression that prices are endorsed and supported by the entire professional investment community,” he said.  “After all, despite the vocal concerns over valuations having split away from underlying corporate and economic fundamentals, few fund managers have been willing to challenge the market by placing outright shorts. “ However, “sophisticated investors” are expressing their cautious views with the use of derivatives, and El-Erian says the mom-and-pop types should take note. “Much of this could be seen as market deepening were it not for one troubling fact: corporate and economic fundamentals have yet to reflect a sustained and convincing recovery from COVID-related damage,” he said. The rebound in consumption is slowing, initial jobless claims are back to the 1 million level for a second straight week, bankruptcies are rising, and, according to El-Erian, it’s looking like these short-term disruptions are about to become long-term scars. “Rather than a well-thought-out bet on the future, stocks reflect many investors’ resolute faith in a consistently favourable and predictable liquidity environment,” he wrote. “It is a backdrop anchored by reliable stimulus from central banks.” On the surface, the same can pretty much be said for what we’re seeing in the derivatives market, but there’s more to it than just that. “The fear of missing out on an unceasing equity rally has increasingly been expressed through call options,” El-Erian said. “Those who would normally short the market on concerns of excessive valuations appear to have no desire to be steamrollered once again by favourable liquidity and the strong ‘buy-the-dip’ conditioning that comes with that.” “It would take a big shock for markets to move significantly lower — such as a renewed sharp economic downturn, a considerable monetary or fiscal policy mistake, or market defaults and liquidity accidents,” he wrote. “But should such a move occur, the likelihood of further market turmoil would be high, especially given the current lack of a short base to buffer the downturn. This exposes small retail investors to big potential losses.” The usually clean comic dropped several f-bombs online during Trump’s Republican convention speech.

    "text": "A record-setting August for stocks has set the bar high, but September may be off to an upbeat start, led by technology. That brings us to our call of the day from Schwab Center for Financial Research’s vice president of trading and derivatives, Randy Frederick, who thinks the stock market may finally deliver on some much-needed corrections. “We haven’t had anything of that nature at all since going all the way back to early June, when we had that big drop-off. We’re clearly way overdue on that,” Frederick said. And while 3,700 sounds “pretty remarkable from a bottom-of-the-virus return,” on a year-to-date basis that 14% gain for the S&P 500 is fairly average, he noted. When those smallish pullbacks come along, though, he advises against panic (he urged no panic in early March too), saying “they will be and should be used as buying opportunities.” That is  because there is nowhere else for investors to put their money as any Federal Reserve interest rate increase is years out, said Frederick. And investors should learn from those who panicked out of the market in 2008 and missed out on an 11-year bull market, he added. One potential correction trigger is technical, as he says 2020 has been closely tracking the action in 2009. That year saw three pullbacks — 3.5%, 4.3% and 5.6% in the last few months of 2009 — as his chart shows: A “substantial pullback in earnings could also trigger a pullback,” he said, noting that second-quarter S&P 500 earnings per share came in far better than expected. Frederick is watching the coronavirus pandemic as a potential trigger, with schools opening across the country and the potential for a dramatic uptick in the case count spooking markets, while trade issues with China shouldn’t be dismissed, as they also have the power to unhinge markets. Another stick of dynamite for stocks is continued wrangling over enhanced unemployment benefits in the U.S. “That’s a big issue that needs to be resolved on what they should do to support workers and small business going forward,” said Frederick.

    "text": "Asia-Pacific markets were mixed in early trading Wednesday, after Wall Street hit more records and Australia confirmed it was in its first recession in 29 years. “A positive tone had been assumed by Asia markets, finding inspiration from Wall Street with the gains notched overnight,” said Jingyi Pan, market strategist at IG in Singapore, said in a commentary. “Although the U.S. economy is nowhere near the state before the COVID-19 hit yet, these evidences of continued recovery nevertheless works in the favor of keeping the cautious optimism and the equity rally going.” Data showed Australia’s economy shrank 7% in the second quarter, after slipping 0.3% in the previous quarter, marking its first back-to-back periods of contraction — the widely recognized signifier of recession — since 1991. The massive downturn, caused by coronavirus-related shutdowns, has been softened by record fiscal stimulus to keep businesses open and workers paid. In other economic data, South Korea’s inflation hit a five-month high, gaining 0.7% in August, its fastest growth since March and outpacing analysts’ expectations.

    "title": "Rocket Reports Earnings Tomorrow. What to Expect.",
    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/rocket-reports-earnings-tomorrow-what-to-expect-51598999503?mod=home-page",
    "text": "Since its public offering, Rocket’s shares (ticker: RKT) have risen 38%, helped by the company’s preliminary second-quarter earnings released in mid-August as part of financial disclosures to bondholders. The company reported net revenue of $5 billion, a 437% increase from the same quarter in 2019, and adjusted Ebitda, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, of $3.8 billion, up 868% from the second quarter last year, the company said in a press release, owing to an elevated gain on sale margin as well as an increase in rate-lock volume. The company will report its official second-quarter earnings on Wednesday. Analysts anticipate generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) earnings of $1.39 per share on sales of $5.3 billion and Ebitda of $3.8 billion. Here are three things analysts are looking for. Bank vs. Tech Even before the company priced its IPO, there were debates about whether investors should value Rocket as a tech company or a mortgage originator. “On one hand, the value of their tech platform and ability to disrupt is significant,” writes Wells Fargo analysts Donald Fandetti, Michael Kaye, and Steven DeBartolo, who initiated coverage at the equivalent of Neutral with a price target of $29. “On the other hand, almost all of their revenue is from mortgage gain on sale which is volatile.” While analysts see the opportunity for Rocket, already the biggest player in the mortgage origination game, to secure a greater share in a highly-fragmented market using its proprietary digital platform, that market itself is highly cyclical, which could cut into earnings when sky-high refinance volumes return to earth. In its preliminary report, the company attributed its second-quarter growth in earnings to increased demand for mortgages and capacity constraints in the industry, which drove a 5.19% gain on sale margin, up from 3.22% over the same period in 2019. Looking farther ahead, analysts expect earnings per share of $3.16 for 2020 and $1.46 for 2021 according to FactSet, as capacity constraints decrease and Rocket’s currently elevated gain on sale margin falls. The second quarter “represented almost the perfect confluence of events” for an elevated high gain on sale margin, JP Morgan analysts write, citing falling rates, originator capacity constraints due to the surge in volume, and heightened demand for mortgage-backed securities due to Federal Reserve actions. “While we would normally expect [gain on sale margins] to remain between 3 and 4%, RKT generated a blended gain on sale of [5.19%], a level that is unlikely to be repeated within our modeled horizon.” “Origination volumes and margins are difficult to forecast given dependence on rates and competitor behavior,” writes a team of analysts led by Jason Kupferberg at BofA, who initiated at Buy with a $32 price target. Investors saw this sensitivity to rates play out in mid-August after government-sponsored entities Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac announced a 50 basis-point fee on refinances. Rocket shares fell 6.3% on the news, which critics warned would stymie refinance volume in the long-term and compel originators to cover the fee for locked-in borrowers in the short-term. The implementation of that fee has since been delayed until December. Even as analysts worry about Rocket’s exposure to mortgage rates, they see the company’s tech platform as well-positioned for growth. Rocket Mortgage’s first-quarter market share of the mortgage industrywas 9.2%, according to documents filed with the SEC, which the company aims to grow to 25% in 10 years, CEO Jay Farner said previously. “The biggest question mark in our model is how RKT deploys the significant amounts of capital generated in the coming quarters,” write a team of Barclays analysts led by Mark C. DeVries, indicating that the company is likely to reinvest a portion of returns into building its tech platform. Barclays initiated coverage at Neutral with a price target of $25. “Management suggested that there were some smaller opportunities on the horizon from an M&A perspective, and we get the sense that potential deals would focus on the real estate technology market over origination sensitive opportunities.” Analysts see the expansion of this program as key in the growth of market share. “Although a lower margin business, Partner Network volumes represent attractive business for Rocket as it brings additional customers into the servicing portfolio, where Rocket will have a chance to recapture future refinances on the mortgage,” the Barclays team wrote. A team of BofA analysts led by Jason Kupferberg also sees an expansion of Rocket’s partner network as a boon for growth. The analysts, who rate RKT shares a Buy with a price target of $32, noted that, while the partner network generates lower gain-on-sale margins, client acquisition costs are also lower. The company’s press release announcing preliminary results did not report direct-to-consumer and partner network segments separately, so Wednesday’s report will be the first look at both segments’ second-quarter performance. It’s a great time to be a mortgage originator with Rocket’s business model. The housing market’s recovery has seen demand for purchase mortgages and refinance loans remain elevated above 2019 levels for months. While some originators may struggle to match recent surging demand, Rocket is able to scale because of its tech platform, analysts say. “We believe RKT’s tech platform allows them to seamlessly handle spikes in volume, where many peer banks hit a capacity ceiling,” Wells Fargo analysts wrote. Rocket’s digital model also allows it to take advantage of another trend in the market, analysts write: digital-first millennials. “Rocket is well-positioned to take advantage of favorable demographic trends as millennials enter peak home purchasing age and expect a digital mortgage process,” write a team of J.P. Morgan analysts led by Richard Shane who initiated coverage at Neutral with a price target of $31. The surge of millennials in the market is one of two catalysts for short-term growth, wrote a RBC team led by Daniel R. Perlin who rate the company’s shares Outperform with a price target of $32. “U.S. demographics are on Rocket’s side, as millennials represent ~40% of new home buyers and rely heavily on technology for the buying process,” they wrote. That’s not the only demographic Rocket could cater to. RBC identified another near-term catalyst for the stock: nearly $11 trillion in mortgage debt outstanding from current homeowners that would benefit from refinancing at lower rates.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/tesla-raising-cash-not-your-typical-stock-offering-51598973302?mod=home-page",
    "text": "The company plans to use cash to “further strengthen our balance sheet, as well as for general corporate purposes,” according to the prospectus. That is standard language. More specifically, Tesla (ticker: TSLA) might use the money to build additional manufacturing capacity. Its next plant is planned for Austin, Texas. Currently, Tesla has facilities in California, Nevada, and Shanghai, as well as one under construction in Berlin. The company wasn’t immediately available to comment on future capacity plans. The offering is a little different than other stock sales. “At the market” means “investors who purchase shares in this offering at different times will likely pay different prices.” There is no one block of stock being allocated by bookrunners. That is a bad sign to some. GLJ analyst Gordon Johnson believes it’s a sign that institutional demand is drying up for Tesla stock, and that retail investors are driving the offering. “If they need the cash, that’s a problem with the story,” Johnson tells Barron’s. It’s a bearish take, but Johnson is indeed a bear. He rates Tesla Sell and has a mere $17.40 price target, the lowest target price on Wall Street for a stock that trades around $500. Not everyone feels as Johnson does. New Street Research analyst Pierre Ferragu is fine with the capital raise. “At these levels, it is more or less free money,” Ferragu tells Barron’s. It’s a good idea to raise capital when companies can get it. “Why not raise $20 billion?” asks Ferragu rhetorically. “They don’t want to upset their shareholders either.” The amount being raised is a fraction of Tesla’s market value. The dilution, according to the analyst, is easy for the market to digest. Ferragu rates shares Hold, with a price target of $300. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives rates shares Hold too, with a $380 price target. Ives falls on the side of Ferragu, believing the raise is a good idea. “This is the smart move at the right time for Musk & Co. after the parabolic rally in shares,” wrote Ives in a Tuesday research report. The entire EV sector, in fact, is on fire. The EV stocks Barron’s tracks are up more than 300% year to date on average. The rally has been catalyzed, in large part, because of Tesla’s success. The company has produced a string of better-than-expected delivery and earnings results, propelling shares higher. EV technology has made great gains recently—a fact reflected in stock prices. Still, investors should be a little wary of all the capital flowing into the sector—it can be a sign of a market top. That doesn’t necessarily mean a dip will come; recent gains could also be consolidated with the sector trading sideways for a while. Of course, another possibility is that shares keeps rising. It has certainly been tough to bet against EV stock in 2020. Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.com A big NIO bear is a little less bearish.

Health experts were alarmed by the news that the Trump administration will not work with an international efforts to develop and distribute a COVID-19 vaccine that is backed by the World Health Organization. Trump has repeatedly criticized the WHO for being pro-China and is pulling the U.S. out of the global agency. \"The United States will continue to engage our international partners to ensure we defeat this virus, but we will not be constrained by multilateral organizations influenced by the corrupt World Health Organization and China,\" said White House spokesman Judd Deere, as the Associated Press reported.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/natural-gas-futures-gain-nearly-50-in-august-but-rally-may-be-short-lived-2020-09-01?mod=home-page",
    "text": "Natural-gas futures rallied in August, tacking on nearly 50% to tally their largest monthly percentage gain in more than a decade as strong demand for the fuel in power generation significantly cut U.S. supplies in storage. In March, U.S. inventories of natural gas were 81% higher than the same a time year ago, but supplies recently stood at 20% above the year-ago level, according to Peter McNally, global sector lead for industrial materials and energy at investment research firm Third Bridge. The “need for backup power and peaking power demand” increased in the short term, amid blackouts in California, lifting usage of natural gas, he says. Prices saw a big increase at the beginning of August, buoyed by “strong demand from natural gas-fired power generation,” according to a monthly report from the Energy Information Administration released on Aug. 11. The EIA estimates that natural-gas consumption for power generation rose to 43.6 billion cubic feet per day in July 2020, “higher than any month on record.” Still, a decline in industrial natural-gas consumption, which fell by 1.4 billion cubic feet per day in July from a year earlier, likely due to slower economic activity, partially offset strength in consumption from electric power, the EIA said. Natural-gas production has fallen as producers have cut back on drilling and completion activities as a result of lower oil and natural-gas prices, according to the EIA, which estimates that output declined to 86.8 billion cubic feet per day in July, down 9.5 billion from the peak in November of 2019. That, combined with the rise in power generation demand, contributed to lower-than-average U.S. supply increases in July, it said. Even so, for the week ending Aug. 21, natural-gas inventories stood around 20% above the year-ago level. The market will be looking to natural-gas output that’s associated with oil production, says McNally. “Additional supplies of natural gas have emerged from the Permian Basin that produces natural gas associated with targeted oil production,” he says. “That associated gas supply has come off with oil production in recent months, but it is something we will be watching going ahead.” Meanwhile, Hurricane Laura, which made landfall in Louisiana in late August, also contributed to the climb in natural-gas prices, says Marshall Steeves, energy markets analyst IHS Markit, with the resulting production decline expected to be met with a similar fall in demand due to power losses. Prices for natural gas have climbed by nearly 80% from the year-to-date low in late June of around $1.48 Btus. However, the natural-gas supply surplus “remains formidable with the summer cooling season drawing to a close in September,” which is a transitional month, says Steeves. The natural-gas price rally may be “short-lived, absent another heat wave or supply disruption,” he says. It was another wild day for Kodak stock. Myra P.

    "text": "Zoom Video Communications Inc. topped a $100-billion market cap for the first time Tuesday, as continuing success amid the COVID-19 pandemic sent shares more than 40% higher in a single session. Analysts had high praise for the latest numbers, with JPMorgan’s Sterling Auty cheering the “truly impressive and in some ways unprecedented quarter” and FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi discussing Zoom’s “truly explosive growth.” Seyrafi called Zoom “the pre-eminent financial beneficiary of the COVID-19 crisis” and said he saw room for upside to fiscal third-quarter and full-year estimates. “For example, the company is guiding for revenue growth of ~3% quarter-over-quarter in the current FQ3 quarter, but we estimate that the average number of customers with more than 10 employees will grow by 18% Q/Q,” he wrote. “If we assume that revenue from customers with 10 or fewer employees grows by 5% Q/Q and if we model that the number of customers with more than 10 employees grows by 2% Q/Q, then in order to fit guidance, average revenue per user for customers with more than 10 employees will need to fall by 13% Q/Q.” That decline seems unlikely in his view, considering that Zoom’s average revenue per user for this base of customers hasn’t typically declined in the fiscal third quarter, in Seyrafi’s view. “Therefore, if prior ARPU trends persist, then there may be 15% of revenue upside relative to our model, which uses company guidance,” he concluded. Seyrafi has an outperform rating on the stock and he boosted his price target to $525 from $250. The July numbers left Bank of America’s Nikolay Beliov feeling upbeat about the long-term potential for Zoom’s business, even after the pandemic subsides. “The results confirm our view that Zoom is both a ‘vaccine’ and ‘vitamin’...as COVID-19 has permanently shifted the world to a hybrid-work environment and clearly elevated the awareness of cloud communications and videoconferencing,” he wrote. “This gives us confidence that these results are not just a pull forward of business, but are durable and sustainable trends.” Beliov has a buy rating on the stock and raised his price objective to $475 from $260. Needham’s Richard Valera argued that the company has an opportunity to double its revenue once again over the next three to four years. “While Zoom’s massive user growth has skewed its base toward the higher churn <10 user cohort, which will drive higher than historical churn, we see this as more than offset by the increased opportunity from both an enduring secular shift toward remote work, and a larger installed base to cross-sell Phone, Rooms and future products into,” he wrote, while reiterating a buy rating and upping his price target to $440 from $230. JPMorgan’s Auty said that other metrics beyond Zoom’s 355% revenue growth were notable as well. “It is the 41.7% operating margins and $373.4 million in quarterly free cash flow that stand out to us, especially when we consider the magnitude of the customers that are paying monthly and not annual in advance like some software companies rely on.” He maintained an overweight rating and boosted his price target to $425 from $220. At least 13 analysts hiked their targets after the report, according to FactSet. Of the 32 analysts tracked by the service who cover Zoom, 15 have buy ratings, 14 have hold ratings, and three have sell ratings. The average target now stands at $379.78. Shares of Tesla Inc. were knocked lower Tuesday, as the electric vehicle manufacturer took advantage of the stock’s best monthly performance in seven years to raise more capital.

    "text": "Any investor in the painful position of being caught on the short side of the Tesla juggernaut would certainly be forgiven for keeping a low profile, considering the stock’s incredible run. But Stanphyl Capital’s Mark Spiegel, in a recent letter to investors highlighted on the ValueWalk blog, reiterated the anti-Tesla thesis that he’s been spouting for years, while acknowledging the carnage that his short position has caused to his broader portfolio. “Year-to-date, Tesla (the biggest bubble in modern stock market history) is up an astounding 495%… and that hurt us significantly,” he wrote. “So our short positions have obliterated the profits from our long positions, and yet when this bubble pops we’ll be glad we have them.” From there, he touched on the bullet points as to why he believes he will ultimately profit from Tesla’s demise, including the lack of a moat and a return to red ink once emission credit sales expire.  He also tore into CEO Elon Musk, who he’s been consistently been painting as a fraud. “Superior competition” will also be a huge factor going forward, Spiegel explained,  with growing electric lineups from Audi, BMW, Mercedes, Volvo and Volkswagen, to name just a few. There is an old Wall Street saying that investing isn’t about being right or wrong, it’s about making money. No one understands that saying better than an investor in Tesla Inc.’s stock.

    "text": "The thought must’ve crossed many investors’ minds during the pandemic. Why not just get out of the markets entirely and switch into cash? Fund management giant Vanguard Group looked at the investors who did exactly that, in a study recently published. Now, the Vanguard crowd isn’t exactly that of Robinhood—between Feb. 19 and May 31, only 5% of self-directed defined-contribution plan participants traded at all. The proportion was somewhat higher among retail self-directed households, with 17% making some trades during that time period. For both sets of investors, less than 0.5% of clients moved into all-cash portfolio, Vanguard said. The defined contribution cash panickers went from having 69% of their $105,000 portfolios in stocks at the end of 2019, and the retail cash panickers went from having 77% of their $70,000 portfolios in stocks. In both cases, these investors were typically in the mid-50s and held accounts for over a decade. About two-thirds of the defined contribution cash panickers were female; the retail cash panicker split was 46% male, 29% female and 25% a household of two or more members. Vanguard then went and compared the distributions of their actual realized returns to their personal pre-pandemic benchmark returns. At the end of March, the cash panickers had done better, with 56% of defined contribution and 58% of individual investors sporting better returns. That changed as the market rebounded. By the end of May, 84% of the defined contribution cash panickers had worse returns than their pre-pandemic portfolio, with 86% of retail cash panickers doing worse. It has been a pretty bullish August for the stock market. That tends to work well in an incumbent U.S. President’s favor, but our call of the day says a twist could lie ahead.

    "text": "Bad news, folks. Just when you thought it was safe to take this job and, you know, a major scientific commission is warning that early retirement can cause Alzheimer’s—or at least serious cognitive decline. Sorry, FIRE fans. This gloomy news appears in an otherwise upbeat major new report on dementia research, conducted by a blue-ribbon global scientific panel, and published in the renowned British medical journal The Lancet. “[A] 12-year study of 1658 people found older retirement age but not number of years working was associated with lower dementia risk,” the Lancet Commission reports. “Another study found a twofold increase in episodic memory loss attributable to retirement…compared to non-retirees, adjusting for health, age, sex, and wealth.” Another cohort study of 3,433 people retiring at an average age of 61 found “verbal memory declined 38%. faster than before retirement.” Just for good measure, they added: “In countries with younger compared with higher retirement ages, average cognitive performance drops more.” Dementia is a much bigger issue than we typically acknowledge. It is destroying far more lives than COVID-19. There are an estimated 50 million people around the world with dementia, and that’s projected to triple over the next 30 years. There is no vaccine on the horizon. And the situation is getting worse. Most of those suffering from the disease are elderly. It is possibly the biggest single worry of those planning for retirement—not only because the disease is so bad but because it can last for years, taking a terrible toll on family, caregivers and family finances. The Lancet Commission consists of more than two dozen top medical scientists from around the world, from Britain to Israel to Australia. It has conducted a new systematic review of all the scientific research on Alzheimer’s and dementia published since its previous report in 2017. The bad news: Scientists still don’t know what causes Alzheimer’s, and are still struggling with medical treatments. The good news? Researchers have now found 12 different things which can drastically lower our risks. “These the 12 modifiable risk factors account for around 40% of world-wide dementias, which consequently could theoretically be prevented or delayed,” they report. Three of the 12 are newly identified, they say. The other nine, first identified in the 2017 report, have since been confirmed by further research, they add. Some of the 12 are things we can each control directly. Those who want to minimize their risks of getting dementia should avoid drinking too much alcohol, researchers say. They should avoid breathing in too much air pollution. They should stop smoking. As early as possible in life they should get their weight down to a healthy level, avoid obesity, take exercise, and lower their blood pressure. And when they start to lose their hearing, they should use a hearing aid. Apparently it really makes a difference. Oh, and finish high school: The more education you get before age 20, the less likely you are to end up with dementia. Other risk factors are more complex to control or avoid, such as avoiding traumatic brain injuries, depression and social isolation. (It’s courtesy of the Department of Irony and Unintended Consequences, by the way, that the COVID-19 lockdown is almost certainly causing spikes in most of these risk factors. People are more isolated, more depressed, they’re drinking more and eating more and exercising less.) Meanwhile, here’s a cheerful note. The Commission also reports that a big study of more than 15,000 people in China found that people over 65 who read, played games and gambled had reduced risk of getting dementia.

    "title": "When investors fear losing it all, skilled financial advisers bring them back to reality",
    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/when-investors-fear-losing-it-all-skilled-financial-advisers-bring-them-back-to-reality-2020-08-10?mod=home-page",
    "text": "With the U.S. economy grappling with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, investment advisers are seeing the ripple effects. Some clients fear losing everything they’ve built. For some, the threat of bankruptcy is a reality, while for others, even the remote possibility of going broke stirs feelings of dread. Advisers face a tricky challenge in aiding these anxious clients. On one hand, they have a responsibility to prepare individuals for the worst — and devise a plan if the money runs out. But in their effort to assist clients in desperate financial straits, they risk coming on too strong. Facing the likelihood of losing it all can prove immobilizing. Rushing to draft a detailed strategy and offer technical advice will backfire if a client isn’t ready to listen. First, an adviser needs to show concern and gather information. “Maybe the client is treading water with their anxiety,” said Meghaan Lurtz, a senior research associate at Kitces.com, which provides education and resources for financial planners. “Part of an adviser’s job is to be there while they tread” and serve as a sounding board. Advisers who set a supportive tone are better positioned to help clients grapple with their fear. Responding to anxiety with non-judgmental acceptance is a good first step. “It may be exhausting and stressful for advisers to deal with these clients,” Lurtz said. “But you still need to thank them for opening up to you. That makes them feel safe.” The next step is to try to learn more. To someone scared of losing their business, for example, say: “Tell me how things for you are going.” “Get to the heart of what the client is experiencing and what’s at the heart of their fear,” Lurtz said. “It may be they’re nervous about losing key employees to the virus or how long they can continue to pay them. Or it may be a decline in revenues and their P&L [profit and loss]. It may be about something else.” She urges advisers to make statements (“Tell me more about that”) rather than pose questions. That’s because clients are more apt to lower their guard and speak freely when responding to a neutrally worded prompt. “When we hear a question, our brain thinks there’s a right and wrong answer,” she said. “But people respond very differently to a statement. It cues the client that you really want to know, and solicits a richer type of response.” Advisers tend to draw conclusions from data analysis. If they think a client’s fear of losing it all is unfounded, they may trot out facts and figures as reassurance. Yet appealing to rationality when someone is not thinking clearly — and riddled with fear — carries risk. “Whether the fear is rational or irrational, it’s real in the client’s mind,” said Kim Bourne, a New York City-based certified financial planner. “So you have to get to the root cause, whatever is underlying that fear.” She cites the example of a client, a pre-retiree in his 60s, who feared a financial wipeout as the market tanked in mid-March. In reality, he held significant assets and faced no danger of bankruptcy. “He had the experience of poverty in his past, so he was afraid,” she said. “The fear of losing everything was lingering in his head.” Bourne dignified his fear. Instead of trying to appeal to his rational side by crunching the numbers, she sought to learn more about his feelings. “Tell me more about what it felt like when you didn’t have enough money,” she said. Then she asked, “What did you learn from those dark moments?” Then she asked: “How did that help you achieve your greatest financial accomplishments?” He came away with a restored sense of perspective, Bourne says, and his fear no longer plagues him as much. The president’s executive order deferred, but didn’t forgive, an employee’s Social Security tax liabilities. Morey Stettner is a writer in Portsmouth, N.H.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-to-build-an-investment-portfolio-that-supports-racial-justice-2020-06-29?mod=home-page",
    "text": "If you are an investor of any type — whether you have a 401(k), IRA, or trading account — there are a few things you could do to promote racial equity. You may have heard of ESG investing, which stands for “environmental, social and governance.” It is also often called sustainable, socially responsible or simply “values” investing. It’s an investment strategy that selects stocks and bonds based not only on traditional financial criteria, but also based on the impact of different companies on society and the environment. Proponents of ESG investing point to a growing body of evidence that suggests sustainable investing may actually improve a portfolio’s performance, while also serving the greater good. Over the past five years, sustainable funds have outperformed their conventional peers in both up and down markets, according to a Morningstar report. Also, as markets tumbled during the first quarter of 2020, almost 60% of the biggest U.S. sustainable mutual funds and exchange-traded funds lost less in market value than the S&P 500. The popularity of socially responsible investing has exploded in recent years. In early 2020, around 74% of global investors said they plan to increase their ESG allocation over the next year. In the first quarter of 2020, U.S., sustainable funds saw inflows of $10.5 billion, according to Morningstar — a more than 10-fold increase from the first quarter of 2010. And even as markets tumbled due to the coronavirus crisis, global demand for ESG proved resilient. The global sustainable-fund universe saw inflows of over $45 billion in the first quarter, while the overall fund universe saw outflows of more than $380 billion, according to Morningstar. Environmental factors often include things like carbon emissions and water usage. Social impact may involve working conditions for a company’s employees and gender or racial equity. And governance criteria often have to do with board oversight and transparency. In light of recent events, the “S” — or social — part of ESG has come into focus, as more and more people are looking at the social impact of large corporations, specifically from a racial justice standpoint. That’s where things get a little tricky. There are more than 300 funds marketed as ESG in the U.S., according to Morningstar. But there’s no official definition of “socially responsible” investing. To further complicate the issue, there are dozens of different companies that issue ESG ratings, ranging from large data providers, like MSCI and Sustainalytics, to smaller companies and even nonprofits that focus on topics like gender-pay equity and civil liberties. Unlike accounting standards, there is not one unique methodology. Some of the data is self-reported by the companies, and some of it is done by third parties, who are often estimating. There are of course some broad principles, like how the company treats its workers — but these are often hard to quantify. For example, companies can get a high score for having anti-harassment policies in place, without tracking how well the policies are actually implemented. “There are not yet clear apple-to-apple comparisons across the board even for public companies, let alone private companies,” said Andrei Cherny, CEO of Aspiration, an online “financial firm with a conscience,” which offers a variety of banking and investing products focused on environmental and social impact. Cherny has called for regulators to require public companies to report ESG-related data, such as carbon emissions, diversity of their workforce, and how they pay their employees — just like they have legal obligations to report their financial performance. “Those are factors that investors need to know just as much as they need to know the price-to-earnings ratio,” he said. Other industry leaders echo Cherny’s thoughts. For instance, in the wake of recent events, Calvert Research & Management, a prominent sustainable-investing shop, called for companies to “accurately assess their racial diversity” and make it public, provide pay equity disclosure across race and gender, and publicly state what they are doing to combat racism and police brutality. Meanwhile, some asset managers have decided to influence change from the inside. Neuberger Berman, which manages $330 billion, decided to use its shareholder status to drive governance and sustainability practices. In April 2020, the company announced that it would publicly disclose and explain the firm’s voting rationale and intentions at more than 25 key annual shareholder meetings. “Normally shareholders vote quietly behind the scenes,” said Jonathan Bailey, Head of ESG at Neuberger Berman. Instead, by providing advance vote disclosure, Neuberger Berman intends to educate investors and the public on “why we’re voting a particular way,” Bailey said. “We have a responsibility, as market participants, to take [these issues] seriously; they’re financially material issues,” Bailey said. The proposal did not end up passing, as it gathered about 30% shareholder support, according to a Neuberger Berman spokesperson. While there are currently no industry-wide standards around social impact, a few companies have launched niche products specifically targeted at race and equality. For example, OpenInvest, a company that builds indexes and other investing tools around social causes, has created an index specifically on racial justice. It screens for metrics like board member inclusion, workforce diversity and which companies pollute the most in communities of color. Similarly, Impact Shares, a nonprofit provider of exchange-traded funds, partnered with the NAACP to launch a first-of-its-kind racial empowerment ETF. But what the ESG industry has been missing is that “your social priorities may be drastically different from my social priorities,” said Ethan Powell, CEO of Impact Shares. For example, some ESG funds hold shares of liquor or gaming companies. These holdings might be a problem for some investors, but not others. Powell envisions a future where “effectively every social issue will be reflected with a separately investible fund,” so that investors can create portfolios that are reflective of their individual social priorities. Partnering with nonprofits could play a key role in the development of such products, according to Powell, because social-advocacy organizations are in a better position to understand the particular social issues at hand. What many experts agree on is that growing investor demand will inevitably push the industry to innovate. Years ago socially-responsible investing offered just a few options to cover a small piece of investors’ stock portfolios. Today, there are hundreds of different mutual and exchange-traded funds to pick from, not just in equities but also in fixed income and even junk bonds. One study showed that around $12 trillion of assets in the U.S. are managed under some sustainable investing strategy. So while you wait for the industry to establish widely-accepted standards, you could start building your own socially-responsible portfolio by looking at the ratings and methodology of different funds and companies and picking what aligns best with your values and financial goals.

    "text": "It’s been no secret that China was among the first to emerge from the pandemic that is still ravaging much of the world — in part because it was the first to experience the crisis, but also because of its heavy-handed but effective lockdown. And compared with much of the world, China’s current conditions are exceptional, and it has been seen as the sort of sentinel in how to return, and how to gauge that return, to elements of normalcy. Schools are mostly back in session, the coronavirus is under control save for a few small pockets, and a steady stream of solid economic news has come in lately. China is likely to be the only country globally to see full-year 2020 economic growth. That being said, China’s National Bureau of Statistics reported on Monday that the manufacturing index fell, while the services reading rose a bit. The country has come an enormous way since January, when it locked down. Yet these measurements of normalcy are misleadingly narrow — they define “normal” in terms of select economic areas, low coronavirus numbers, and kids returning to school — all important metrics. But as China exerts its newfound superpower status, it finds itself grappling with the most challenges faced in years if not decades. Defined this way, things are far from normal. “In these days of the global pandemic, ‘normal’ is relative,” Karen Eggleston, director of Stanford University’s Asia health-policy program, told MarketWatch on Wednesday. Eggleston added: “China still faces numerous challenges, from handling the risks of reinfection, to making up for the foregone/delayed screening and care for non-COVID conditions, to quickly but carefully developing and testing vaccines and preparing for national deployment in an industry previously rocked by scandal, to trying to address the structural challenges underlying [the difficulty and expense of receiving medical care], and addressing disparities in lifecourse opportunities for healthy lives that leads to a more than 10-year differences in life expectancy across regions.” Thus, under the placid surface of China’s post-coronavirus return to life largely as it was, lies a slew of exceptions, setbacks and maneuverings that are both part of its escape from the pathogen’s grip as well as its ongoing rise as the world’s up-and-coming global power. China’s true unemployment rate may never be known given China’s opaque system — the latest reading by outside experts puts the number at 20% among recent graduates — the concentration-camp scandal and virus crisis in the Xinjiang region are roiling potentially millions of lives, border clashes with India and historically bad relations with the U.S. (aggravated by the pandemic) put it at loggerheads with two giant rivals, Beijing’s takeover of Hong Kong has upended many lives there, and the worst floods in decades are wreaking havoc across a quarter of the country. Last weekend, China implemented restrictive export rules for technology companies, which could complicate an order from the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump’s that ByteDance sell the American operations of its subsidiary TikTok by Sept. 15. The move mirrors the economic retaliations the countries have been lobbing since the trade war. Most observers are focused on the brighter day-to-day return to normal life. “From afar it looks a miserable year for all the reasons you cited, but relatively China appears to be doing better than many other countries that are still struggling with the pandemic,” said China expert  Bill Bishop, author of the Sinocism newsletter and a former MarketWatch executive. Susan Shirk, currently a professor at the School of Global Policy and Strategy at the University of California, San Diego, who previously served as deputy assistant secretary of state responsible for U.S. policy toward China, agreed, telling MarketWatch, “I believe that what people mean when they contrast China’s ‘return to normalcy’ to the situation in the U.S. and many other countries, is simply that people have returned to in-person work, school, shopping, dining, and even travel now that the virus has been controlled for the time being.  But of course, you are right that there are many features of pre-covid life that haven’t returned yet and the government is on high alert for any new outbreaks.” COVID didn’t cause all of China geopolitical and trade issues, its frayed relationships with more than a handful of countries. But it certainly exacerbated them. We might do well to rethink our definition of “return to normalcy.” Tanner Brown covers China for  MarketWatch and Barron’s.

The sharp hit to the U.S. economy this year would end up laying the foundation for higher inflation numbers, according to Guy LeBas, chief fixed income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott, in an interview. JP Morgan economists estimated there is a 70% chance of personal consumption expenditures exceeding 2%,  excluding volatile food and energy prices. But LeBas suggested investors shouldn’t get too carried away. “Right now, we’re in the greatest dis-inflationary impulse we’ve seen in a decade,” he said. And many economists see this kind of so-called base effect as more of a statistical quirk rather than a long-term, structural increase in inflation that some have warned against. Market-based measures of inflation risks have returned back to pre-pandemic levels, in part due to the Federal Reserve’s announcement last week that it would aim for an average inflation rate of 2%. If markets are right, it will give the Fed the opportunity to show how the central bank’s new average inflation targeting regime works. Under the  policy, the Fed would not respond  to temporary overshoots of the inflation target with interest rate hikes to make up for periods when price pressures were muted. “If inflation does rebound, the Fed needs to put their money where their mouth is,” Tom Graff, head of fixed income at Brown Advisory, told MarketWatch. It was important that when inflation did return to 2%, the Fed needed to push back against any expectations for it to promptly raise interest rates in a public manner to convince the market it would adhere to its new policy approach. “Otherwise, this will all be for naught,” said Graff.

    "text": "Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard on Tuesday said the central bank should “pivot” to providing more support for U.S. economic growth in the months ahead after introducing a flurry of unprecedented programs earlier in the year when the coronavirus epidemic broke out. Brainard suggested a more aggressive approach would be needed to help Americans get back to work, reduce a high unemployment rate, and nudge inflation closer to the central bank’s goal. With interest rates already at record lows, presumably the Fed would accomplish that goal through the purchase of more assets such as U.S. Treasurys or privately held bonds. The Fed has already ramped up asset purchases to stabilize financial markets and pull down long-term interest rates. The lowest mortgage rates in modern times have spurred a rapid increase in homes sales even as the coronavirus continues to depress large swaths of the economy. Auto sales have also boomed. Yet Brainard also cautioned  that low interest rates stemming from the Fed’s looser inflation-fighting strategy could entice investors to take more risks in search of returns and destabilize asset prices once the economy expands again. The Fed would need to be vigilant, she said, and use all its tools to prevent asset volatility from derailing a recovery. In remarks to the Brookings Institution, Brainard became the latest Fed official to argue vociferously in favor of the central bank’s historic shift to inflation averaging. The Fed broke with decades of tradition last week to adopt an inflation-averaging strategy that could result in interest rates staying low for longer periods. The bank would strive for an average 2% inflation rate over an undetermined period of time instead of a hard 2% target before raising rates. Senior Fed officials, including Chairman Jerome Powell and Vice Chairman Richard Clarida, have come out in force in the past week to argue on behalf of the change. Brainard said the new strategy will help support an economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic and boost hiring in the long run, especially for less-skilled Americans on the fringes of the labor market. Echoing comments from her colleagues, Brainard said the Fed may have erred by raising interest rates as much as it did from 2015 to 2018. The central bank lifted its benchmark fed funds short-term rate to as high as 2.5% from the near-zero level that long prevailed in the aftermath of the 2007-09 Great Recession. The cost of many business and consumer loans are tied to the fed-funds rate. Although millions of Americans still found jobs, Brainard suggested hiring “would have been greater” had the Fed’s new inflation-averaging strategy been in place several years ago. Brainard said the Fed’s old approach to measuring inflation and deciding when to raise interest rates had become less effective because of major changes in the U.S. and global economies that have swept in an era of low inflation. The Fed used to raise interest rates when the unemployment rate fell, but the longstanding relationship, known to economists as the Phillips curve, began to break down more than a decade ago. Even as unemployment fell to record lows, inflation barely rose. For most of the past decade inflation has persistently run below the Fed’s 2% target, raising the specter of an even more damaging bout of deflation. The last time the U.S. experienced a serious bout of deflation was in the early stages of the Great Depression almost a century earlier. The new strategy, Brainard said, could “arrest any downward drift in inflation expectations.” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is getting heat over a solo hair salon visit in San Francisco at a time when California businesses are limited by concern over coronavirus.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/three-of-the-most-buzzworthy-moments-from-that-trump-laura-ingraham-interview-2020-09-01?mod=home-page",
    "text": "This interview was a talker. President Donald Trump sat down with Fox News host Laura Ingraham in the White House on Monday night, and the hour-long Q&A took some unexpected turns that went viral on social media overnight. The president compared police shooting unarmed Black suspects, such as a Kenosha, Wis. officer shooting Jacob Blake in the back seven times last week, to a golfer choking under pressure. Trump agreed that firing seven bullets into Blake in front of his children was extreme. “I mean, couldn’t you have done something different? Couldn’t you have wrestled him?” he asked. Yet he outraged many viewers by adding, “But they choke, just like in a golf tournament, they miss a 3-foot putt.” Ingraham cut him off, anticipating the blowback to the sound bite. “You’re not comparing it to golf, because that’s what the media would say,” she said. The president’s response? “No, I’m saying people choke, and people are bad people,” he said. “[Police officers] can do 10,000 great acts, which is what they do, and one bad apple — or a choker, you know, a choker, they choke — shooting the guy in the back many times.” The president alleged that people in the “dark shadows” are controlling his Democratic rival Joe Biden. Ingraham asked Trump, “Who is pulling Biden’s strings?” He responded with, “People that you’ve never heard of, people that are in the dark shadows” are controlling his presidential opponent. “There are people that are on the streets, there are people that are controlling the streets,” he continued, but wouldn’t elaborate, because he said the situation is under investigation. “We had somebody get on a plane from a certain city this weekend. And in the plane, it was almost completely loaded with thugs, wearing these dark uniforms, black uniforms, with gear and this and that,” he continued. “A lot of the people were on the plane to do big damage.” MSNBC political analyst Howard Fineman called these claims “truly nuts.” And CNN’s Daniel Dale said the “dark shadows” accusation was “almost too stupid fact-check.” Biden’s campaign responded in a statement posted to Twitter early Tuesday morning that read: “The President of the United States is bizarrely highlighting the unrest and division he has stoked, refusing to condemn violence committed by his own supporters. Donald Trump’s incomprehensible case for doing even more damage in a second term makes less and less sense every single day.” The president said the suburbs are in danger from Biden — and Black Democratic Sen. Cory Booker — expanding low-income housing. Ingraham also asked Trump how he plans to win over women voters who might view him as too aggressive, which led him to segue into explaining how he plans to make women feel safe again by pushing for law and order. That includes keeping the suburbs “safe” by blocking the expansion of low-income housing there. “They were trying to destroy the suburbs,” he said of the Democrats. “They want low-income housing, and with that comes a lot of other problems, including crime.” Ingraham cut him off once again, interjecting with, “You’re not saying poor people are criminals though.” The president responded, “No, I’m not saying that at all, but there is a level of violence that you don’t see.” He pointed to how he recently rescinded the Obama-era Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing (AFFH) rule, which housing advocates have said was necessary to fight racial segregation and discrimination in housing, but which Trump claimed has raised crime and hurt housing prices in those neighborhoods. Critics have called out the racist overtones of equating low-income housing with crime and neighborhood decline. And some accused Trump of racism again on Tuesday, especially after he called out Booker — a Black senator — for supporting the low-income housing expansion. Trump said Monday that Democrats are trying to build “low-income housing projects right in the middle of your neighborhood,” and argued that if Biden gets elected president, “it’s gonna go at a much higher rate than ever before, and you know who’s gonna be in charge of it? Cory Booker.” Trump also called the Black Lives Matter movement a “Marxist organization,” and once again claimed to have done more for America’s Black community than any president in history, “except for maybe Abraham Lincoln.” Catch the full interview here.

    "title": "As schools reopen amid COVID-19 pandemic, how long do asymptomatic children remain contagious?",
    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/as-schools-reopen-amid-covid-19-pandemic-how-long-do-asymptomatic-children-remain-contagious-11599043219?mod=home-page",
    "text": "A new study published in JAMA Pediatrics suggests that children can shed SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, even if they never develop symptoms or even for long after symptoms have cleared. It found a significant variation in how long children continued to shed virus through their respiratory tract and, therefore, could potentially remain infectious. While the virus was detectable for an average of about 2.5 weeks in the entire group, a significant portion of the children —about a fifth of the asymptomatic patients and about half of the symptomatic ones — were still shedding virus at three weeks. The researchers also found that the duration of COVID-19 symptoms also varied widely, from three days to nearly three weeks. A recent systematic review estimated that 16% of children with SARS-CoV-2 infection are asymptomatic, but evidence suggests that as many as 45% of pediatric infections are asymptomatic, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The signs and symptoms of COVID-19 in children are similar to other infections and noninfectious processes, including influenza. While children infected with SARS-CoV-2 are less likely than adults to develop severe illness or complications, they are still at risk of becoming ill. “Recent COVID-19 hospitalization surveillance data shows that the rate of hospitalization among children is low (8 per 100,000 population) compared with that in adults (164.5 per 100,000 population),” the CDC said. Such research comes at an important time for families and communities. Amid pressure from the teachers union to delay the start of the school year, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Tuesday that in-person classes will be pushed back until Sept. 21, 11 days later than planned. Remote learning, also originally slated to start on Sept. 10, will now commence on Sept. 16. Other countries have not fared so well with school reopenings. Israel, which also reopened schools this week, had less success when it reopened schools on May 17 amid high temperatures that made it difficult for students to wear masks, full classrooms that made social distancing near-impossible and, perhaps, the illusion that the virus had been vanquished, creating a false sense of security. The risk, as Israel discovered, is providing an environment where children unwittingly spread the virus to each other, which can lead to community transmission. That’s particularly worrying for those who have underlying conditions and the elderly who are more vulnerable to the most severe effects of the virus. Community transmission also makes contact tracing more difficult. A school outbreak can lead to community, hence staggered school reopenings, social distancing and reduced class sizes. “If we find a certain number of symptomatic people testing positive, we expect the same number of asymptomatic carriers that are much more difficult to identify and isolate,” said Enrico Lavezzo, a professor in the University of Padua’s department of molecular medicine. The latest study in the peer-reviewed JAMA Pediatrics focused on 91 pediatric patients at 22 hospitals in South Korea. “Unlike in the American health system, those who test positive for COVID-19 in South Korea stay at the hospital until they clear their infections even if they aren’t symptomatic,” said Roberta DeBiasi, chief of the Division of Infectious Disease at the Children’s Hospital in Washington, D.C. The patients here were identified for testing through contact tracing or developing symptoms. About 22% never developed symptoms, 20% were initially asymptomatic but developed symptoms later, and 58% were symptomatic at their initial test. The hospital staff tested them every three days on average, providing a picture of how long viral shedding continues over many weeks. Among the important findings from the study: Children, a group widely thought to develop mostly mild disease that quickly passes, can shed virus for weeks, DeBiasi and Meghan Delaney, chief of the Division of Pathology and Lab Medicine at the Children’s National Hospital in Washington, D.C., wrote in a commentary piece to accompany the study in JAMA Pediatrics. Other key points: Even asymptomatic children continued to shed coronavirus after testing positive, making them potential key vectors. In this study at least, there were a large number of asymptomatic patients: About one-fifth of the group in South Korean hospitals. They said the study provides important insight on the role children might play in the spread of COVID-19. But the study also has obvious limitations. One of these relates the link between testing and transmission. A “positive” or “negative” result may not necessarily mean that a child is infectious, “with some positives reflecting bits of genetic material that may not be able to make someone sick,” or, on the other hand, “negatives reflecting low levels of virus that may still be infectious.” They may have tested different parts of the respiratory tract and different testers may yield different results. It’s unclear whether symptomatic children shed different quantities of virus than symptomatic patients. They tested for the active virus – not antibodies – excluding those who may have had and cleared an asymptomatic or mild infection, an important factor for understanding herd immunity. However, DeBiasi said studies such as these can add to the knowledge of public-health efforts being developed and refined to bring COVID-19 under control. “Each of these pieces of information that we, our collaborators and other scientists around the world are working to gather is critical for developing policies that will slow the rate of viral transmission in our community,” she said. As of late Wednesday, COVID-19 has infected 25,773,958 people worldwide, which mostly does not account for asymptomatic cases, and killed 857,552. The U.S. still has the world’s highest number of COVID-19 cases (6,075,652), followed by Brazil (950,931), India (3,769,523) and Russia (1,001,965), according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University. In the meantime, cases keep rising in the U.S. with California becoming the first state in the country to surpass 700,000 confirmed cases; infections there hit 715,617 as of Tuesday with 13,150 COVID-related deaths. New York has recorded 435,510 infections and the highest number of deaths in the U.S. (32,966). COVID has killed 184,689 people in the U.S. AstraZeneca AZN, -1.10% , in combination with Oxford University; BioNTech SE BNTX, -5.61% and partner Pfizer PFE, -2.40% ; GlaxoSmithKline GSK, -1.61% ; Johnson & Johnson JNJ, -1.23% ; Merck & Co. MERK, -0.31% ; Moderna MRNA, -2.41% ; and Sanofi SAN, -1.34% are among those currently working toward COVID-19 vaccines. The Dow Jones Industrial Index DJIA, +0.75%, the S&P 500 SPX, +0.75% and the Nasdaq Composite COMP, +1.39% all ended higher Tuesday. Over the past five months, the Dow’s advanced 30%, its biggest 5-month percent gain since July 2009, while the S&P 500 added over 35%, its best 5-month run since October 1938.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/an-experts-guide-to-road-tripping-with-your-dog-2020-09-02?mod=home-page",
    "text": "Even in the heart of a COVID-19 pandemic…make that especially in the heart of a COVID-19 pandemic, the summer road trip is a traditional taste of freedom that’s been celebrated since the automobile was invented. Inviting your dog to join you on these highway adventures makes you a much better person (just ask your pup). Keep in mind, however, that it’s going to take a little bit of planning. Nothing major, just some smart forethought and consideration for your 4-legged traveling companion. If you’re reading this story on your phone as your road-trip vehicle idles in the driveway, your dog in the seat next to you and you’re waiting for the Sherpas to finish packing the car, stop. You’ll still have a great road trip, but you should have started thinking through this journey with the dog a few weeks earlier. That’s when you would have gathered your pooch’s essential traveling tools like vaccination records, medicines, and a current dog tag with your mobile number on it. Of course, your dog has an ID microchip implanted because you love him/her, right? OK, be sure that the chip number is loaded into your smartphone. A pre-trip trip to the vet isn’t a bad idea either just to make sure everything is in order. And vet runs are always good practice for how well a dog travels. Another important pre-road trip consideration is which vehicle to take. If you’re a one-car family, of course, that’s academic. But if you have a choice, choose the SUV that has AC vents in back (your dog will worship you if you can get cooling air to the rear seats where most road trip dogs travel). Summer heat is unforgiving, especially to canines. Although SUVs work best for road trips with dogs — lots of extra gear comes along — cars will work just fine, too, and you won’t get any complaints out of Muttley either way. The important thing is to try to keep the second row — aka, the back seat — clear of luggage and gear so that your dog can take ownership of the space and feel secure in it. Leather seating cleans easier, but if you’re a big-dog owner, make sure you protect the rear seat from scratching nails with a pet hammock seat cover designed to keep your dog safe and protect the seat from natural pet behavior. It’ll also make cleaning up after the trip — dogs are dogs and they never learn to clean up their rooms, after all — infinitely easier. Other essentials to prep before you go are a no-spill water dish, treats (of course), toys (of course, of course), and a few items from home that carry your scent to comfort him, like a favorite blanket or even your pup’s bed. Don’t forget to pack food (pack about 15%t extra for travel) and food bowls. If you plan on camping or hiking, a first aid kit designed specifically for dogs is a good addition to your list. All you have to do now is get your dog’s Instagram account set up and you’re ready to travel. 1. I’m thirsty. 2. I have to pee. These sweetly ironic rules should come as no surprise. Water helps dogs function, flush toxins, regulate body temperature, and keep noses wet for optimal sniffin’. And it keeps them peeing throughout the day. When you’re on the road with a canine companion, always keep those two facts in mind as priorities. Pee stops are a good chance to get a little exercise, too, for both the dog and the driver. Speaking of exercise, no matter where you are on the journey, don’t hesitate to ask your smartphone for the location of the nearest dog park (every city and town has at least one) or if you’re doing a coastal trip, a dog beach. Both of these places are great shared communities where the natural practice is to stay at least 6 feet apart without seeming unfriendly. That’s true all across America, from the Union Square Dog Run in Manhattan to the Cayucos Dog Beach along California’s Highway 1. Plus, a worked out, sleeping dog travels best. Camping with dogs is a special kind of blast. These days, however, motels (and many hotels) seem to be getting more dog-friendly than ever. It’s easy to find a place where your tail-wagger can bunk with you free or for a very small fee. Many restaurants, too, especially now that coronavirus has forced so many dining establishments to expand their outdoor seating, are happy to accommodate with a big smile, a full menu and a fresh bowl of water for Fido. A road trip seen through eyes of a dog keeps car travel fresh. It may not always be super simple, but it is always rewarding and guaranteed to bring you and your companions, human and nonhuman, closer together. Treat every meal, motel stay and pee stop as a teaching and learning moment — a chance to refine your pup’s already stellar behavior. So relax and go have fun. If you and your dog have found a rhythm together at home, you’ll absolutely find one on the road. This story originally ran on Autotrader.com.

    "title": "Moving? What you should know about doing it in a pandemic",
    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-to-move-in-a-pandemic-2020-09-02?mod=home-page",
    "text": "This article is reprinted by permission from NerdWallet. Moving is stressful enough without throwing a pandemic into the mix. Many Americans may be forced to consider moving as some federal foreclosure and eviction moratoriums have expired. In the first week of July, 32% of Americans did not make a full, on-time housing payment, according to a nationally representative survey by the website Apartment List. Others may relocate to save money, be closer to loved ones or simply leave a densely populated area. If you’re considering moving, here’s what to know from a financial standpoint, as well as tips to make moving day safer. Aside from the usual expenses like buying boxes, renting a van or hiring movers, plan for extra costs because of the pandemic. You may need to buy heavy-duty supplies to deep-clean your old place, for example, or to sanitize your new accommodations. If you are moving out of a rental unit, some landlords may ask you to pay for professional cleaners or take the cost out of your security deposit. The Big Move: I work in Silicon Valley, but my job is now remote. I can finally live somewhere cheaper. Where should I go? Moving across county or state lines? Check what the quarantine requirements are in your new location, says Jean Wilczynski, a certified financial planner and senior wealth adviser at Exencial Wealth Advisors in Old Lyme, Connecticut. You may have to pay for quarantine accommodations like a hotel or Airbnb if your new apartment or home is not move-in ready, she says. If you are receiving unemployment benefits, check the rules on how your benefits carry forward in your new location and what the taxes are if it is a new state, Wilczynski says. You can typically find this information on your state’s Department of Labor website, she says. If you are unemployed or your income has dropped as a result of the pandemic, you can also check whether you qualify for moving assistance by calling 211. You might not be able to really get to know your new place until you’re living there, so prepare yourself (and your wallet) for surprises like leaky faucets or broken appliances. Landlords and real-estate agents may offer only virtual tours. And if you can see the new accommodations in person, you may be required to sign a waiver, wear a mask and avoid touching anything while in the house. How to move safely depends on whether you are doing it yourself or using movers. Current guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that the main way the coronavirus spreads is through respiratory droplets, says Lindsay Slowiczek, pharmacist and drug content integrity manager at Healthline.com. That’s why wearing a mask and staying away from people is important to slow the spread of the virus, she says. Sanitizing surfaces is also an extra precaution worth taking. If you’re renting a moving truck, companies like U-Haul offer contactless pickup and drop-off options. Slowiczek suggests sanitizing the door handles, steering wheel, radio and the metal tongue on the seat belt in the rental van. Before picking a moving company, check its website or call and ask about its safety practices in response to the pandemic, Slowiczek says. Ask whether the movers wear masks and gloves during the move. On moving day, she suggests being prepared with a plan to limit interaction with movers and maintain social distancing. This includes packing as many things as you can yourself, or consider using a self-pack moving container as Slowiczek did for her own recent move. The Big Move: I’m tired of renting in Manhattan, but love living in New York. Is now the time to buy if the city is supposedly dead? If the movers will pack the truck, create a schedule for the movers. For example, ask them to start with a particular room as you stay in another. This is also particularly useful if you live with family members who are vulnerable or immunocompromised, she says. Try to limit their involvement with the move as much as possible. “Plan out the way [the movers] are going to move through the house,” says Slowiczek. “If possible, move all of [your boxes] to one area in your home so they don’t have to come throughout your house as much.” Keep hand sanitizer or soap handy during the move so that you and the movers can use it periodically, she says. (Check on the FDA website that your brand of hand sanitizer is methanol-free, Slowiczek adds). After the move, use disinfectants registered with the Environmental Protection Agency to clean surfaces or furniture. “Just using the product as-is is not enough — read the instructions on how long it should be wet on the surface,” Slowiczek says.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is using its authority to implement a temporary eviction moratorium through the end of the year, the Trump administration said Tuesday evening. Unlike the federal moratorium included in the CARES Act that expired in late July, the CDC's moratorium will apply to all rental units nationwide, senior administration officials said. Renters will be eligible for the moratorium's protection if they received a stimulus check, and they must be able to prove that they made an effort to receive government assistance and that they could not afford rent.

    "text": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention implemented a temporary eviction moratorium through the end of the year, protecting U.S. renters from losing their homes during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Trump administration announced Tuesday. The CDC’s moratorium will apply to all rental units nationwide until Dec. 31 and goes into effect immediately, senior administration officials said of an unpublished CDC agency order. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told a U.S. House of Representatives panel Tuesday that the moratorium would cover around 40 million renters. Renters will be eligible for the moratorium’s protection if they received an economic impact payment, or stimulus check, as provided for by the CARES Act. Therefore, single renters must earn no more than $99,000 a year, while couples filing jointly can earn up to $198,000 annually. The order, which was shared ahead of being published in the Federal Register on Sept. 4, includes a declaration for renters to sign and give their landlord. Senior Trump administration officials said the form would be made available on the CDC’s website. Renters must indicate on the declaration that they cannot afford to pay their rent in full and that if evicted they would become homeless or force to move into congregate housing. Renters also must be able to prove that they made an effort to receive government assistance and that they could not afford rent. The moratorium does not absolve renters of paying the rent. That money is still due to landlords, and senior administration officials said that renters should still attempt to make partial payments when they cannot afford to pay in full. Landlords will still be permitted to evict tenants in certain cases, such as instances in which the tenant has destroyed property or poses a threat to the health or safety of neighbors. The moratorium builds on a previous executive order from President Donald Trump that directed the Department of Health and Human Services and the CDC to determine whether halting evictions was necessary to contain the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19. “In the context of a pandemic, eviction moratoria — like quarantine, isolation, and social distancing — can be an effective public health measure utilized to prevent the spread of communicable disease,” the CDC’s unpublished order said. “President Trump is committed to helping hardworking Americans stay in their homes and combating the spread of the coronavirus,” White House deputy press secretary Brian Morgenstern said during a briefing Tuesday. Housing advocates said the move was “long overdue,” but called for more help to be provided to renters facing financial difficulties amid historically high levels of unemployment caused by the pandemic. “As we have said for five months, the very least the federal government ought to do is assure each of us that we won’t lose our homes in the middle of a global pandemic: The administration’s action would do so and will provide relief from the growing threat of eviction for millions of anxious families,” said Diane Yentel, president and CEO of the National Low Income Housing Coalition. “But while an eviction moratorium is an essential step, it is a half-measure that extends a financial cliff for renters to fall off of when the moratorium expires and back rent is owed,” Yentel added, while calling on Congress to pass another COVID-19 relief bill with at least $100 billion in emergency rental assistance. Previously, some lawmakers and activists called for a cancellation of rent during the pandemic. Trump administration officials during Tuesday’s briefing said that renters and landlords would have access to emergency funds already in place, including billions of dollars in grants from the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the $142 billion coronavirus relief fund from the Treasury Department. Administration officials could not clarify whether the CDC moratorium would prevent eviction filings from occurring. Housing and legal advocates have raised concerns that landlords filed evictions against many people nationwide who should have been protected by the CARES Act moratorium. An executive order by President Donald Trump called for distributing an additional $300 in weekly unemployment benefits from a $44 billion fund set aside for disaster relief.

    "text": "One way U.S. voters are being played during this presidential election campaign is the deceitful manner in which key issues are being framed for their consumption. Arguably the biggest and most important of these concerns the so-called “third rail” of American politics: Social Security. President Donald Trump has vowed to kill funding for this critical, gargantuan program that nearly 70 million Americans depend on. What? You haven’t heard Trump say he wants to kill Social Security’s funding? Actually, you have. Trump says he wants to kill the payroll tax — which is how Social Security is funded. Perhaps like many Americans, you’re unaware of how Social Security is financed. It comes from payroll taxes that are paid by you and your employer. The past four years have convinced me that there are many other things that Trump’s supporters don’t seem to understand either (trade/tariffs, regulations, the stock market, etc.) but I digress. “If victorious on November 3rd,” the president said on Aug. 8th, “I plan to forgive these taxes and make permanent cuts to the payroll tax.” He then added: “I’m going to make them all permanent.” So when Trump talks of a “payroll tax cut,” you might think that sounds great. A tax cut! But this is deceptive election year politics, designed to take advantage of voter ignorance. Anyone in the media that’s going along with Trump’s framing of this as a mere tax cut is also being played. Trump seems to think that killing the payroll tax will save companies big bucks (His 2017 corporate tax cut wasn't enough?) while increasing the take home pay of American workers. Bigger take home pay? Tens of millions of Americans don’t have pay — period — thanks to the economic collapse brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. Important sidebar: Note that Trump said in late February, when the U.S. had just 15 coronavirus cases, that we would soon be down to none — proof, he said, that he was an effective leader. “When you have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that’s a pretty good job we’ve done,” Trump said at the time. Yet as of this writing, the U.S., with about 4% of the world’s population, has more than six million cases — one of every four on the planet. Not that this and other gross miscalculations and bumbling has stopped Trump from believing — and actually looking into — how he could be added to Mount Rushmore, alongside Presidents Lincoln, Washington, Jefferson and Theodore Roosevelt. It doesn’t get more delusional than this except, perhaps, for kooky Trump advisers like economist Stephen Moore, and even Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who has said that Social Security could always be paid for by moving trillions of dollars from the government’s “general fund to those trusts funds.” Trillions of dollars from the general fund?  What trillions of dollars? The federal deficit for fiscal year 2019 that ended last Sept. 30 was $984 billion. It has nearly quadrupled this year to a staggering $3.7 trillion, and this will skyrocket even further if another round of pandemic aid gets passed. These sums — so vast as to be nearly incomprehensible — get added on to the national debt, which as of last week was $26.6 trillion, up 33.6% on Trump’s watch. Remember: Trump said he would eliminate the entire national debt — not the deficit, the national debt itself — in eight years, because of all the brilliant trade deals he would do. Here we are four years later and things are worse, far worse, than ever. Other White House advisers, seeing the political damage this kind of talk has inflicted in a tough election race, have walked back plans to kill Social Security’s funding. And yet Trump’s words speak for themselves. All this loose talk is an insult to the tens of millions of Americans who are heavily dependent on Social Security (and Medicare too). “Heavily dependent” is not hyperbole. Consider some numbers: According to the Social Security Administration, the average monthly benefit for recipients this year is $1,503. As modest as this is, it represents just about everything — “90% or more” of all income received by “21% of married couples and about 45% of unmarried persons. It’s probably difficult for wealthy men like Trump, Mnuchin (who moonlights as the chief trustee of the Social Security Trust Fund) and others to see, but there is a vast sea of poverty in the United States. Click here to read a recent MarketWatch column I wrote about seniors and poverty. I’m talking about men and women — tens of millions of American workers — who paid into the system over their entire working lives. They deserve more respect than the Trump administration is showing them — and the assurance that the U.S. government will, without fail, honor the obligations it has made to them. Since Trump’s base skews older, it’s reasonable to assume that many of them, too, are overly dependent on Social Security. They, and everyone else, must understand that when the president talks about a payroll tax cut, it doesn’t mean what it seems. Have a question about retirement, including where to retire?

    "title": "The tension behind ‘OK boomer’—why millennials are so resentful of the ‘Me Generation’",
    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-tension-behind-ok-boomerwhy-millennials-are-so-resentful-of-the-me-generation-2020-09-02?mod=home-page",
    "text": "This article is reprinted by permission from NextAvenue.org. In her provocative new book, “OK Boomer, Let’s Talk: How My Generation Got Left Behind,” millennial author and journalist Jill Filipovic argues that baby boomers are largely to blame for the financial, employment and health woes of millennials. So, as a boomer and editor of Next Avenue’s Money & Policy and Work & Purpose channels, I wanted to take Filipovic up on her offer and talk. We did. During my interview with the 37-year-old CNN columnist and New York Times contributing opinion writer, and after reading her book, I discovered that Filipovic’s condemnation of boomers was more nuanced than her title suggests. It turns out that Filipovic credits boomers (now age 56 to 74) for a few things and takes millennials (now age 24 to 40) to task a bit, too. Also, I learned, some of her vitriol against boomers is really directed at conservative boomer commentators on Fox News and talk radio. Still, she makes some serious allegations against boomers and challenges them to change their ways. To research her book, Filipovic sent out an online survey to a few hundred millennials, boomers, Gen Xers, Silent Generation and Gen Z members. Then, she held in-depth conversations with a few dozen of them; some of those people ended up in the book. Jill Filipovic: I’ve been thinking about a lot of the issues that I cover in the book for a while. And when that OK Boomer meme hit, I ended up writing a column about it for CNN that seemed to really touch a nerve. So I was interested in writing a book, not to look at the meme itself, but explore the tension behind it. Why millennials and younger folks in general were so resentful of baby boomers and then why baby boomers reacted with such a profound offense at being told ‘OK Boomer.’ The goal was to go beyond the tension and try to have a conversation. You call the book a reckoning, but also a peace offering to boomers. What do you mean? I didn’t want to write a book that was just an indictment of baby boomers, although it certainly is an indictment of many of the decisions they made as they came into adulthood and took political control of the country. So, I wanted it to be  reckoning first of how we got here. It wasn’t just an accident. There were political decisions made before boomers were born and when they were young that opened up a certain set of opportunities for them. And then, as baby boomers came into adulthood, there were choices made by politicians that many baby boomers voted for and eventually by baby boomers themselves that foreclosed upon some opportunities for millennials. I wanted to dig in very honestly to that history and essentially ask the boomer audience to look at that in its face and confront it. The peace offering comes from if we understand what happened, then we can move forward. And so it is asking baby boomers, OK, let’s get past some of the silly generational warfare — the ‘OK Boomer’/ ‘Millennial Snowflake’ business — and get to work on repairing some of the damage that has been done. You write that both boomers and millennials have been unfairly maligned. We’ll talk about millennials in a minute, but how do you think boomers have been maligned? Well, I think the stereotype about boomers is that they’re all these kind of reactionary, right-wing conservatives. (Laughs.) I think that is certainly not true. Boomers are the most politically polarized generation in America, cleaved pretty neatly down the middle, between left and right. While there have been conservative boomers who have had a disproportionate share of political power, the reality is there are also boomers who have been sounding the alarm on the exact same issues that millennials are now up in arms about. Boomers were not the founders of the civil-rights movement, the feminist movement or the antiwar movement but they certainly were many of those movements’ foot soldiers. And they continue to be many of the most notable, interesting, current advocates of things like feminism and racial justice. So, there are a lot of boomers who are doing incredible, important work who have spent their lives trying to improve things. They have not captured as much political power as the conservative Donald Trump baby boomers in the world. That doesn’t mean that they don’t exist. And I think that when we paint a generation with a broad brush, we miss the fact that baby boomer women entered the workforce in record numbers, which very much did open up a series of opportunities that women of my generation are getting to enjoy. Not everything that is wrong in America is the fault of the baby boomers and much of the progress that we’ve seen in the last half-century is thanks to baby boomers. The progressive half of the boomer generation deserves quite a lot of credit. But you also say boomers are largely responsible for the political and cultural backlash to the civil rights, feminists and LGBTQ rights movements. Aren’t you really talking about conservative commentators and politicians? That’s right….You see conservative commentators on Fox News claiming the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr. and people like John Lewis. That’s just not true. You say that millennials are ‘widely chastised but poorly understood.’ Why do you think boomers chastise millennials so much? Part of it is just the cyclical nature of generations and old versus young. (Laughs.) Boomers were certainly chastised when they were young as well and cast as The Me Generation and being sort of selfish narcissists. I think what’s different now is there is a boomer-targeted conservative media that really uses millennials as a scapegoat group and makes an example of us as sort of short hand for everything that’s wrong with America and all of the ways the young and the left, which they think are intertwined, are kind of trying to reshape the country into something unrecognizable. I think the biggest misunderstanding is that a lot of boomers assume millennials came into adulthood facing a similar set of opportunities that boomers did. And that if we have failed to achieve the milestones of adulthood that boomers achieved, that that must an individual failing rather than society and an economy that looks completely different and does not have nearly as many open doors as boomers were able to walk through. You also think boomers have it wrong about millennials and work. Some boomers think millennials hop around from job to job too quickly. What do you say? There’s actually no evidence that millennials job hop more than boomers did. Young people job hop, right? And boomers did when they were young as well. I think what boomers are missing is that many boomers did have a ladder up to the middle class. Whereas I think many millennials feel we don’t. We had to scramble and climb and really fight for scraps. We did not enter an economy where your employer is going to look out for you. Mention the word ‘pension’ to a millennial and they’re going to laugh in your face. It’s just a completely foreign concept to us. Many of us don’t even have retirement accounts; many of us aren’t even eligible to participate in employee retirement accounts. Many of us don’t even have health insurance. So, I think we really are doing our best to scramble and scrounge and hustle. Boomers perceive it as disloyal and trying to rise too far, too fast and entitled. And I think millennials just see it as trying to survive. In one big theme of your book, you say millennials are suffering from a kind of ‘generation-wide cognitive dissonance’ — a profound gap between the expectations they were raised to hold and the reality they experience. Can you talk about that? Definitely. Many millennials were raised with this promise that if we worked hard and did well in school, got a college education, that we would be on the path to a relatively stable life. That there would be a relationship between effort and outcome. And I think a lot of us are realizing that has turned out to not necessarily be true. A lot of us didn’t have the basic markers of adulthood that our parents were able to accrue; we couldn’t afford a house, we can barely afford the rent, we’re living with roommates at 30. I think a lot of us internalized those failures as individuals and think that we must have done something wrong. And I think what you’re seeing now is that a lot of millennials are having a collective awakening almost, and realizing: ‘Hey, wait a minute! This is a theme across our generation. It can’t possibly mean that all of us are screw ups. Something else is going on here.’ I thought it was fascinating that you say boomers tend to love their millennial kids and vice versa. But you say the generations have problems with each other as a whole. Why do you think there’s this disparity between the micro and the macro? A lot of baby boomers as parents did quite a bit for their kids…They looked at their relationships with their parents and said I don’t want to have a very authoritarian I’m-the-parent-you’re-the-kid kind of relationship. I want to do it better. All of which are good things. I, like so many millennials, benefited from my parents’ extending resources, helping me with my homework, buckling me into my car seat. Related: Millennials and younger Americans now constitute a majority of the U.S. population And the parents understand their children’s individual struggles. They don’t think their kid is lazy even if the kid is 32 and living at home or if you’re still paying your son’s cellphone bill. I think where millennials become frustrated is them looking around and seeing how much it mattered who your parents were and what their resources were and how that set the trajectory of your life. My life is pretty good and I feel lucky and grateful for that. I’m aware at how profoundly unfair that is. And if I had been born into different circumstances, I could’ve wound up in a really different place. That’s a fair question. From the millennials’ side, yes there’s a sense of gratitude for the individual investments our parents made, but the ire comes from the political choices some parents made. I would say it’s a long list… (Laughs.) One source of frustration is that baby boomers had a chance to both continue and expand the government programs that really did open so many doors to them and prop up the ladder to the middle class. But instead what happened is that boomers shut those doors and pulled the ladder up. When boomers were coming of age, there was significant investment in the future, in infrastructure, in building schools and roads and paying for higher education. As boomers have aged, that reversed. And now that agenda has been consolidated into entitlement programs for aging. See: There’s only one generation in U.S. history that’s considered to be more unlucky than the ‘Lost Generation’ I don’t think millennials resent that we’re paying for baby boomers and older folks to have Social Security and Medicare. We support those programs. We just resent that the largess is essentially being largely taken from our future and that we are not being invested in similarly. You write that ‘boomers, unfortunately, don’t seem interested in sharing.’ What could boomers do to be sharing better? I think first and foremost boomers need to be sharing power… 2018 was a record year for millennials in Congress because they went from 1% to 6%. We’re 22% of the population! We would love to see political parties really investing in getting young people elected, not just to work on campaigns. Really giving us power. Being willing to step aside. Being willing to share that power. And not just in politics. But also in business and advocacy and nonprofits and newsrooms. All of the layers of work, society and civic alignment. Some of the problems you say millennials face are ones I think boomers also face. You say: “millennials struggle to get decent health care.” Isn’t that also true for boomers who aren’t yet eligible for Medicare, if you’re talking about health insurance premiums? These things are not unique to millennials, but I would say they’re pronounced for millennials. And you say ‘it’s millennials who shoulder the demands of the new always-on lifestyle and feel all the exhaustion, anxiety and burnout that comes with it.’ I’m a boomer and many of my friends are and we feel this, too. Millennials have experienced this their entire working lives. You write that millennials “look forward to empty federal coffers when we retire.” I know the Social Security trust fund is due to run short of money in 2035, but don’t you think between now and then, Congress and whomever the president is will come up with ways to shore it up like they did in the 1980s, the last time we were in this position? Of course, there is still time to fix that impending problem and I’d hope that’s the case. But millennials are cynical generally that they’ll be taken care of because we haven’t been taken care of so far. You say that when it comes to the transformative power of technology and the internet, millennials ‘screwed this one up.’ Why do you say that? You wrote most of the book before the pandemic. How do you think the pandemic has changed the way millennials look at boomers and the way boomers look at millennials? I hope it is changing some of the perceptions. I think the pandemic has made many of us feel a level of insecurity and hyperconnectiveness that for millennials has been normal for quite a long time. I would hope that engenders some sense of solidarity. Millennials lost more jobs in the pandemic than any generation. So, we are in big trouble. But boomers have lost jobs too and it’s very hard to get hired if you’re unemployed and over 50, due to age discrimination. Definitely. I don’t mean to sound callous about the challenges that boomers face. Age discrimination is real. But it’s important not to write off or negate the hardship that millennials are facing in this moment. Your book is about boomers and millennials. What’s your view about Gen X, the generation in between boomers and millennials? You write that you hope well-meaning boomers will be inspired to do something before it’s too late. What would you like them to do? I’d love to see boomers investing in the issues millennials care about most and listening to what millennials and Gen Zers are talking about. It matters for our futures. I think we would do well to recognize the tremendous amount of experience and wisdom so many boomers bring to the table and that, to some degree, a lot of boomers have been fighting these fights a long time. We can work intergenerationally to make something better for all of us and our kids. It’s hugely important.

    "title": "Traditional long-term care policies can still work",
    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/traditional-long-term-care-policies-can-still-work-2020-09-01?mod=home-page",
    "text": "I recently wrote that the market for long-term care insurance, which was growing rapidly 20 years ago, has shrunk dramatically. When the market boomed, insurers bet that over time policyholders would let their policies lapse. Instead, many more people who had long-term care insurance (which covers the cost of skilled care and assisted living or nursing home facilities) held on to their policies, and when they tapped into them to pay for care, insurers sometimes had to pay out benefits in the six-figure range. So, the companies jacked up prices and pushed regulators for aggressive rate increases for existing customers, while many insurers stopped writing new policies altogether. But there are still some good deals for people who want traditional long-term care policies. So, I contacted Brian Gordon, president of long-term care specialist MAGA Ltd. (Murray A. Gordon Associates, not Make America Great Again). The firm, which was started by his father Murray in 1975, is based in Bannockburn, Illinois. First of all, Gordon told me, there’s a myth that Medicare covers long-term care expenses; it covers only the limited costs of recovery from acute medical conditions, like a stroke. For the rest, you’re on your own. “We’ve always told our clients to anticipate Medicare doing nothing,” he said. Medicaid does pay for long-term care, but you’ll have to spend down your own assets before you qualify, and the quality of care can leave a lot to be desired. If you’re rich, on the other hand, you can pay out of pocket. “I’ve got clients today who can buy a nursing facility. They can live there by themselves and they would still have plenty of money left,” Gordon said. Long-term care insurance is best, he told me, for people with net assets of $500,000 and up. They can’t afford to pay the entire cost of an extended nursing home stay, and long-term care insurance could help them cover their care while preserving assets to leave to their heirs. How much coverage should you look for? “Most people we work with are looking to cover anywhere from about 50% to about 75% of the cost of care,” he told me. “So, if the cost of care is, say, $10,000 a month, my clients are usually looking at between about $5,000 and about $7,500 a month in benefits.” Gordon says his clients range in age from the 40s to the 70s, although it’s harder for older people to buy long-term care policies and the premiums are much higher. “I would say somewhere in our early, mid-50s is usually a good time to buy it,” he said. How much should you pay at that time? “Our average premium on a traditional long-term care plan is probably a little bit over $3,000 a year,” he said. Gordon prepared several hypothetical quotes from a major insurer for Retirement Weekly. The premium for a 55-year-old male who buys a policy that pays $170 a day ($5,000 a month) for three years with a 3% inflation adjustment would be around $2,000 a year. A woman of the same age with the same benefits would pay $1,200 a year more. (Women live on average about five years longer than men do.) Add another year to the benefit period and the premium would be about $300 higher for the man and $700 for the woman. A shared plan for a 55-year-old female/male couple costs just over $4,200 annually for a three-year benefit period and a bit more than $5,000 for four years. That couple discount amounts to $1,000 for three years of coverage and $1,200 for four years. Big age differences between spouses make it more complicated, but in this case, you’d pay just under 20% less for a joint policy than you would for coverage of two individuals. Since women tend to be in long-term care on average 1.5 years longer than men do, a four-year benefits term makes sense for them while three years should suffice for most men. You might look for more coverage in states like Hawaii and Connecticut, where semiprivate rooms in nursing homes cost around $12,000 a month, double what they cost in Texas or Oklahoma. And though some legacy plans include inflation riders of 5%, these days paying for 3% annual inflation protection is standard. (In the five years ending in 2018, costs of long-term care rose from 2% to 3.6% annually, according to Genworth Financial.) But the best reason to buy long-term care insurance may not be financial. “It signals to the family that when our minds were good and we were healthy, we made the decision to buy this insurance,” said Gordon. “It basically tells the family it’s OK to bring in home health care and it’s OK to put them in a nursing facility.” How much is it worth to know you won’t be a burden on your loved ones when you can no longer take care of yourself? That’s the real question to ask yourself as you consider all the options to cover long-term care. Have a question about retirement, including where to retire?

    "text": "As Americans have been forced to stay at home for work, school and even visits to the doctor, shares of cloud-services providers have soared. But there’s something else going on that points to a long-term trend investors need to know about: a housing shortage outside cities, and a boom in  home renovation and improvement. But variety is the spice of life — and an excellent tool to cut risk in your investment portfolio and avoid missing out on opportunities. Of course, an excellent way to play the home construction/renovation trend is through exchange traded funds that focus on appropriate industries. So we looked to three U.S. construction and home improvement-related ETFs, combined their holdings and removed their duplicates for a list of stocks. Taking the three ETFs together and eliminating duplicate holdings, we are left with a group of 69 stocks, 42 of which have had double-digit returns this year. So here’s the entire list, sorted by how well the stocks have performed this year.

As always, if you are considering direct investments in any of the stocks listed here, you need to do your own homework to form an opinion of how well you expect the company to perform over the next several years. You can see that many of the best performers have gotten well ahead of the consensus price targets. Then again, there are 25 with majority “buy” ratings, and many are still expected by analysts to should double-digit gains over the next 12 months. Dozens of other S&P 500 companies, in contrast, have reduced their payouts. Philip van Doorn covers various investment and industry topics.

    "text": "TORONTO, Sept. 2, 2020 -- Eagle Eye Solutions, a digital global marketing technology company that helps retailers create one-to-one customer connections, and dunnhumby, the global leader in customer data science, are collaborating to enable the personalization of promotions for Southeastern Grocers, Inc. (SEG), and provide the retailer with a deeper understanding of its customers' behaviors and preferences. As part of Southeastern Grocers' journey to become a digitally enabled, omni-channel retailer, the grocer is investing to serve the needs of different customer groups and at the individual consumer level. After launching the first phase of Southeastern Grocers' omni-channel strategy in July 2020 to enable the coupons-at-receipt channel, Eagle Eye is now working with dunnhumby to improve the retailer's effectiveness of promotions across multiple channels and grow shopper loyalty. \"Our commitment to providing our customers value has never been greater or more important in today's environment. We are working hard to ensure our offers and promotions are as relevant as possible to each customer by tailoring to their spending habits and day-to-day needs,\" said Adam Kirk, SVP of Marketing at Southeastern Grocers. The ability to personalize grocer and CPG brand offers and drive effective one-to-one marketing at scale has been a long-standing challenge for retail marketers, primarily due to a lack of connected customer data and digital marketing infrastructure that can process and analyze millions of customer transactions in real time. Eagle Eye's AIR Platform powers the interactions and processing of shopper data; dunnhumby's customer data science and technology analyzes that data to determine which offers are most relevant to specific shoppers and most likely to deliver sales outcomes. \"Achieving personalization at the scale required for retailers to successfully compete for the hearts, minds, and wallets of shoppers depends on having all customer data connected with insights available in a single place. Working with Eagle Eye, we can provide SEG with intelligent analysis and recommendations to best engage with their customers to drive optimal results,\" said Jose Gomes, President of North America, for dunnhumby. Knowing which customer cohorts are likely to respond to specific deals and CPG brand offers — right down to availability at specific locations or time of day — increases promotional effectiveness and incremental spend. The collaboration paves the way for Southeastern Grocers to offer targeted promotions and rewards through its mobile app and website, and drive sales growth strategically and sustainably. \"With dunnhumby, we've accelerated execution on Southeastern Grocers' retail vision and are on track to deliver a complete omni-channel strategy in record time. Our culture of rapid innovation and the speed of implementation to date means the retailer can get much more out of the customer data they already have,\" said Tim Mason, CEO of Eagle Eye. \"Now, Southeastern Grocers can connect new channels and data to grow share of wallet by understanding customers' preferences and habits. By collaborating with dunnhumby, we can deliver offers designed to drive one more product per visit, one more item per basket, or one more visit per customer, ultimately delivering an uplift in sales.\" For more information about Eagle Eye, please contact Kelsey Dielman at [email protected].

    "text": "DUBLIN, Sept. 2, 2020 -- The \"Essential Thrombocythemia (ET) - Market Insights, Epidemiology, and Market Forecast - 2030\" drug pipelines has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. This report delivers an in-depth understanding of the Essential Thrombocythemia (ET), historical and forecasted epidemiology as well as the Essential Thrombocythemia (ET) market trends in the United States, EU5 (Germany, Spain, Italy, France, and United Kingdom) and Japan.The Essential Thrombocythemia (ET) market report provides current treatment practices, emerging drugs, and market share of the individual therapies, current and forecasted 7MM Essential Thrombocythemia (ET) market size from 2017 to 2030. The Report also covers current Essential Thrombocythemia (ET) treatment practice/algorithm, market drivers, market barriers and unmet medical needs to curate the best of the opportunities and assesses the underlying potential of the market.EpidemiologyThe disease epidemiology covered in the report provides historical as well as forecasted epidemiology segmented by Total Prevalent Population of Essential Thrombocythemia (ET), Total Prevalence of Essential Thrombocythemia Based on Symptoms, Gender-specific Diagnosed Prevalence of Essential Thrombocythemia, Age-specific Diagnosed Prevalence of Essential Thrombocythemia, Prevalence of Essential Thrombocythemia based on Risk, and Gene Mutation Specific Prevalence of Essential Thrombocythemia scenario of ET in the 7MM covering the United States, EU5 countries (Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and United Kingdom) and Japan from 2017 to 2030.Key Findings Drug ChaptersThe drug chapter segment of the Essential Thrombocythemia (ET) report encloses the detailed analysis of ET marketed drugs, mid-phase, and late-stage pipeline drugs. It also helps to understand the Essential Thrombocythemia (ET) clinical trial details, expressive pharmacological action, agreements and collaborations, approval and patent details of each included drug and the latest news and press releases.Marketed DrugsAgrylin/Xagrid: ShireAgrylin (anagrelide HCI) is the first drug approved for the treatment of Essential Thrombocythemia (ET). It is a platelet-reducing agent, with chemical name 6, 7-dichloro- 1, 5-dihydroimidazo [2, 1-b] quinazolin-2(3H)-1 monohydrochloride monohydrate. Bristol-Myers Squibb originally developed the drug, but in 1999, Roberts Pharmaceutical purchased all rights of Agrylin from them, and later Shire Plc acquired Roberts Pharmaceutical. Hence, now Shire Plc holds the rights for agrylin. The drug is approved under the name xagrid in Europe, and as agrylin in the US and Japan.Thromboreductin: AOP Orphan PharmaceuticalsThromboreductin is an innovative treatment option for patients afflicted by Essential Thrombocythemia (ET), a rare but severe bone marrow disease. The active ingredient in thromboreductin, which helps in lowering the blood platelet count and reduces the risk of complications, is anagrelide. This drug is not associated with a possible risk of leukemogenesis, as is currently the case with cytostatic agents. Treatment with this drug, if successful, could help patients have an almost normal life expectancy.Emerging DrugsRopeginterferon alfa-2b (P1101): PharmaEssentiaRopeginterferon alfa-2b (P1101) is a novel, long-acting, mono-pegylated proline interferon with improved pharmacokinetic properties offering improved tolerability and convenience. It is discovered and manufactured by PharmaEssentia in a Taichung plant, which was cGMP certified by EMA in January 2018. Ropeginterferon alfa-2b is designed to be the purer interferon-alpha designed; other interferon alphas on the market currently include PEG-Intron (Merck) and Pegasys (Roche).Jakavi (ruxolitinib): NovartisJakavi (ruxolitinib) is an oral JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor with clinical benefit in patients with other MPNs, myelofibrosis (MF), ET, and PV. It is approved by the European Commission for the treatment of adult patients with PV who are resistant to or intolerant of hydroxyurea and for the treatment of disease-related splenomegaly or symptoms in adult patients with primary MF (also known as chronic idiopathic MF), post-PV MF or post-ET MF. The exact indication for Jakavi varies by country. Novartis licensed ruxolitinib from Incyte Corporation for development and commercialization outside the United States. Jakavi is marketed in the United States by Incyte Corporation as Jakafi for patients with PV who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant of hydroxyurea.Bomedemstat (IMG-7289): Imago BioSciencesBomedemstat (IMG-7289) is a small molecule discovered by Imago BioSciences that inhibits lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1 or KDM1A), an enzyme essential for the production and normal function of megakaryocytes and self-renewal of malignant hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells. Megakaryocytes are the primary producer of platelets and cytokines that drive essential thrombocythemia pathogenesis. Currently, bomedemstat is being tested in clinical studies as a potentially disease-modifying monotherapy for MF, ET, and related indications.Market OutlookET is associated with an increased risk of thrombohemorrhagic complications and transformation to myelofibrosis (MF) or acute leukemia (AL). Cytoreductive therapy (CRT) is used to reduce thrombosis and hemorrhage in high-risk ET. The CRT treatment includes the use of CRT, anagrelide, hydroxycarbamide, busulfan, interferon- (IFN), pegylated interferon, pipobroman and sodium phosphate (P32).Low-risk patients are recommended aspirin if there are no significant contraindications for the same. There should be a careful consideration of the possibility of acquiring von Willebrand disease when platelets are more than 1,000 109/L because, in the setting of abnormal von Willebrand laboratory parameters, aspirin should not be used. Aspirin is also the indicated treatment for a patient with microvascular thrombosis such as erythromelalgia. Also, antiplatelet and cytoreductive therapy is adopted for a high-risk patient.Pregnant patients with ET are recommended to use low molecular weight heparin during pregnancy for 6 weeks after delivery in addition to cytoreduction with pegylated interferon. Also, in pregnant females who have extremely high platelets, the action of interferon is slow to bring down the platelets; plateletpheresis was reported to be an option to reduce the number of platelets.Apart from this, the other treatment recommendations in young women wishing to become pregnant or are pregnant include once-daily aspirin for very low-risk or low-risk disease and pegylated IFN- for high-risk disease. Both aspirin and IFN- therapy are safe for use during pregnancy and might be associated with lower miscarriage rates in women with ET.Key Findings Drugs UptakeThis section focusses on the rate of uptake of the potential drugs recently launched in the Essential Thrombocythemia (ET) market or expected to get launched in the market during the study period 2017-2030. The analysis covers Essential Thrombocythemia (ET) market uptake by drugs; patient uptake by therapies; and sales of each drug.This helps in understanding the drugs with the most rapid uptake, reasons behind the maximal use of new drugs and allows the comparison of the drugs based on market share and size which again will be useful in investigating factors important in market uptake and in making financial and regulatory decisions.Pipeline & Development ActivitiesThe report provides insights into different therapeutic candidates in phase II, and phase III stage. It also analyzes key players involved in developing targeted therapeutics. The report covers the detailed information of collaborations, acquisition, and merger, licensing and patent details for Essential Thrombocythemia (ET) emerging therapies.Reimbursement ScenarioApproaching reimbursement proactively can have a positive impact both during the late stages of product development and well after product launch. In the report, we take reimbursement into consideration to identify economically attractive indications and market opportunities. When working with finite resources, the ability to select the markets with the fewest reimbursement barriers can be a critical business and price strategy.Competitive Intelligence AnalysisThe publisher performs competitive and market Intelligence analysis of the Essential Thrombocythemia (ET) market by using various competitive intelligence tools that include-SWOT analysis, PESTLE analysis, Porter's five forces, BCG Matrix, Market entry strategies, etc. The inclusion of the analysis entirely depends upon the data availability.Scope of the Report For more information about this drug pipelines report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/kqrrgb Research and Markets also offers Custom Research services providing focused, comprehensive and tailored research.

    "text": "LONDON, Sept. 2, 2020 -- America's higher education system has long been the envy of the world, competing only with the UK and Europe's top universities when it comes to global reach and attracting the best student, teaching and research talent. But the Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings 2021, released today, and a recent THE survey of 200 global higher education leaders on their opinions related to the Covid-19 pandemic, suggest that outside of its elite institutions, US higher education is facing the stark reality of decline, and huge challenges if it wants to retain its position on the world stage. Commanding a record 8 of the top 10 positions in the globally-recognised rankings, it would be easy to assume that US higher education is in fine health, but evidence shows it is losing out to the rise of Chinese universities. Mainland China's Tsinghua University becomes the first ever Asian institution to break into the THE World University Rankings top 20, claiming joint 20th this year, while the country's representation in the top 100 has doubled year on year up from three in 2020 to six in 2021. In 2016, China had just two universities in the top 200, in 2021 that number stands at seven. And outside of the elite top 200 band, US institutions have been on a consistent downward trend since 2016 versus their Chinese counterparts. Infographic - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1246464/Times_Higher_Education_China_vs_US_Infographic.jpg In addition, when looking at the number of global published citations for research – a clear measure of the impact of a university's research on a global level – Chinese universities have been closing the gap on the US for some time. For the first time in the THE World University Rankings 2021, the citation score for middle-ranked Chinese and US universities have begun to converge. Infographic - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1246465/Times_Higher_Education_China_Infographic.jpg The warning signs are compounded by the threats posed by the coronavirus pandemic and the possible impact on international student movement and public funding. THE's recent survey of 200 global university leaders showed that US leaders (25 respondents) are more concerned than their global counterparts, and particularly China, when it comes to the damaging impact coronavirus could have on the sector. Just 51% of US leaders think that science and research will become significantly higher priorities for the US Government once the pandemic is over. This compares to 78% of their Chinese counterparts and 71% in the UK. Combined with concerns that science and research budgets from public and charitable sources won't rise after the pandemic (just 48% agree budgets will rise from these sources, compared to 74% in China) if the views held in the survey materialise, the US could find itself struggling to fund research compared to international colleagues. This fear is compounded by the belief by 44% of US leaders that the pandemic will reduce the government's willingness to invest in higher education over the next five years (compared to just 8% in China). Perhaps most concerning is the almost universal belief that the pandemic is likely to result in institutions going bankrupt (92% in US versus 0% in China). With research and government funding at risk, other funding sources could become vital for success. One area that leaders could turn to is international student fees, but 92% of US leaders believe Covid-19 will result in them being able to recruit fewer international students, compared to just 57% in China, and 67% in the UK, the only other nation to have institutions appear in the top 10 of the World University Rankings 2021. 64% of US leaders agree or strongly agree that this reduction will have a significant negative effect on their institution's finances and that this could be a longer-term challenge. 92% agree or strongly agree that there will be diminished student interest in studying abroad for the next five years. Together, the World University Rankings 2021 and the THE global leaders survey (conducted in May 2020) paint a worrying picture for the US that could see China's rise through the rankings accelerate and a dramatic rebalancing of the global knowledge economy in the coming years. \"The THE World University Rankings 2021 are a real wake-up call for the US higher education system, which has long dominated the global knowledge economy alongside the UK. It continues a trend over the past five years that has seen the rapid rise of China breaking into the top 100 at the expense of western institutions. The spectre of Covid-19 is yet to be seen, but it is clear from our leaders survey that without long-term commitments to funding, and an ability to reduce reliance on international student fees, China is in pole position to benefit at the expense of the United States on the global higher education stage.\" 1.  Download Full Infographic 2.  Download Infographic Social Media Assets 3.  THE Global Leaders Survey Responses 4.  Table: Top 200 – THE World University Rankings 2021 5.  Table: Full US Performance – THE World University Rankings 2021 6.  About the THE World University Rankings and Methodology 7.  View Full THE World University Rankings 2021 Table 8.  View Full THE World University Rankings Methodology THE is the trusted global data partner for higher education.  Drawing on five  decades  of expertise in the sector, millions of individual data points, more institutions participating in our flagship university rankings than  any other  and 28 million website users in 2019, we offer deeper and richer insight into university performance than anyone else.

    "text": "BOSTON, Sept. 2, 2020 -- BrickBio has demonstrated its ability to insert unnatural amino acids (UAAs), at any site, specifically, within a protein or antibody at commercial scale.  These UAAs are used to attach any molecule that may enhance the performance (such as half-life, efficacy, or improved safety) of an antibody or protein therapeutic. BrickBio retains the exclusive rights to use its technology platform for therapeutic development and production, therefore being the sole channel for pharmaceutical partnership and therapeutic development. BrickBio has put in place, and demonstrated, a well-defined conjugation platform process for the development of its lead biologic and for facilitating the work with pharmaceutical partners across partnerships deals. The platform has been validated with extensive data and has been optimized to allow ample throughput for the company's internal efforts, as well as additional capacity to undertake pharmaceutical partnerships and co-development deals. \"The BrickBio technology has rapidly evolved and grown over the last year,\" said James Italia, Vice President of Commercial Development. \"The robustness of the platform, speed of innovation, and adaptability of the technology at BrickBio has allowed the company to easily transfer the technology between multiple candidate molecules, including complex antibody scaffolds. The efficiency of the technology enables a homogenous product, thereby allowing increased effectivity of each molecule,\" Italia concluded. \"With the ability to site specifically attach molecules at any site, BrickBio's platform has the potential to revolutionize the field of protein therapeutics and antibody drug conjugates,\" stated John Boyce, President and CEO of BrickBio as well as Co-Founder of Tiger Gene. \"Both the scientific literature and the company have shown that the attachment site matters and can significantly impact the performance of a protein therapeutic,\" Boyce continued. \"The BrickBio platform has the most commercially diverse toolbox of attachment handles (UAAs), taking advantage of the largest number of sites, and as such enabling the greatest flexibility to expedite new therapeutics to patients, repurpose existing therapeutics, and rescue failed biologics,\" Boyce concluded."

    "text": "SEATTLE, Sept. 2, 2020 -- Cloudentity, a cloud-based provider of application security and identity-aware authorization solutions, announced today that it has raised $13M in Series A funding led by ForgePoint Capital, with participation from WestWave Capital. This round brings the company's total funding to $15 million. Coming off a record year of customer adoption and expansion, the new funds will be used to accelerate the company's growth and go-to-market efforts. Sean Cunningham, Managing Director at ForgePoint Capital, will join Cloudentity's board of directors. \"As enterprises move to the cloud, they are adopting distributed microservices and API-first applications, which present performance and security risks to identity and authorization platforms that are required to safely deploy applications,\" said Nathanael Coffing, Co-Founder, Cloudentity. APIs now account for over 80 percent of all web traffic and are expected to be the most frequent attack vector for data breaches by 2022. Traditional identity security approaches lack the scale and granularity to deliver the continuous user authorization required in a multi-cloud zero trust model. The problem is growing and is causing enterprises to delay release of applications or take unwanted risk. Cloudentity solves these challenges by delivering a new category of identity-aware authorization for multi-cloud environments to enable a cloud-native approach to API Access Control. Cloudentity enables continuous contextual, fine-grained authorization with policy enforcement at the API and service level. This approach allows business' development teams to adopt cloud constructs more quickly by externalizing identity and authorization. \"Emerging business models in the B2B2C and OpenBanking space necessitate API-driven distributed services protected by an authorization and governance solution like ours,\" added Coffing. \"Cloudentity sits at the convergence between Identity and Application Infrastructure, providing Continuous Contextual Authorization for zero trust API security. We are thrilled to have ForgePoint Capital and WestWave Capital behind us to help achieve this vision.\" \"We're excited to lead the Series A financing round for Cloudentity and invest in its proven team and vision for Continuous Contextual Authorization. Cloudentity has amassed significant customer and industry partnership momentum. The company is executing on the promise of scaling API security and control policies to enterprises, which helps protect its customers against the new wave of API threats,\" said Sean Cunningham, Managing Director at ForgePoint Capital. Cloudentity is a provider of Identity-Aware Authorization and Application Security solutions for the API first economy such as Open Banking. API Access Control has emerged as the next generation of Identity security allowing enterprises to protect APIs, users, and services from misuse and abuse.

    "text": "SAN MATEO, Calif., Sept. 2, 2020 -- A new study from Rakuten Ready, the leader in Order for Pickup technology, shows the growing influence on customer loyalty driven by the online pickup experience since the breakout of the COVID-19 pandemic. Since most of the United States went under Shelter In Place restrictions in March, the volume of online Order for Pickup transactions increased by over 200 percent and more than 82 percent of consumers said they have used Order for Pickup to purchase from restaurants, grocery stores and other retailers in the last six months. These findings highlight the Rakuten Ready 2020 Time Study, which provides compelling data on the progress of top Restaurants, Retailers, and Grocers in offering Order for Pickup consumer experiences so far in 2020. The study also reveals the brands that offer the shortest wait times and highlights direct correlations between customer satisfaction ratings and other factors such as safety protocols in the Order for Pickup experience. The Rakuten Ready 2020 Time Study explores findings from Rakuten Ready's exclusive data and in-person research that includes secret shopper Order for Pickup experiences at merchants in 11 major metropolitan areas in six states. \"Order for Pickup is a differentiator helping merchants enhance customer loyalty in the pandemic and will continue to provide a competitive advantage in a post-pandemic world,\" said Jaron Waldman, Co-Founder and CEO of Rakuten Ready. \"Our study underscores that merchants have a tremendous opportunity to grow traffic and revenue by redefining and optimizing their Order for Pickup experience to adjust for consumer worries and gain their trust.\" Reducing customer wait times continues to be a key factor for producing long-term customer loyalty, the study found. The pandemic has made it even more important for consumers to spend as little time as possible in stores waiting to pick up orders. This extends the trend identified in last year's report that found customers who wait under two minutes for an order are four times more likely to repeat purchase from the same retailer or restaurant. While speed is crucial to a superior Order for Pickup experience, new data in this year's Time Study suggests that brands that fall short on wait times may be able to compensate with other factors. Brand loyalty, ease of process and uniqueness/value of products also contributed to customer satisfaction for brands that scored poorly on wait times. \"Our research found that time is precious for consumers, but overall satisfaction with the Order for Pickup experience hinges on more than speed alone,\" said Waldman. \"Delivering a seamless pickup experience from start to finish is key to customer retention and satisfaction - starting from the moment a customer chooses a pickup option to the final step of safely picking up their order.\" The Rakuten Ready 2020 Time Study is available now with a look into the impact of COVID-19 on the Order for Pickup experiences of major restaurants, grocers and retailers. It shares exclusive insights and best practices for timely and safe order for pickup experiences that exceed customer expectations, grow sales and keep customers coming back.

    "text": "NANJING, China, Sept. 2, 2020 -- Magewell has introduced a trio of new models in its Pro Convert family of low-latency video-over-IP encoders and decoders. The Pro Convert 12G SDI Plus encoder converts 4K/60fps, 12G-SDI input signals into full-bandwidth NDI® streams, while the Pro Convert for NDI® to SDI and Pro Convert H.26x to SDI decoders transform NDI, H.264 or H.265 streams into high-quality SDI outputs for connection to monitors, projectors and legacy equipment. Magewell will showcase the new models in its online exhibit at the IBC Showcase virtual event from September 8 to 11, and in booth FD2-01 at the InfoComm China exhibition, scheduled for September 28 to 30 in Beijing. Magewell's Pro Convert encoders and decoders seamlessly bridge traditional video signals with IP-based production, distribution and streaming workflows, enabling existing sources and displays to work seamlessly in next-generation media infrastructures. Leveraging NewTek's popular NDI technology, Pro Convert encoders reliably bring traditional live video signals into IP-based production, remote contribution, and distribution workflows. Meanwhile, Pro Convert decoders flexibly decode a wide range of IP live media formats for applications including remote production, multi-site video distribution, digital signage, IMAG and surveillance monitoring. The plug-and-play Pro Convert 12G SDI Plus ingests video up to 4K at 60 frames per second over a single-link, 12Gbps SDI interface and converts it to full NDI streams with extremely low latency. The encoder supports up to 16 channels of embedded audio, while automatic input format detection and DHCP-based network configuration eliminate the need for manual setup. An SDI loop-through connection allows the input signal to be sent simultaneously to additional displays or equipment without external splitters or routers, enabling sources to be easily used in new IP workflows without disrupting existing traditional video infrastructure. Value-added Pro Convert 12G SDI Plus features for live production applications include program and preview tally lights; protocol conversion for NDI control of non-NDI PTZ cameras; and a standard 1/4\"-20 thread for camera mounting. The new model is the seventh Pro Convert NDI encoder, joining earlier HD and 4K models with HDMI, 6G-SDI or 3G-SDI interfaces. Magewell's duo of new Pro Convert decoders each convert input streams up to 2048x1080 at 60fps for output via a 3Gbps SDI interface. The Pro Convert H.26x to SDI decodes H.264 or H.265 compressed video streams in a wide range of streaming protocols including SRT, RTSP, RTMP, UDP, RTP and HLS, while the Pro Convert for NDI to SDI can decode all of those plus full-bandwidth NDI and high-efficiency, lower-bitrate NDI®|HX streams. The new additions also bring the Pro Convert decoder family to seven models. They join HD and 4K NDI and streaming-only models with HDMI interfaces, and the Pro Convert AIO RX NDI decoder with both HDMI and 3G-SDI outputs. \"Our Pro Convert NDI encoders and decoders were among the first products of their kind, and have earned an enviable reputation for being the most flexible and reliable such converters on the market,\" said Nick Ma, CEO and CTO at Magewell. \"We're pleased to bring these benefits to a wider range of users and equipment with our new SDI-output decoders and 12G-SDI encoder model.\" All three new Pro Convert models are scheduled to ship by the end of September.

    "text": "Attorneys Matthew Belcher and Bryant Greening, co-founders of LegalRideShare, offer some sage advice to Uber and Lyft drivers to protect themselves as independent contractors running their own company. CHICAGO, Sept. 2, 2020 --The responsibilities of being an Uber or Lyft driver go beyond taking passengers from point A to point B safely. Being a driver for one of these companies also means running your own company as an independent contractor. Many rideshare drivers are unaware of the loopholes that can cause issues down the road. Attorneys Matthew Belcher and Bryant Greening, co-founders of the law firm LegalRideshare and the nation's top experts on rideshare law, are offering important advice for new or potential rideshare drivers. Get a dash cam. Dash cams help to capture any incidents that may occur, providing unbiased information on the parties involved, and can be used as an important resource for determining who is at fault for an accident. Without video footage, claims often descend into \"he said, she said\" arguments. It can be difficult for law enforcement to determine who was at-fault, resulting in increased insurance premiums. Get a dash cam. Dash cams help to capture any incidents that may occur, providing unbiased information on the parties involved, and can be used as an important resource for determining who is at fault for an accident. Without video footage, claims often descend into \"he said, she said\" arguments. It can be difficult for law enforcement to determine who was at-fault, resulting in increased insurance premiums. Insurance is everything. Rideshare insurance varies depending on whether there's a passenger in the car or if the driver is waiting for or going to a call. Uber and Lyft provide insurance coverage when passengers are in the car, which is known as Period 3 coverage. When the driver is en route to a call, drivers are covered by Period 2 insurance. But both companies provide only limited coverage, called Period 1, when drivers are logged into their apps and waiting for a fare. It's important drivers have additional insurance to cover the gaps between periods. Advanced safety systems are a must-have.  In a recent Forbes article, attorney Bryant Greening stated, \"Advanced Driver Assistance Systems have been shown to reduce damages to property and persons, which keeps drivers on the road and able to earn. Spending a little more upfront on safety enhancements is like buying an insurance policy for when the inevitable happens. Minimizing your potential liability and damages is the name of the game.\" Advanced safety systems can include anything from, but not limited to, adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking, blind-spot detection, lane departure warning, forward and rear collision detection, among several others. Be prepared if (when) you're involved in an accident. The unfortunate reality is the longer drivers are on the road, the higher their chances are to be involved in an accident. While you may not be able to avoid the accident, there are steps you can take to make sure you know what to say and do after it occurs. These steps include filing a police report, getting the contact information from your passengers and avoiding an admission to fault. LegalRideshare covers all these tips in a handy Driver Checklist that should sit in your glovebox. Seek professional help for taxes and expenses. Being a rideshare driver means running your own business, so be informed when it comes to paying taxes. Uber and Lyft drivers, among other freelancers and independent contractors, are able to deduct 20% of their gross income from their taxable income before paying the new lower tax rates. In addition, a number of expenses can be deducted, including miles, travel, gas, the purchase of the car, et cetera. For more information, visit https://www.legalrideshare.com. LegalRideshare is the first law firm in the United States to focus exclusively on Uber®, Lyft®, and gig economy accidents and injuries. Since its inception, LegalRideshare has grown into a national brand. Its lawyers are the go-to source on rideshare-related issues, serving hundreds of clients and securing millions of dollars for injured drivers and passengers.

    "title": "Dollarama Reports Fiscal 2021 Second Quarter Results",
    "url": "https://www.prnewswire.com//news-releases/dollarama-reports-fiscal-2021-second-quarter-results-301122555.html",
    "text": "MONTREAL, Sept. 2, 2020 - Dollarama Inc. (TSX: DOL) (\"Dollarama\" or the \"Corporation\") today reported its financial results for the second quarter ended August 2, 2020. \"Our strong financial performance in the second quarter reflects Dollarama's positioning as a shopping destination of choice for Canadians from coast to coast for convenience and a compelling assortment of affordable, everyday products. Our sales were strong, driven by the demand for summer seasonal items, and store traffic improved with each month as provincial reopening plans unfolded,\" said President and CEO Neil Rossy. \"All of our stores were open to serve customers entering the third quarter and we continue to closely monitor consumer shopping patterns to ensure our store offering remains relevant to Canadian families in the evolving socio-economic environment shaped by the pandemic. The health and safety of our employees and customers remain paramount. We will diligently maintain our COVID-19 operating procedures and health and safety measures in accordance with public health directives and as the situation continues to evolve,\" added Mr. Rossy. We refer the reader to the notes in the section entitled \"Selected Consolidated Financial Information\" of this press release for the definition of these items and, when applicable, their reconciliation with the most directly comparable GAAP measure. All comparative figures that follow are for the second quarter ended August 2, 2020 compared to the second quarter ended August 4, 2019. All financial information presented in this press release has been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in Canada (\"GAAP\") as set out in the CPA Canada Handbook – Accounting under Part I, which incorporates International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\") as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (\"IASB\"). Throughout this press release, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, total debt and net debt, which are referred to as \"non-GAAP measures\", are used to provide a better understanding of the Corporation's financial results. For a full explanation of the Corporation's use of non-GAAP measures, please refer to footnote 1 of the \"Selected Consolidated Financial Information\" section of this press release. Throughout this press release, all references to \"Fiscal 2020\" are to the Corporation's fiscal year ended February 2, 2020, and to \"Fiscal 2021\" are to the Corporation's fiscal year ending January 31, 2021. Sales for the second quarter of Fiscal 2021 increased by 7.1% to $1,013.6 million, compared to $946.4 million in the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. The increase in sales is attributable to the growth in the total number of stores over the past twelve months, from 1,250 stores on August 4, 2019 to 1,314 stores on August 2, 2020, and to an increase in comparable store sales, driven by higher sales of summer seasonal items as well as household and cleaning products. This was partially offset by lower in-store traffic, a reduction in demand for certain product categories, such as party supplies and greeting cards, and reduced opening hours in some locations. At the beginning of the second quarter, 104 stores remained temporarily closed due to government- mandated closures, primarily in Quebec malls. In addition, about 84% of stores were operating with reduced hours to allow more time for re-stocking outside of opening hours and due to mandated closures on Sundays in Quebec. Over the course of the quarter, provincial governments began to lift certain restrictions resulting in the re-opening of enclosed-mall stores, the resumption of operations on Sundays in Quebec, coupled with a gradual return to regular opening hours in all markets. By June 19, 2020, all Dollarama stores were open but 107 were still operating with a 10% or more reduction in opening hours. As a result, there was a gradual increase in store traffic throughout the quarter. However, customer habits continued to be impacted by the pandemic and the various public health measures in place, including physical distancing. Comparable store sales excluding temporarily closed stores grew 5.4%, consisting of a 41.7% increase in average transaction size and a 25.7% decrease in the number of transactions. Customers reduced the frequency of store visits but purchased larger quantities of goods at one time. Comparable store sales were negatively impacted by low traffic in stores located in malls and which remained open across Canada for the convenience of customers. Comparable store sales including temporarily closed stores grew 2.5%. Gross margin was 43.9% of sales in the second quarter of Fiscal 2021, compared to 43.7% of sales in the second quarter of Fiscal 2020. Gross margin was slightly higher quarter over quarter due to higher sales of higher margin products, namely summer seasonal items, and the positive impact of scaling. This increase was partially offset by incremental direct costs related to COVID-19 measures implemented throughout Dollarama's operations, including in its logistics chain, representing approximately $1.9 million in cost of goods sold and a 20 basis-point impact. General, administrative and store operating expenses (\"SG&A\") for the second quarter of Fiscal 2021 increased by 28.5% to $169.3 million, compared to $131.7 million for the second quarter of Fiscal 2020. SG&A for the second quarter of Fiscal 2021 represented 16.7% of sales, compared to 13.9% of sales for the second quarter of Fiscal 2020. This 2.8% variance mainly reflects the equivalent of an additional shift in each store to staff a dedicated position responsible for limiting the number of customers in-store at one time and for the execution of additional cleaning and physical distancing measures, as well as temporary wage increases for store employees (effective March 23, 2020, and extended to August 2, 2020), amounting to approximately $32.4 million in total and representing a 320 basis-point impact. SG&A was positively impacted by higher labour productivity in stores due to the processing of fewer transactions but larger baskets. Incremental direct costs related to COVID-19 measures implemented by Dollarama to support employees and protect the health and safety of customers and employees are estimated at approximately $34.3 million in the second quarter of Fiscal 2021. This amount does not reflect any indirect costs related to COVID-19 such as lost sales and changes in the sales mix. For the second quarter of Fiscal 2021, the Corporation's 50.1% share of Dollarcity's net earnings for the period from April 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020, was $2.5 million. The Corporation's investment in Dollarcity is accounted for as a joint arrangement using the equity method. Financing costs decreased by $2.0 million, from $24.6 million for the second quarter of Fiscal 2020 to $22.6 million for the second quarter of Fiscal 2021. The decrease is mainly due to a lower average borrowing rate following the implementation of the commercial paper program in the United States. Net earnings were $142.5 million, or $0.46 per diluted common share, in the second quarter of Fiscal 2021, compared to $143.2 million, or $0.45 per diluted common share, in the second quarter of Fiscal 2020. Net earnings in the second quarter of Fiscal 2021 reflect higher sales and improved gross margin, offset by the incremental, direct costs incurred in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. Capital expenditures increased by $4.1 million, from $30.4 million for the second quarter of Fiscal 2020 to $34.5 million for the second quarter of Fiscal 2021. This increase reflects additional store-related transformational capital expenditures, including but not limited to, the purchase of additional self-checkout machines for certain high-traffic locations across the network, the continued roll-out of security cameras, and other store optimization projects. At its latest quarter ended June 30, 2020, Dollarcity had a total of 232 stores with 121 locations in Colombia, 48 in El Salvador and 63 in Guatemala. This compares to a total of 228 stores as at December 31, 2019. Due to strict COVID-19 confinement measures and other related restrictions, no new stores were opened in the quarter. Dollarcity was recognized as an essential business in all three countries of operations from the outset of the pandemic. As at June 30, 2020, Dollarcity had only 2 temporarily closed stores, compared to 40 in mid-March 2020. As at June 30, 2020, 42 stores were operating with reduced opening hours. Based on Dollarcity's preliminary unaudited financial statements for the 12-month period ended June 30, 2020, the estimated purchase price for the Corporation's 50.1% interest in Dollarcity has been adjusted to US$92.7 million ($123.5 million) from the previously reported estimate of US$80.4 million as at May 3, 2020. A gradual lifting of strict government-mandated confinement measures in countries of operation and an increase in store opening hours during the course of Dollarcity's latest quarter ended June 30, 2020 resulted in higher sales, EBITDA and lower debt levels than previously forecasted and anticipated in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The adjustment to the estimated purchase price is reflected in the cost of the equity-accounted investment on the statement of financial position. Dollarama made an upfront cash payment of US$40.0 million ($52.8 million) when it acquired its 50.1% interest on August 14, 2019. As such, based on the latest adjustment, the remaining balance of the purchase price is estimated at US$52.7 million ($70.7 million). It is recorded in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and will be due, subject to final adjustments following completion of the audit of results for the 12-month period ended June 30, 2020, in the third quarter of Fiscal 2021. On September 2, 2020, the Corporation announced that its Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend for holders of common shares of $0.044 per common share. This dividend is payable on November 6, 2020 to shareholders of record at the close of business on October 9, 2020. The dividend is designated as an \"eligible dividend\" for Canadian tax purposes. On July 3, 2020, the Corporation announced the renewal of its normal course issuer bid and the approval from the Toronto Stock Exchange to repurchase for cancellation up to 15,548,326 common shares, representing 5.0% of the common shares issued and outstanding as at the close of markets on June 30, 2020, during the 12-month period from July 7, 2020 to July 6, 2021. No common shares were repurchased for cancellation under the normal course issuer bid since the beginning of the fiscal year as the Corporation chose to preserve liquidity due to the uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic. As at August 2, 2020, the Corporation's adjusted net debt to EBITDA ratio stood at 2.80x, a 14 basis-point improvement over the ratio of 2.94x at the end of the first quarter of Fiscal 2021. Due to the uncertainty related to COVID-19, including its duration, severity, the scope of government-mandated measures in the event of a potential second wave and the extent of its public health and economic impacts on the Corporation's operations and future financial performance, the Corporation does not provide guidance for Fiscal 2021.

The forward-looking statements contained in this press release are expressly qualified by this cautionary statement. Dollarama will hold a conference call to discuss its Fiscal 2021 second quarter results today, September 2, 2020 at 10:30 a.m. (ET). Financial analysts are invited to ask questions during the call.

Non-GAAP measures are not generally accepted measures under GAAP and do not have a standardized meaning under GAAP. EBITDA, EBITDA margin, total debt and net debt are reconciled below. The non-GAAP measures, as calculated by the Corporation, may not be comparable to those of other issuers and should be considered as a supplement to, not a substitute for, or superior to, the comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We have included non-GAAP measures to provide investors with supplemental measures of our operating and financial performance. We believe that non-GAAP measures are important supplemental metrics of operating and financial performance because they eliminate items that have less bearing on our operating and financial performance and thus highlight trends in our core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP measures. We also believe that securities analysts, investors and other interested parties frequently use non-GAAP measures in the evaluation of issuers, many of which present non-GAAP measures when reporting their results. Our management also uses non-GAAP measures in order to facilitate operating and financial performance comparisons from period to period, to prepare annual budgets, and to assess our ability to meet our future debt service, capital expenditure and working capital requirements. 27.4% 29.8% 26.5% 28.6% Fixed annual rate of 3.55% payable in equal semi-annual instalments,maturing November 6, 2023 Fixed annual rate of 2.203% payable in equal semi-annual instalments,maturing November 10, 2022 Fixed annual rate of 2.337% payable in equal semi-annual instalments, maturing July 22, 2021 Comparable store sales growth is a measure of the percentage increase or decrease, as applicable, of the sales of stores, including relocated and expanded stores, open for at least 13 complete fiscal months relative to the same period in the prior fiscal year. For the first and second quarters of Fiscal 2021, comparable store sales growth excludes temporarily closed stores. Gross margin represents gross profit divided by sales. SG&A as a percentage of sales represents SG&A divided by sales. Operating margin represents operating income divided by sales. EBITDA margin represents EBITDA divided by sales.

(\"NioCorp\" or the \"Company\") (TSX: NB;OTCQX: NIOBF) is pleased to announce that the Company's Elk Creek Superalloy Materials Project (the \"Elk Creek Project\") will be presented on September 17, 2020, at the 2020 Global Infrastructure Leadership Forum (the \"Forum\"). CEO and Executive Chairman Mark A. Smith will present on the Elk Creek Project as part of a panel entitled \"Reshoring the Supply Chain - The Strategic Metal Initiative.\"  The panel begins at 1:00 PM Eastern as part of Track B of the Forum.  The agenda for the event can be seen here.  Participation in the Forum will be virtual and is open only to paid conference participants. Mr. Smith will address how the critical minerals that NioCorp plans to produce at its Elk Creek Project -- once funded, constructed, and operational – can advance various infrastructure projects, reduce construction and maintenance costs of large-scale infrastructure projects, lessen environmental impacts, and catalyze additional investment in U.S.-based critical materials supply chains. Others participating in the conference include the following:  Fox Business News anchor Maria Bartiromo, former CIA Director General David Petraeus, business leader Hank Greenberg, and others.  The annual conference brings together leaders from several dozen strategic projects in the global infrastructure sector, including those in mining/strategic materials, energy, transportation, water/wastewater, digitization, and others. NioCorp was selected to present at the Forum because it is positioned to inaugurate the first-ever U.S.-based production of two strategic metals – niobium and scandium – that are used, or are expected to be used, in infrastructure and transportation applications.  These metals also have been designated as \"critical minerals\" for the U.S. by the Trump Administration.  The Project also plans to produce titanium, another \"critical mineral\" as defined by the U.S. Government. As the highest-grade niobium project in North America, and one of the largest prospective producers of scandium in the world, the Elk Creek Project is one of the few pure-play critical minerals projects in the U.S. that has completed a NI-43-101 Feasibility Study, secured key federal and state permits, and placed significant percentages of its principal products under commercial sales agreements.

Niobium is used to produce superalloys as well as High Strength, Low Alloy (\"HSLA\") steel, which is a lighter, stronger steel used in automotive, structural, and pipeline applications.  Scandium is a superalloy material that can be combined with Aluminum to make alloys with increased strength and improved corrosion resistance.  Scandium also is a critical component of advanced solid oxide fuel cells.  Titanium is used in various superalloys and is a key component of pigments used in paper, paint and plastics and is also used for aerospace applications, armor and medical implants.

PrizePicks continues to expand their presence in the Southeast, having already secured a similar marketing deal with the Miami Marlins earlier this season. This is the latest in a growing variety of creative partnerships the up-and-coming DFS operator has pursued including deals with the American Cornhole League, The Outlaw Golf Tour, and the SMITE Pro League (esports) all within the past 12 months. PrizePicks continues to expand their presence in the Southeast, having already secured a similar marketing deal with the Miami Marlins earlier this season. This is the latest in a growing variety of creative partnerships the up-and-coming DFS operator has pursued including deals with the American Cornhole League, The Outlaw Golf Tour, and the SMITE Pro League (esports) all within the past 12 months. Through this partnership, Braves fans can fully engage with the games without being inside Truist Park this season. The Braves will encourage their fans to play PrizePicks - the easiest, fastest and most fun form of DFS - alongside their TV viewing experience. PrizePicks has reached new all-time daily, weekly & monthly highs since the return of live sports, and this partnership will further that growth. \"There's nothing better than partnering with our hometown team, a perennial winner and the pro sports team with the largest reach across the South,\" said PrizePicks Founder and CEO Adam Wexler. \"As a company headquartered in Atlanta, we have big plans for building a premium sports brand in the city, state and region. The Braves cover all the bases.\" Prior to this significant development, PrizePicks had partnered with Braves legend Andruw Jones in the Fall of 2019. Jones, who played 12 seasons with the Braves in Atlanta, knew PrizePicks was set to build a major platform & brand when he became a shareholder a year ago. \"Their market is on fire, and they have a product I knew could be huge from the moment I saw it,\" said Jones, a five-time All-Star and ten-time Gold Glove award winner. \"Seeing the Braves partner with PrizePicks was only a matter of time, and it's great to know my former team sees the potential in the company just like I do. Their industry will see massive growth in the coming years.\" With Andruw's help, PrizePicks facilitated a Celeb Pick 'em Challenge for Charity last NFL season with other Braves legends, MLB All-Stars and former NFL All-Pros: https://partners.myprizepicks.com/vicks-picks The company plans to bring back the format in the coming weeks when the NFL returns.

    "url": "https://www.prnewswire.com//news-releases/bergacyn-ff-can-help-reduce-liver-fat-weight-in-non-diabetics-301122809.html",
    "text": "LANDING, N.J., Sept. 2, 2020 -- In a new randomized clinical trial of non-diabetic subjects older than 50 years, DolCas Biotech, LLC's Bergacyn FF® demonstrated an ability to help reduce liver fat and body weight. This hallmark study follows previous investigation that supported Bergacyn's liver-fat lowering effects in subjects with diabetes while providing extra cardioprotective support. Non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL or steatosis) and the disease states it propagates currently affects upwards of two billion people worldwide — more people than in China and the US, combined. Although NAFLD can occur at any age, people are more likely to develop it as they age, with those in the age group of 40-60 years as a majority. It's an epidemic people are only beginning to become aware of, as its lack of early symptoms and complicating role in many chronic diseases positions it to cripple economies. Non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL or steatosis) and the disease states it propagates currently affects upwards of two billion people worldwide — more people than in China and the US, combined. Although NAFLD can occur at any age, people are more likely to develop it as they age, with those in the age group of 40-60 years as a majority. It's an epidemic people are only beginning to become aware of, as its lack of early symptoms and complicating role in many chronic diseases positions it to cripple economies. NAFL is a lifestyle-linked process, driven by the excess consumption of fat, sugar and calories, as well as a sedentary lifestyle. Complications are extensive, affecting systems beyond the liver, including the heart and vascular systems and kidneys. It significantly impacts the onset and progression of diabetes. Weight loss and lifestyle change are the best ways to modulate the development and progression of fatty liver, but compliance is often an issue. The study was conducted at the University Magna Grecia, Catanzaro, Italy, and published on August 11, 2020, in the journal Frontiers in Endocrinology. A total of 102 mildly hypercholesterolemic patients, age 35-70 and with liver steatosis, were enrolled in a double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial and randomized to receive 600 mg/d of either Bergacyn FF or a maltodextrin-based placebo. As dietary changes and resultant weight loss are known to contribute to liver-fat regression, overweight and obese subjects in both groups were assigned the task of reducing their intake by 400-500 calories per day. Results of the study, completed by 86 subjects, revealed that liver fat accumulation was reduced by 9% (p< 0.05) over the placebo group. Bergacyn FF also produced a significant positive factor in its potential to regress the progression of fatty liver, especially considering that the cutoffs for each stage differ by wide margins. Notably, in those subjects over 50 years of age, the reduction in liver fat was even more remarkable at 15% (p<0.05) greater than the placebo and was attributed solely to Bergacyn FF, and not the dietary changes. Subgroup analyses showed that Bergacyn FF produced more profound benefits over placebo not only for subjects older than 50, but for women and overweight/obese persons having an android \"apple\" shape phenotype. \"An unexpected outcome of the study was Bergacyn's impact on weight loss,\" remarks Dr. Shavon Jackson-Michel, Director of Medical & Scientific Affairs of DolCas Biotech. \"The absolute difference made by Bergacyn FF for body weight reductions over placebo was approximately 4 lbs. The total weight loss in the Bergacyn FF group over 12 weeks fell just under 10 lbs. The new research supports the traditional wisdom of botanical synergism and how standardized ingredient formulations could be the best way forward for multifactorial processes such as NAFL.\" To learn more, please register for the live webinar on Tuesday, September 8, 2020 at 10am EDT (4pm BST/UK). Bergacyn FF, formally marketed as Bergacyn®, combines bergamot fibers to synergize the ingredient blend and contribute to its free-flow in hopper-to-bottle processing. Bergamot fibers at 50% concentration round out the unique profile of bergamot polyphenols and artichoke sesquiterpenes, (including cynaropicrin) in their ability to target fat accumulation in the liver and control the inflammatory process that results from its infiltration. Bergacyn FF, is a clean-label powerhouse blend of botanical extracts derived from the Italian bergamot citrus fruit (Citrus bergamia) and the wild Italian artichoke thistle leaf (Cynara cardunculus sylvestris). The new patented formulation is free of any solvents or excipients and the Bergamot juice and pulp serve as upcycled source materials to provide the polyphenols and fiber in Bergacyn FF. It enables a very-low effective dose, compared to other nutraceutical interventions targeting the fatty liver process. DolCas Biotech has a proven track record of success positioning curcumin products in the global nutraceuticals market, amassing nearly a decade of experience of successful commercialization within the branded curcumin space.

    "text": "BELLEVUE, Wash., Sept. 2, 2020 -- Pet Partners, the nation's leading organization registering therapy animals for animal-assisted interventions (AAI), is excited to announce its third annual World's Largest Pet Walk, set for Saturday, September 26, 2020. Sponsored by VCA Animal Hospitals, this event invites people around the world to get out their walking shoes and grab their leashes for Pet Partners' signature walking event. World's Largest Pet Walk is for anyone who wants to celebrate the health benefits of being active with pets, while also fundraising to support Pet Partners and their Therapy Animal Program. \"This event is a great way for people from all walks of life to join in on the fun and exercise with their pets,\" said Annie Peters, President and CEO of Pet Partners. \"The animals in our lives are often strong motivators to keep moving! In fact, regularly walking with our pets is associated with more physical activity, better health, and fewer doctor visits.\" Participants are encouraged to walk at any time and location on Saturday, September 26, choosing a distance and path that feels right for them and their animals. \"Whether you gather some friends and family for a stroll around the block or take a quiet hike just you and your animal, we want to see you taking steps with your pets,\" said Peters. Participants are encouraged to get outside and walk. While Pet Partners already promotes its Walk With Me™ initiative in which therapy animal teams coordinate walks with people in their community, World's Largest Pet Walk was created to encourage worldwide participation with or without therapy animal teams, all on one specific day. One of the features of the World's Largest Pet Walk is that it can be set up in a way that works for all participants, including solo or socially distanced walking to support safe participation. Whether people walk individually, with family, or with a group, social distancing and face coverings are encouraged  and participants should follow local health guidance. According to a study conducted by the Human-Animal Bond Research Institute (HABRI) and Cohen Research Group, 97 percent of doctors reported there are health benefits from owning a pet and 75 percent of doctors saw an overall improvement in health as a result of pet ownership. \"Pets improve our health while enhancing our quality of life,\" said Dr. Todd Lavender, president of VCA Animal Hospitals and Petcare Services. \"Over the past few months, daily walk routines have become more meaningful and valuable than ever. We are proud to support Pet Partners in celebrating this treasured tradition nationwide on September 26.\" There is no registration fee to walk in the World's Largest Pet Walk, but Pet Partners encourages supporters to fundraise in honor of their participation. Those interested can visit www.worldslargestpetwalk.org to learn more, sign up, and create their online fundraising page. As a special thank you to those who fundraise, Pet Partners is offering incentives for walkers and their pets including pet bandanas, T-shirts, and leashes. Funds raised through the World's Largest Pet Walk support Pet Partners' Therapy Animal Program, which is made up of therapy animal teams who bring comfort and relief to members of the public, typically in facility settings such as hospitals, nursing homes, schools, libraries, airports, and at workplace well-being events. Pet Partners teams make more than three million visits per year, touching hearts and impacting lives around the world. Pet Partners encourages participants to share photos of their walk on social media using the hashtag #WorldsLargestPetWalk. There is also a downloadable event bib for anyone planning to participate.

    "text": "FORT WORTH, Texas, Sept. 2, 2020 -- Today, pharmacy software providers FDS, Inc. and Amplicare announced a strategic merger as an unprecedented move to support the acceleration of pharmacies as essential healthcare providers. With the merger, FDS clients will have access to Amplicare's industry-leading platform including Medicare plan comparison and eligibility tools that empower pharmacy patients to make better healthcare plan decisions. Amplicare clients will now be able to take advantage of FDS's best-in-class New Era Pharmacy platform with software solutions that enable clinical care, improve financial health, and offer valuable data insights into pharmacy operations. In today's environment, Medicare and Medicaid patients often find themselves without the tools or information they need to make the right decisions about their insurance plans. With the merger of FDS and Amplicare, those tools are now available to thousands more pharmacy patients. Both companies are aligned in their efforts to extend care to patients and foster better relationships between pharmacies and their communities. Their merger furthers the concept of the New Era Pharmacy — a pharmacy that has evolved beyond primarily filling and billing prescriptions to function as a comprehensive care provider for its community. \"With FDS and Amplicare joining together, our two companies are more than just the sum of our parts,\" said FDS CEO Adam McMullin. \"Our customers have long asked for the types of solutions Amplicare provides, and now we can offer those to them while also providing Amplicare customers with our world-class financial, clinical, and business intelligence solutions. With their help, our New Era Pharmacy platform can improve the health of more pharmacies and patients than ever before.\" \"Pharmacies are doing more for their communities than ever before,\" added McMullin. \"They've set a new standard, and we want to do everything we can to support them.\" \"Amplicare has a proven record of enabling pharmacies and their patients to make data-driven decisions,\" said Amplicare CEO J. Bennet Waters. \"We are eager to integrate Amplicare's capabilities into FDS' existing solutions, and we are very confident in the power of these combined organizations. Among other observations, COVID-19 has made it clear that pharmacies have critical roles to play in the continuing digital transformation of healthcare, and we are excited to expand the tools we provide to pharmacists and the patients they serve.\" As pharmacies expand into providing vital patient care services — like point-of-care testing and immunizations — for their communities, they find their workload increasing to unmanageable levels. Pharmacy software solutions, like those provided by FDS and Amplicare, make pharmacy operations more efficient and more productive. The merger of the two software providers will greatly expand the capabilities of their pharmacy clients. While terms of the deal were not announced, the merger is effective immediately.  McMullin will continue to serve as Chief Executive Officer of the combined organization, now serving over 15,500 pharmacies nationwide. The company will remain based in Fort Worth, TX with additional locations in New York City and Columbia, MD. About FDS, Inc.: FDS strengthens the health of pharmacies and their patients. We empower community pharmacies to build the clinically focused New Era Pharmacy, enabling their business to thrive now and successfully transition to a provider of community and population health through data insights, purpose-built technology solutions, and clinical services enablement.

The plant had been out of service following a fire in September 2019. Reconstruction was completed in late July and the plant was re-commissioned, tested and returned to service on August 20, 2020. The cost of new equipment and repairs to the plant was in line with the Company's estimate and Cadillac has been operating well since its return to service. The Company expects that it will settle the Cadillac insurance claim by the end of September, which would allow it to record business interruption insurance recoveries to income in the third quarter of 2020. Oxnard is an approximately 49 megawatt gas-fired plant located in Oxnard, California. The plant is currently operating under a Reliability Must Run (RMR) agreement with the California Independent System Operator through December 31, 2020. The RMR agreement is based on the plant's cost of service and is subject to the approval of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), which is pending. On August 28, 2020, the Company executed an agreement to sell Resource Adequacy (RA) capacity from the Oxnard plant effective January 1, 2021 through December 31, 2021. Capacity provided under the agreement will be used to satisfy the load obligations of a community choice aggregator. Under the RA agreement, Oxnard will receive a fixed monthly capacity payment. The capacity payment alone represents an improved outcome compared to a potential RMR alternative for 2021. The RA agreement also provides the opportunity for the plant to receive revenue from the potential sale of energy and ancillary services as well as other non-capacity revenues. The Company expects a modest level of Project Adjusted EBITDA from Oxnard in 2021. \"The improvement in market conditions in California over the past couple of months made the RA agreement an attractive option for Oxnard,\" said Joe Cofelice, Executive Vice President—Commercial Development of Atlantic Power. \"Recent events in that market demonstrate the importance of firm and flexible generation in meeting electric demand and supporting the continued deployment of renewable generation.\" Atlantic Power is an independent power producer that owns power generation assets in eleven states in the United States and two provinces in Canada. The Company's generation projects sell electricity and steam to investment-grade utilities and other creditworthy large customers predominantly under long–term PPAs that have expiration dates ranging from 2020 to 2043. The Company seeks to minimize its exposure to commodity prices through provisions in the contracts, fuel supply agreements and hedging arrangements. The projects are diversified by geography, fuel type, technology, dispatch profile and offtaker (customer). Approximately 75% of the projects in operation are 100% owned and directly operated and maintained by the Company. The Company has expertise in operating most fuel types, including gas, hydro, and biomass, and it owns a 40% interest in one coal project.

    "text": "IRVINE, Calif., Sept. 2, 2020 -- Tax returns can be complex, especially for large domestic and international businesses or individual taxpayers with lots of offshore bank and financial accounts & offshore businesses or investments. As such, it is not uncommon for taxpayers, even those who have had \"professional\" help filling out their returns, to make a mistake that they may not notice until they are going over their forms again after they have been submitted, especially where you have changed tax preparers. If amending your return changes the amount of tax due by a substantial amount you run the risk of sparking an audit or criminal tax investigation.  If your tax goes up the state or federal government might suspect that you cheated on the original return by omitting income or by claiming deductions or credits for which you are entitled.  If your tax goes down, they might infer the opposite – that you are cheating in the act of filing an amended return.  The very act of amending a return can be construed as a criminal admission by a federal or state taxing authority in certain circumstances.   Therefore, it's an excellent  idea to contact an experienced dual licensed Tax Attorney and CPA like those at the Tax Law Offices of David W. Klasing before choosing to submit amended returns so we can keep you out of trouble. If the original returns were false and you willfully filed them nonetheless, you are wise to submit an amended return before the IRS catches it and opens a high-risk eggshell audit or criminal tax investigation to avoid facing serious civil fines and even criminal tax prosecution and restitution. Where undisclosed foreign accounts or unreported offshore income generating assets are involved or a large amount of domestic tax has been underreported over several years in a consistently deceptive manner, a domestic or offshore voluntary disclosure program may be the better option for you in order to simultaneously receive a nearly guaranteed pass on criminal tax prosecution and to minimize any potential civil penalties involved and achieve a certain degree of certainty in the process.

    "text": "CLEVELAND, Sept. 2, 2020 -- A new national survey by Cleveland Clinic reveals that the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting both the mental and physical health of men and as a result, some men are negatively impacted while others are making healthier choices. In an online survey among approximately 1,000 U.S. males 18 years or older, Cleveland Clinic found that 77 percent of men report their stress level has increased as a result of COVID-19, 59 percent of men have felt isolated during the pandemic and nearly half (45 percent) of men say their emotional/mental health has worsened during the pandemic. The survey was issued as part of Cleveland Clinic's fifth annual educational campaign, \"MENtion It®,\" which aims to address the fact that men often do not \"MENtion\" health issues or take steps to prevent them. This year, Cleveland Clinic set out to see what sort of effect the pandemic has had on men over the past six months and what their outlook is looking forward. \"We couldn't take the temperature on the state of men's health this year without focusing on the one thing that has affected every person in this country and beyond,\" said Eric Klein, M.D., chairman of Cleveland Clinic's Glickman Urological & Kidney Institute. \"Many men are finding themselves in new and different roles as a result of this pandemic; for example, they are out of work or are working around the clock at home looking after kids with their partners all while worrying about their family's health and their own health. It's no surprise that mental health rose to the top as a critical issue in this year's survey.\" \"We want to remind men that their health shouldn't take a back seat, especially during a pandemic,\" said Dr. Klein. \"If you're experiencing symptoms that indicate a real health issue, don't be afraid to come to the hospital or schedule an appointment with a healthcare provider, either virtually or in person. Your health is too important not to.\" Visit www.clevelandclinic.org/MENtionIt for more information about men's health and important preventive steps every man can take.

    "text": "- Iridium Quant Lens shows that Investor Relations (IR) adds up to 24.2% of GCC bank valuations DUBAI, UAE, Sept. 2, 2020 -- The quality of investor relations can add up to 24.2 percent to a listed company's market capitalization, according to a new data science project by Iridium Advisors that uses four different Machine Learning algorithms to calculate the impact of 30 financial and non-financial valuation drivers. Oliver Schutzmann, CEO of Iridium Advisors, said: \"Many boards and management teams in emerging markets have not yet invested sufficiently in investor relations because they do not fully understand the value it adds. To this background, we sought to take a scientific and systematic approach to show how the business value they create can be translated into market value, and thereby quantify the value of investor relations.  With the insights gained from Iridium Quant Lens Machine Learning algorithms, we can now help business leaders understand what exactly drives their market value and show them how to unlock material valuation potential.\" The Iridium Quant Lens machine learning (ML) platform was built on the foundations of classic finance theory that a company's stock price is derived through an evaluation of risk relative to return factors by equity market participants. In order to identify the financial and non-financial drivers of bank valuations, four different machine learning algorithms were deployed to consider 30 risk and return metrics, compiled from over 9 million data points, and covering 673 banks globally.  The Quant Lens algorithms were run separately for all banks and for 65 GCC banks over different time horizons ranging from 1 to 10 years. Iridium's algorithms proved successful in decomposing valuation drivers and, in aggregate, explained 86% of valuation variability for the test data set and 91 percent of the full data set.  Furthermore, some individual models, such as the 3-year models for GCC banks, explained up 95 percent of the test data set and 98 percent of the full data set. A significant finding of this study was that the quality of investor relations – based on the classification into IR-Agnostic, IR-Basic and IR-Emerging archetypes -  is a highly material factor consistently influencing valuations of GCC banks. In fact, for most models it was the third most important factor impacting price to tangible book value (P/TBV) and explained 6% of share price variability on average. In addition, the impact of upgrading investor relations is significant, with each upgrade step in a 2-stage upgrade path, commanding a 12 percent valuation premium on average and a complete move along the investor relations upgrade path adding 24 percent to market capitalization. To illustrate the impact of IR Quality with real-world examples, one bank (Bank A) currently operates at an 'IR-Emerging' level which adds 0.16x to its P/TBV valuation. Given the bank's current market capitalization of USD 33 billion, this translates to almost USD 3 billion of its market value, or the equivalent of USD 220 million in net profits. Considering the valuation uplift achieved by the 'IR-Emerging\" level this is a compelling return on investment, being typically achievable with a USD 1.0 million annual IR budget. The converse is true for low IR quality.  Bank X currently operates at an 'IR-Agnostic' level, which in fact subtracts -0.07x from its P/TBV valuation.

    "text": "DUBLIN, Sept. 2, 2020 -- The \"Molecular Diagnostics Markets in the COVID-19 Era (Markets for Molecular COVID-19 IVD Tests, Respiratory Tests, Blood Screening, Cancer Markers and Other IVD Tests)\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. Now more than ever, molecular diagnostics are the most important part of in vitro diagnostics. The analyst has, for many years, estimated the size of and forecasted the growth of the worldwide market for molecular diagnostics in all major segments, and does so in this edition as a pandemic has reached developed markets including the United States. 2020 was set to be a year of growth and innovations in molecular diagnostics under any circumstances. New products, higher growth than other in vitro diagnostic categories, continued acceptance of next-generation sequencing methods were driving. Liquid biopsy technologies and the increased use of predictive genetic tests were and still are areas of anticipated revenue growth. The sudden onset of SARS-CoV-2 and the resulting disease COVID-19 put the world's focus on molecular diagnostics in an unexpected way. This will not be universally the case. In non-COVID-19 testing areas, such as cancer and inherited diseases, molecular diagnostics vendors need to continue to persuade. Here volumes may be reduced by social distancing measures. But they are expected to continue to make progress converting laboratory customers. New technologies such as molecular near-patient and next-generation sequencing are increasingly part of the mix. The report details these trends. There has also been a huge influx of product introductions from small, obscure companies. These have mostly targeted the low end of the price range and often had poor performance, while a small number of high-end automated systems are mostly limited to certain segments of the market, such as independent reference laboratories and centralized hospital laboratories. Low-quality products from fly-by-night companies are the predictable result of the shortages and the relatively basic resources needed to produce mediocre antibody test kits with a low level of quality control. A few major companies are seeing the most test runs, particularly in the United States.COVID-19 testing has also been a bit of a double-edged sword for labs generally, for in vitro diagnostics and for molecular tests. Boosting volumes in infectious disease have been notably paired with drops due to social distancing measures and hospital surgical postponements. What is the result? The report helps to sort out the array of news and reports about the current state of molecular diagnostics, reasonable global estimates for COVID, and the impact of COVID-19 on the rest of molecular testing.The report covers the global markets. For All Markets, the analyst provides the following: The analyst has monitored 2020 secondary sources, trade publications, medical journals, government websites and policy documents, as well as financial statements from vendors to assess the market impact of COVID-19. In addition, the analyst has been tracking lab volumes with a survey since mid-April, and the analyst U.S. MasterFile product was used to keep track of instrument trends.Key Topics Covered For more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/qdl3s6 Research and Markets also offers Custom Research services providing focused, comprehensive and tailored research.

ParkMobile 360 will enable the cities to have a single view of data across the different parking technologies including meters, enforcement solutions and permits. By consolidating the parking data in one place, ParkMobile 360 provides cities with an easy way to track the results for the entire parking operation, including data on parking transactions, payments and citations. ParkMobile 360 will also enable cities to centrally manage all parking rates and policies in the platform and then push that information out to the different technologies. In recent years, as cities across the United States have worked to modernize their parking operations, there has been an influx of new technologies on the market. While many of these solutions can improve a parking program, managing all of these disconnected stand-alone technologies has created a significant burden for city personnel. ParkMobile 360 solves this problem by bringing everything together in one centralized platform. \"In the past, cities have had very inefficient processes for managing all the different parking technologies,\" says Jon Ziglar, CEO of ParkMobile. \"Now with ParkMobile 360, cities have one centralized platform to see all their parking data and set rates and policies.\" The ParkMobile 360 platform was officially launched in 2018. It has already been adopted nationwide to manage mobile payments via the ParkMobile app and 20 white label apps. Currently, over 500 municipalities and operators use ParkMobile 360 to manage rates and policies in real-time, and more than 1,000 clients use ParkMobile 360's reporting and analytics to track performance and gain deep insights into their operation. \"ParkMobile is excited to partner with Fresno, Clearwater, Orlando, and Chattanooga on this initiative,\" says Ziglar. \"With ParkMobile 360, our clients are able to bring multiple parking technologies together, through a single, intuitive, consolidated platform, making it much easier to manage.\" For more information or to get a full demo of the ParkMobile 360 platform, click here.

Additionally, ParkMobile offers parking reservations at stadium venues for concerts and sporting events. Reservations are also available in metro area garages, allowing people to drive into the city without having to worry about finding parking. ParkMobile has been named to the Inc. 5000, Deloitte Fast 500, Smart Cities Connect \"Smart 50,\" and the Atlanta Journal Constitution's Top Workplaces.

    "text": "SANTA BARBARA, Calif., Sept. 2, 2020 -- As Americans seek alternatives for safe living and travel in the COVID-19 pandemic, Living Vehicle is partnering with Volta Power Systems on lithium-ion storage for the 2021 Living Vehicle luxury travel trailer that allows users to live off-grid and recharge electric vehicles (EVs). The Living Vehicle offers up to 3080 watts of solar and 47,600 watt-hours of energy storage, the highest capacity lithium-ion system available in a luxury trailer. Living Vehicle owners can also charge their EVs at rates of up to 44 miles per charge-hour using optional 240-volt exportable power. \"To enjoy true off-grid living, access to reliable energy is a necessary and life-sustaining resource for safety, health and comfort,\" said Joanna Hofmann, co-founder and CMO of Living Vehicle. \"Our customers value the flexibility to avoid RV parks and stay anywhere with all the luxury comforts of shore power.\" Founded in 2017, Living Vehicle has seen customer demand meet their production run in the high-end trailer market for the last several years. More akin to a luxury apartment than an RV, the vehicle blends modern architecture with self-sufficient technology to enable a high-end, off-grid living experience. The luxury trailers leverage advanced energy storage, redundant generation and water conservation technology to preserve and extend utility resources for days or weeks while still supporting high-power amenities like air-conditioning, appliances and entertainment. Coupled with solar and optional liquid propane generation, Living Vehicle offers customers the opportunity to maximize their time off-grid. The announcement comes as Americans are finding creative ways to satiate their wanderlust during the COVID-19 pandemic. Would-be adventurers are showing preference for more self-sufficient domestic travel options like RVs, resulting in skyrocketed demand. Living Vehicle is positioning to meet these demands with even greater freedom and safety. \"With the continued disruption of COVID-19, advanced energy is helping us reimagine what's possible for adventure, safety, and everyday life,\" said Jack Johnson, founder and CEO of Volta Power Systems. \"More than any other trailer on the market, Living Vehicle uses the Volta system to its fullest capability, creating an off-grid experience never before possible.\" Living Vehicle is releasing three different models for 2021, each with increasing Volta system sizes accompanied by hefty solar power generation setups. The 2021 PRO model offers 47,600 watt-hours of energy storage with an industry-leading 3,080-watt solar array. For users with a companion EV or who are planning for an electric tow vehicle, Living Vehicle's 2021 models will also support exportable power for EV charging directly from the trailer. \"Many of our customers have down-payments on electric trucks like Tesla's Cybertruck or the Rivian, which require access to reliable charging for long-term off-grid use,\" said Matthew Hofmann, co-founder and lead designer. \"With the ability to export high-voltage power from the Volta system, Living Vehicle models will be able to quickly and sustainably charge these tow vehicles or companion cars using stored energy.\" The Volta system can charge from shore power, solar panels, an optional alternator (installed in a gasoline or diesel tow vehicle), or an optional Cummins generator. These layers of redundant power supply are critical for long-term health and safety in severe weather or natural disasters. The Living Vehicle 2021 luxury travel trailers are available for reservation this month, with deliveries slated for early 2021. About Living VehicleFounded in 2017, Living Vehicle blends modern architecture and technology to create the ultimate luxury travel trailer. Quality comes first in these high-end adaptable spaces that allow you to live, travel, work, and seek adventure off-grid in any environment.

Although most food banks are prepared for emergencies, the pandemic has caused a massive strain on the organizations providing food services that now even more Americans need access to. Social distancing and safety protocols have decreased the number of volunteers and forced both employees and volunteers of these organizations to work from home. Scaling operations quickly to meet increased demand in a remote setting can be very difficult and requires the right technology. Deltapath Mobile is the next generation mobility app by Deltapath serving your everyday business communication needs. Deltapath Mobile allows users to adapt to every situation anywhere and at any time while maintaining high fidelity and providing the audio quality of the future, today. Alameda County Community Food Bank, already a Deltapath client, onboarded new volunteers quickly through the Deltapath Mobile app. Staff and volunteers were able to download the app and scan a  QR code to instantly take calls from the ACCFB's helplines right from their own smartphones. \"Alameda County Community Food Bank saw its Emergency Food Helpline call volume jump by 1000% in the first ten days of the pandemic. Food insecurity has continued since then. In the past two weeks alone, the call volume spiked again by 220%. We are proud to partner with Deltapath Efforts and help ensure our Helpline remains operational using Deltapath Mobile while our operators stay safely sheltered in place. Connecting the community to food is just one piece, however. As we work to serve a surge in need they need as much community support as possible; if you can, please consider donating at https://donate.accfb.org\"  Amy Donovan, Chief Financial Officer, Alameda County Community Food Bank. David Liu, CEO and Founder of Deltapath stated, \"The ability to remain agile and be able to quickly scale your remote operations is increasingly important given the current state of affairs. Deltapath Mobile is helping businesses to take their operations remotely and do so quickly, all while being able to scale to increased demand. I am so happy that Food Banks and other community servicing organizations have been able to use our technology to help the community during this difficult time.\" Currently, Deltapath is contacting non-profits in the Bay Area about their communication technology to see if they can help companies better serve their community.

Investment institutions include NGC Ventures, SNZ Holding, Consensus Lab, Digital Renaissance, Youbi Capital, DFG, Longhash, etc. Bifrost said, \"Investors participating in this round of financing are not lack of early Polkadot investors and staking business-related institutions. It is expected that these institutional investors will be able to provide Bifrost with parachain slot auctions and staking liquidity business support in the future.\" The popularity of the DeFi market and expectations for the launch of the ETH 2.0 staking mechanism flood the crypto market in 2020. The rapid development of DeFi and Staking markets is driving the two mechanisms of DeFi and Staking to interact more and more in the blockchain landscape, and superposition has produced more and more composability. But the problem also followed. In the Polkadot ecosystem, there is also such a project that is positioned in the DeFi basic protocol and aims to solve the liquidity of PoS tokens, which has attracted market attention under this background. Due to the emergence of DeFi products including liquid mining, DeFi products may bring users a super high annualized rate of return, but whether the prosperity built on the ETH PoW consensus can continue under the ETH 2.0 or Polkadot PoS consensus is a problem. For users, when staking and DeFi lending can only choose one of them, which method is more profitable becomes the basis of choice. The PoS consensus network will compete with DeFi products from the underlying mechanism to compete for users. To solve the problem of DeFi and staking rewards competition, Bifrost allows users to obtain staking rewards and release liquidity at the same time to obtain and optimize the interests of more DeFi fields including DEX, liquidity mining, etc. Also, Bifrost can solve the two problems first is PoS network liquidity and security mutunlly exclusive. Another is Staking reward acquisition in cross-chain scenarios. Bifrost provides an intermediate layer between staking and the application layer, so that the staking and application layer originally built on the underlying protocol change from a parallel relationship to a top and bottom compatible relationship, thereby solving the problem of DeFi and Staking reward competition. The project designed a mechanism that allows users to swap PoS Tokens into Bifrost vTokens through the Bifrost Protocol at any time, and each PoS Token will correspond to a different vToken, such as vDOT that bridges Polkadot tokens. Bifrost said that the nature of vToken includes:"

The rising prevalence of diabetes worldwide is expected to fuel market growth. According to a report by the International Diabetic Federation, the number of diabetic cases is expected to increase by 25% from 463 million in 2019 to 578 million in 2030. Additionally, countries in South East Asia and the Middle East are expected to witness close to 74% and 96% increase, respectively, in the number of cases by 2045. Increasing cases of diabetes will complement the growth of the market in the coming years. One of the market drivers is the growing need for non-invasive methodologies. Growing awareness of self-care treatments pertaining to supporting footwear, along with technical advances such as gel padding and the launch of smart socks with fiber-optic sensors, is presenting new growth opportunities for the market.

The growth is attributed to an increase in recommendations by doctors and medical councilors of calf-length socks to diabetic neuropathy patients. These socks help to avoid infection in the feet and any potential damage to their circulatory and nervous systems caused by high blood sugar levels. North America accounted for the largest revenue share in 2019.

Growing cases of diabetes in this region are expected to fuel the market growth. Moreover, the presence of leading players in this region is driving the market.

Eversoft diabetic socks with FreshGuard technology treatment that can prevent odor and moisture and decrease the risk of infection by reducing the friction against the skin. Technological innovations are expected to bode well for the regional market. E-commerce is expected to emerge as the fastest-growing channel in the coming years.

    "text": "HOBOKEN, N.J., Sept. 2, 2020 -- Health Recovery Solutions (HRS), a national provider of Telehealth and Remote Patient Monitoring solutions (RPM), announced today the launch of its COVID-19 Recovery Care Plan. The COVID-19 Recovery Care Plan was developed to support providers who are offering Telehealth and RPM to their patients recovering from COVID-19 at home. The care plan will ensure that clinicians understand how to properly leverage telehealth and RPM in the recovery period, both for patients who were treated in the hospital and are recovering at home, and those who have confronted the virus entirely at home from the onset of symptoms. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread across much of the country, with many experts fearing a second wave later this year. At-risk populations are still advised to stay home and follow the CDC guidelines to reduce exposure. While new patients are getting infected, other patients are recovering from the virus and confronting myriad ongoing symptoms including mental health challenges, neurological issues, heart and lung damages, debility, pain, among others. The COVID-19 Recovery Care Plan will support clinicians in identifying symptoms and addressing mental health issues, ultimately helping to improve the overall physical function of their patients. The number of patients recovering at home is increasing daily. Those hospitalized and particularly those who required ventilator support are the most challenging to support in their recovery. The goal of the COVID-19 Recovery Care Plan is to guide clinicians in the specific care requirements of this growing population. The COVID-19 Recovery Care Plan, informed by a review of the most current literature from the Centers for Disease Control, the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and the British Medical Journal, addresses the specific needs of patients recovering at home. It includes recommended interventions by discipline, a virtual visit guide, the PHQ9 depression screening, symptom survey questions, patient video education from the American Academy of Emergency Physicians and suggested daily biometrics depending on the patients' prognosis and symptoms. \"It's important that our clients have not only the right technology but also the right clinical content to help guide the care for this challenging cohort of patients. The COVID-19 Recovery Care Plan is designed to give clinicians critical data and information to effectively manage their patients but equally to educate patients about their condition so they can be more active participants in their own care - a proven best practice strategy. HRS' mission is firmly rooted in the care of patients, and the release of the COVID-19 Recovery Care Plan supports that mission,\" said Patty Upham, VP of Clinical Services at HRS. In early March HRS released its COVID-19 Care Plan which consists of a COVID-19 screening tool, symptom surveys, custom education, and accompanying clinical best practices on symptom survey cadence and video visits. Providers across the nation have used, and are continuing to leverage the COVID-19 Care Plan to monitor patients at home who have contracted or are at risk for the virus, ensuring that patients are able to remain safe and decreasing the chance of community spread. \"At NVNA & Hospice we have incorporated the HRS COVID Care Plan on our entire telehealth census since its inception in March 2020. This allows for an effective, ongoing layer of patient monitoring for COVID-19 symptoms. The care plan also provides clear, simple and accurate guidance to both assure and educate patients about the virus and to help stop the spread. It is an effective reference and clinical teach-back tool,\" said Cheryl Nelson, Clinical Manager Telemedicine & Home Health at Norwell VNA. \"Our team is looking forward to the COVID-19 Recovery Care Plan for the same reasons. The ability to monitor and track trends associated with the physical and mental impact patients experience post-COVID will be critical for timely clinical intervention. The HRS data collected and shared will also serve to broaden our global understanding of the longer term impact of the virus.\" Health Recovery Solutions' client base includes more than 250 health systems and enterprise home health agencies across 46 states. The company is in close coordination with multiple clients, their clinical team, and their reimbursement team on telehealth best practices specific to the evolving Public Health Emergency. About Health Recovery SolutionsHealth Recovery Solutions (HRS) supplies leading health systems with the most advanced remote monitoring platform and technology-enabled management services focused on changing patient behavior to reduce readmissions and improve clinical outcomes. HRS' disease-specific telehealth solutions are customized with educational videos, care plans, and medication reminders while also integrated with Bluetooth peripherals to engage patients.

    "text": "HELSINKI, Sept. 2, 2020 -- Helsinki Design Week, the Finnish capital's renowned multidisciplinary festival, will this year run as a hybrid digital and physical format. Running from 3rd - 13th September its main exhibition programme being will be hosted from the newly renovated Helsinki Olympic Stadium, with a stream of digital events taking the design festival to a wider audience and those unable to attend in person. Now in its 16th year, the Helsinki Design Week will celebrate the theme Commitment Matters, raising questions regarding how we can achieve and improve on meaning and long-term value in design. Jan Vapaavuori, Mayor of Helsinki said: \"Design is and should be present in everything we do. Now more than ever we must ask ourselves how design can improve lives, create commitment to modern democratic values, promote sustainability and innovation in urbanization, and provide us the tools needed for championing in the post-COVID world. I believe in exposing people to these questions through design. Partnership with Helsinki Design Week helps us achieve that.\" In a partnership with Virtual Helsinki, the programme will include Helsinki Virtual Design Street, a street-long virtual exhibition, transforming the city's main shopping street Aleksanterinkatu with three installations from emerging Finnish designers. The project will transform the city into a colourful and immersive virtual design experience, featuring the work of product designer Hanna Anonen, graphic artist Matts Bjolin, and fashion designer Fanni Lyytikäinen. For the duration of the festival, local and international visitors to the virtual city will experience a transformed urban realm, finding themselves in flowing water or standing on grass, under Escher-inspired bridges, or looking up at the street's facades which have been coloured, and patterned with flowers and moving abstract shapes. Hanna Harris, Chief Design Officer at the City of Helsinki said:  \"Helsinki wants to be the city that pioneers digital innovation to create engaging solutions for the future of our cities. The collaboration between Helsinki Design Week and Virtual Helsinki shows the potential for this kind of technology to not only be a playful, alternative and sustainable way to experience our city, but also demonstrates the impact it can have on how places might be envisioned, designed and managed in the future.\" Helsinki Design Week will mark the launch of the newly renovated Helsinki Olympic Stadium. Designed by architects Yrjö Lindegren and Toivo Jäntti for the 1940 Olympics, the iconic stadium has undergone a four-year refurbishment by Finnish studio K2S. It will play host to the main exhibition; a series of installations on design, architecture and fashion, presenting unique one-off pieces to largescale set ups. Helsinki Design Week's Programme Director Anni Korkman said: \"As the largest design festival in the Nordic countries, the aim this year is to make Helsinki Design Week as safe and as accessible as possible for Helsinki's citizens and our international visitors. The newly reopened Olympic Stadium is a fitting location to host the main Helsinki Design Week exhibition and Children's Design Weekend, but we are also excited to expand our programme into a comprehensive digital - and for the first time - virtual format. We look forward to welcoming visitors from across the world to join the wider discussion on why Commitment Matters.\" The Climate College introduces leading speakers and viewpoints in the field of urban planning and an eco-friendly future in cities. Mayor of Helsinki, Jan Vapaavuori, will open the day, with Hanna Harris, Chief Design Officer at the City of Helsinki, hosting the session. Registration and information here: https://www.helsinkidesignweek.com/events/climatecollege/ The theme for this year's event is \"Committed to Excellent Services for Everyone\". The full-day conference will share inspiring stories about developing products and services based on data to enhance customer experience and business. You can expect thoughts and practical tips on how to utilize data in design from experts in the field. Information here: https://www.helsinkidesignweek.com/data-driven-design-day/ (VIP registration through ING Media.) Helsinki Design Week is the latest event to take place in Virtual Helsinki and follows the unprecedented success of the virtual May Day concert earlier in the year. The event saw over 700,000 people tune in live to a virtual gig with Finnish rap stars JVG, totalling over 1.4million views by the end of the weekend. Helsinki, which was crowned as the most innovative region in the EU by the European Commission in 2019 and awarded the European Capital of Smart Tourism in 2019, is at the forefront of technical innovation. With a democratic approach to data and knowledge sharing, the city operates much like a city-wide test bed. By facilitating public and private collaborations the city is demonstrating how policies like open data and digital twins can benefit citizens and visitors alike. The full design week programme can be accessed here: https://www.helsinkidesignweek.com/programme/ Helsinki Design Week has been organized annually every September since 2005. With a festival programme of hundreds of events every year, it is the largest design festival in the Nordic countries. Helsinki Design Week is produced by Luovi Productions Ltd. Fanni Lyytikäinen is a multidisciplinary creative mind with roots in the suburbs of Eastern Helsinki. With her studies and background in fashion she has a strong interest in how the arts interact with society and time, and that interest has also brought her to work with research within trends and consumer behaviour in London. As a strong counterbalance, her personal work is off-worldly free with expression and color, with flowing shapes and layers that seem to forget the reality surrounding us. Hanna Anonen is a product and spatial designer based in Helsinki. Known for her talent in combining colours with forms, Anonen presents a fresh perspective on Nordic design. Having gained international attention and several prizes, she finds inspiration in everyday and fun items, and she is a skilled designer of simple yet impressive works. Matts Bjolin is an art director and graphic designer based in Helsinki. His work span from physical to digital surfaces and concepts. Throughout his career, he has worked with a diverse set of clients ranging from international brands to local entrepreneurs for big and small projects. Matts enjoys surprising and contrasting juxtapositions both in his work and leisure, sharing his time between the city and the remote countryside. The city's digital twin - Virtual Helsinki - is the result of a long-term strategic view into how the city uses its data, and the culmination of a two year partnership with VR studio Zoan. The Virtual Helsinki initiative has recreated experiences of the city's most famous landmarks, including art museum Amos Rex, the home and studio of Finnish architect Alvar Aalto, and the iconic Senate Square in the centre of Helsinki, to provide an opportunity for the city be experienced without the dependence on carbon intensive travel. While VR and 360-degree videos are used as a marketing tool by many destinations, Virtual Helsinki goes a step further, allowing visitors to move about freely in the digital simulation of Helsinki to explore at their own pace and create their own experiences in past, present and future time. Helsinki has ambitious goals in the pioneering and promoting of sustainable tourism, aiming to become a carbon neutral city by 2035. In developing Virtual Helsinki, Helsinki recognises the unique role that cities play in creating solutions to enable changes in lifestyles to address the global climate crisis. Mobile Virtual Helsinki is designed to be accessible as possible; audiences can view the virtual artworks with a smartphone, tablet or computer - VR headsets are not required.

More than 400 Cub Scout Packs are participating and there has been an uptick in interested families visiting our local sign up page: www.joinsocalscouts.org \"Community service has always been part of our mission and we are amazed at the response from our volunteers and Scouts during the pandemic,\" said Andrew Sisolak, Director of Field Services. \"Scouts created 3D printed and sewed masks for hospitals, in addition to food drives for on Catalina and in L.A. County.\" Scouts were busy this summer earning thousands of merit badges and meeting friends from all over the country as the council quickly pivoted to virtual camps. \"We had to include Pacific time on our sessions as kids from coast to coast and even a military base in England participated in our online Merit Badge courses and summer camps,\" stated Marketing Director R.C. Peterson. Video conferencing and safer at home orders meant JPL scientists and Hollywood actors were able to drop in and give guest lectures and answer questions from Scouts studying Space Exploration and Movie Making.  \"What really set our programming apart was combining virtual instruction with kinetic learning projects allowing students to get outside and participate in traditional Scouting skills all in a socially distance and safe manner,\" said Peterson.

(\"Ponce de Leon\"), a longevity research company focused on reversal of epigenetic aging, today announced the publication of the first peer-reviewed study of a non-drug substance to demonstrate improvements in lifespan, as well as healthspan, in mammals. The multi-year, controlled study, conducted by the Buck Institute for Research on Aging in aged mice, found that calcium alpha-ketoglutarate (Ca-AKG), a stable form of alpha-ketoglutarate (AKG), \"promotes longer, healthier life associated with a decrease in levels of inflammatory cytokines. Strikingly, the reduction in frailty was more dramatic than the increase in lifespan,\" leading the scientists to \"propose that Ca-AKG compresses the period of morbidity.\"  The publication, titled \"Alpha-ketoglutarate, an endogenous metabolite, extends lifespan and compresses morbidity in aging mice,\" and authored by Azar Shamirzadi, Ph.D., et al., will appear in the September 1, 2020 issue of the scientific journal Cell Metabolism.(DOI: 10.1016/j.cmet 2020.08.044) \"We are very excited to have sponsored this seminal research at the Buck Institute for Research on Aging,\" said Tom Weldon, Founder and CEO of Ponce De Leon Health, Inc. \"This publication represents the first time in history that an ingredient has been shown to not only dramatically extend healthspan, but also to compress morbidity in mammals,\" he continued. \"If translated to humans, this could meaningfully reduce the period of time spent suffering from age-related conditions, increase the period of healthy living, and dramatically reduce the cost of providing healthcare to an aging population.\" Researchers tracked two groups of mice beginning at 18 months of age (analogous to middle age) through the remainder of their natural lifespan.  The animals in both the control group and the Ca-AKG treated test group were observed for 31 frailty markers and tested for a multitude of biomarkers of aging and inflammation. Researchers found that mice in the test group experienced a 12% increase in lifespan, and perhaps even more significantly, a 46% reduction in frailty, and 41% increase in healthspan. The lead researcher, Azar Asadi Shahmirzadi, Ph.D., Pharm.D., observed that \"what is important about the study is the fact that adding calcium alpha-ketoglutarate to the diet not only delayed aging, it also compressed morbidity. This study suggests that aging and associated comorbidities are not inevitable, and may likely be managed.\" \"The study allowed us to document healthspan changes that took place over time, including benefits in reduced frailty, reduced inflammation, and the increased physical activity in the calcium alpha-ketoglutarate group,\" observed one of the trial's senior researchers, Brian Kennedy, Ph.D.  \"Although the study was conducted on animals, humans share a number of major molecular aging pathways with mice and experience many of the same challenges to health associated with old age,\" he continued.  \"We are of the view that supplementation with calcium alpha-ketoglutarate may impact important elements of human aging and improve quality of life in the elderly population,\" said Dr. Kennedy, Director of the Center of Healthy Ageing of the National University of Singapore, and CSO of Ponce De Leon Health. This research led to the development of Ponce De Leon's first commercial product, Rejuvant® LifeTabs™, a dietary supplement containing a proprietary sustained-release active ingredient LifeAKG.®  The company also offers a non-invasive DNA methylation test from TruMe Labs, an independent laboratory, to establish a baseline and track changes to biological aging while taking Rejuvant. Ponce De Leon Health (www.PDLHealth.com) is a commercial-stage longevity company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of non-prescription consumer products to address the reversal of epigenetic aging. Their goal is to increase human healthspan, improve quality of life, and reduce the cost of providing late stage health care to customers.

    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 2, 2020 -- The global astaxanthin market size is expected to reach USD 3.4 billion by 2027, expanding at a CAGR of 16.2%, according to a new report by Grand View Research, Inc. Increasing awareness about nutrition for healthy lifestyle and growing preference for dietary supplements due to high hospitalization costs are factors fueling the demand for nutraceuticals and natural antioxidants, thus driving the market. Read 76 page research report with ToC on \"Astaxanthin Market Size, Share & Trends Analysis Report By Source, By Product (Dried Algae Meal, Oil, Softgel), By Application (Nutraceutical, Cosmetics, Aquaculture and Animal Feed), And Segment Forecasts, 2020 - 2027\" at: https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/global-astaxanthin-market The key concerns regarding the adverse effects of chemical-based cosmetics has driven focus on the use of natural cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. Also, nutraceuticals have found a major application in the field of dermatology. For instance, in April 2019, researches in Japan and China investigated the use of astaxanthin on skin aging using mouse model and found that it improved dysregulation of aging-related gene expression. Astaxanthin is widely used as a high value keto–carotenoid pigment for coloring of fishes like prawns, salmon, trout, and ornamental fishes, in order to increase their commercial value. Apart from coloring of aquatic animals, the carotenoid also improved the biological properties like improvements in survival, reproductive capacity, growth performance, stress tolerance, immune–related gene expression, and disease resistance. Major players are focusing on new product development and collaborative agreements to meet the increasing demand for the carotenoid in aquaculture. For instance, Heliae collaborated with Syndel Laboratories Ltd. for production of producing Nymega-an aquaculture feed ingredient-which was expected to be commercialized in 2017. Thus, increased adoption of the carotenoid in the aforementioned applications is anticipated to drive the market.

Unlike many business awards that focus on the overall companies' success, instead the spotlight is individuals who make them tick– namely senior executives such as CEOs, Managing Directors, Directors and senior-level management.  The  intention is to give worthy individuals the recognition they deserve, using their example to inspire others to achieve similar success. Modern technology provides a constant connection to new customer bases, facilitating communication all over the world, and entrepreneurship and innovation are both key to the marketplaces of tomorrow.  Daniel Kilger, the pioneer behind Start up SAFARI – Munich, and new health tech company  Smokeless - welcomes these emerging opportunities with open arms. In an interview with Business Worldwide Magazine, he spoke about his passion for technology, entrepreneurial spirit and what the CEO Awards mean to him . Daniel developed and launched his own social media platform at the tender age of fourteen. It was a huge success in his region, informing people of events in the local area and enabling them to communicate and exchange ideas about the different social activities available to them. Since then, he hasn't stopped working and coming up with new ideas, keeping networking at the heart of everything he does. Daniel believes that communication is an essential ingredient to achieving business success. Upon graduating, he established an international academic partnership, encouraging students from his Munich university to partner in networking collaboration with students from a partner university in the USA.  His passion for  building business ecosystems and providing assistance to the next generation of start-ups in Munich, led him to initiate the Munich based Startup SAFARI.  In under two years, it has become a prominent door opener for aspiring innovators and entrepreneurs, encouraging others to achieve their full potential. Daniel promotes equality, providing a safe and productive environment for everyone regardless of gender, age, race, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity or religion. He champions a harassment-free space designed to encourage entrepreneurship and foster long lasting bonds. He is also a big believer in cutting through red tape, working with companies and regulatory bodies to promote a more user friendly approach to start-ups. His latest venture is Smokeless -  a disruptive technology which aims to change the world for good by providing an easy way for people to stop smoking.  Every five seconds one person dies from smoking related illnesses, but despite the risks a huge 96% of smokers fail to quit. Smokeless has been developed with smart algorithms, providing tailor made programmes for each individual, rather than offering a 'one size fits all' approach. As Smokeless challenges the status quo, Daniel is placing himself as a pioneer within the realm of transforming health. He told BWM that the key to his success is determination and the strength to follow his own path. \"Create your own journey...don't try to fit into a mould created by society to meet generic goals. Each journey is different, designed to be travelled at its own pace. To all students graduating in this surreal time, don't be afraid to build your own path and follow your own instincts. This can be your time.\" he said.

    "url": "https://www.prnewswire.com//news-releases/global-led-lighting-industry-to-reach-262-8-billion-value-by-2030-ps-intelligence-301122706.html",
    "text": "NEW YORK, Sept. 2, 2020 -- Due to the advancements in technology, the cost of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) has come down, while their operational efficiency and life have increased. As a result, the global LED lighting market is on the path to reaching $262.8 billion by 2030, from merely $67.6 billion in 2019, at a monumental CAGR of 12.9% between 2020 and 2030. For instance, a 60-Watt (W) LED bulb, which could be bought for $50 in January 2011, was available for $10 in July 2018. This is propelling the demand for such products in commercial, residential, and industrial settings around the world. P&S Intelligence finds, the LED lighting market is currently witnessing the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. In several countries, a lockdown has been imposed and major commercial and industrial facilities have been forced to down their shutters. As a result, not only has the supply of lights and their various components been affected, but even the construction projects are temporarily stuck in a limbo, thereby leading to a considerably lower demand for LED lights, than the pre-COVID era. Get the sample copy of this report @ https://www.psmarketresearch.com/market-analysis/led-lighting-market/report-sample The indoor bifurcation, under segmentation by application, is expected to continue holding the larger share in the LED lighting market during the next decade. This is ascribed to the large number of residential buildings being constructed in India, the U.S., the U.A.E., and China. For instance, under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) initiative, initially launched in 2015, the Indian government, in 2018, approved the construction of 321,567 affordable houses. Additionally, in Asia-Pacific (APAC) and Europe, several programs have been launched for the creation of smart cities. Since energy efficiency is one of the primary ideas behind such infrastructure, the construction of smart cities would further drive the installation of LED lights in indoor settings. Browse detailed report with in-depth TOC on LED Lighting Market Research Report: By Product Type (Luminaire, Lamp), Installation Type (New, Retrofit), Application (Indoor, Outdoor) - Global Industry Analysis and Growth Forecast to 2030 @ https://www.psmarketresearch.com/market-analysis/led-lighting-market Till 2019, Asia-Pacific (APAC) contributed the highest revenue to the LED lighting market, and the situation is expected to be the same during the next 10 years. Due to the growing residential construction sector and increasing disposable income of the regional inhabitants, especially those living in India, China, and South Korea, the usage of LED lights in residential settings is rising. Similarly, the demand for such products is surging in the commercial and industrial sectors, owing to the booming population, high industrialization and urbanization rates, and rising focus on electricity conservation. Mergers and acquisitions have been the most numerous of all the strategic moves in the LED lighting market in recent years, as such strategies are allowing companies to augment their revenue by a considerable margin, at the same time, reducing the degree of competition and number of competitors. Make enquiry about this report @ https://www.psmarketresearch.com/send-enquiry?enquiry-url=led-lighting-market For instance, in July 2019, Signify N.V. announced that it intends to purchase a 51% stake in Zhejiang Klite Lighting Holdings Co. Ltd. The move to acquire the stake in this Chinese cost-efficient LED lamp and luminaire provider has helped Signify N.V. widen its connected lighting solution portfolio. The major factors stimulating the high power LED market growth include rising adoption of energy-efficient lighting solutions and increasing government support for the adoption of LED lights, globally. Globally, the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region is expected to account for a substantial share in the high power LED market during the forecast period. https://www.psmarketresearch.com/market-analysis/high-power-led-market The growing demand for energy-efficient lighting solutions and the rising focus on smart lighting systems are the key factors positively impacting the ambient lighting market growth. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused disruption in the supply chain of electric components, thus affecting original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) globally. https://www.psmarketresearch.com/market-analysis/ambient-lighting-market-report P&S Intelligence is a provider of market research and consulting services catering to the market information needs of burgeoning industries across the world.

    "text": "LONDON, Sept. 2, 2020 -- When the world went into lockdown, twelve children aged between nine and seventeen formed the Board of Directors (Youth) of hope3g.com (HOPE). They had a mission; launching a free-to-use, free-to-access digital education platform designed to make home learning possible as the COVID-19 crisis refuses to go away. This is the future of education. With a groundbreaking vision, these kids have found solutions to the real problems presented to working parents at their wits' end, tired teachers trying to transition online, and uninspired students stuck at home. To date, the HOPE kids have spent just £45 (on a pizza party!), have secured the donation of an office building in central London, recruited over two-thousand graduates from top universities worldwide, partnered with magic-circle legal firms and the world's largest investment banks and accountants, and worked tirelessly to build a platform that should have cost millions. The HOPE mission is a collaborative initiative driven by children, made possible by adults. Coronavirus isn't stopping these young pioneers, it's kick-starting their global effort to get the world learning. In a time of global chaos, the HOPE Platform is creating harmony between parents' working days and children's learning days, as the pandemic continues to disrupt our daily work and school lives. All mums and dads are master jugglers, but even the most organised parent can't always ensure their children are occupied while they need peace to finish work or take an important Zoom meeting. Structure and routine has taken a nosedive ever since the living room became both the office and the classroom. With uncertainty over a second wave, parents and kids are nervously anticipating the difficulties that will ensue. With a simple to use, purpose-designed drag-and-drop scheduling system, HOPE has created the solution, ensuring every parent's working day and child's home-school day is harmonised in a way that is tailor-made to family needs. With the likelihood of local lockdowns and school closures throughout the next year, teachers are bracing themselves for the difficulty of spending hours redesigning lessons to be taught online. The HOPE kids believe in a better way that sees teachers helping teachers, and expands their outreach to a truly global audience. By uploading videos that can be accessed by students from all over the world as well as their own students, our teachers can rely on one another to fill in the gaps left by the disruption. With several teacher-bodies already preparing content to go live from day one, the HOPE kids want teachers everywhere to be able to easily and confidently transition to virtual teaching. No sacrificing quality of education through rushed online lessons, and educators have a global support network creating shared content for anyone to incorporate into their syllabus. You're going to need a bigger teachers' lounge! The HOPE kids have approached all aspects of their platform with no limitations on imagination, including who their teachers could be! Of course, teachers will always be the backbone of a child's education, but that doesn't mean they're the only ones who can teach and inspire the world! The HOPE kids believe that everyone has something valuable to teach or a passion to share, and dream of a platform that gives everyone the opportunity to do so. Anyone and everyone is invited to the party that the HOPE kids are throwing, to teach your passion, profession, or area of expertise! HOPE has already connected with a number of leading professionals, celebrities, politicians, sports stars and other influential leaders to contribute to our platform. Extra-curricular activities just hit the big time! HOPE is offering a catalogue of content on our platform that goes beyond the usual curriculum and gives kids everywhere the opportunity to learn practical skills and pursue their passions with lessons from experts and public figures in all industries.

    "text": "LONDON, Sept. 2, 2020 -- Smith+Nephew (LSE:SN,NYSE:SNN), the global medical technology business, today announces the launch of its NOVOSTITCH PRO Meniscal Repair System in Europe after successfully receiving CE mark certification. The NOVOSTITCH PRO Meniscal Repair System expands meniscal repair options to around 600,0001 European patients annually where the only previous option was removal. Meniscal tears are one of the most common orthopaedic injuries,2 with 70% of patients expecting a repair,3 yet only 15% actually getting one. Instead, the majority may receive a partial removal or a full meniscectomy4,5,6 which has been shown to increase the risk of osteoarthritis in the knee by 53% compared to baseline.7 The NOVOSTITCH PRO Meniscal Repair System is designed to provide surgeons with a means to treat more meniscal tears with repair and close the gap on meniscectomy. The first clinical experiences in Europe, Middle East and Africa have been well received. Dr. Ramon Cugat from Hospital Quiron Barcelona commented, \"The NOVOSTITCH PRO Meniscal Repair System represents a versatile and essential tool allowing surgeons the ability to repair meniscal tears that other devices, up until now, couldn't.\" Further, Dr. Ricardo Cueller from Policlínica Gipuzkoa Hospital, (País Vasco) offered a similar report after his first case explaining,  \"The NOVOSTITCH PRO Meniscal Repair System provided great versatility and a new way for surgeons to treat meniscal tears. We are excited by the possibility of providing meniscal repair to more patients.\" The NOVOSTITCH PRO Meniscal Repair System enables surgeons to place stitches arthroscopically in tight joint compartments, utilizing a meniscus-to-meniscus circumferential compression stitch allowing repair of tears that may not have been repaired in the past.8 The system includes an ergonomic and intuitive handle design and well-defined visual cues for precise stitch placement and control. In the UK, early clinical experiences were also positive. Mr. David Hahn, The Park Hospital, Nottingham exclaimed \"The NOVOSTITCH PRO will allow me to address more meniscal tears than previously thought possible. I look forward to using this promising device at all my locations.\" \"We are delighted to be able to offer this ground-breaking technology to surgeons in Europe,\" commented Terry Byca, Vice President, Marketing Sports Medicine EMEA, Smith+Nephew. \"The NOVOSTITCH PRO Meniscal Repair System's unique capabilities, along with our industry leading All Tears, All Repairs Meniscal Repair portfolio brings us closer to making repair, not removal, the standard-of-care for meniscal tears.\" The NOVOSTITCH PRO Meniscal Repair System is commercially available for sale in the US, Europe, Middle East, Africa and select countries.

    "url": "https://www.prnewswire.com//news-releases/digiplex-achieves-nps-score-more-than-twice-as-high-as-nordic-data-center-benchmark-301122679.html",
    "text": "OSLO, Norway, Sept. 2, 2020 -- DigiPlex, the Nordic leader for sustainable, innovative, and secure data centres, is proud to report a Net Promoter Score (NPS) of plus 48 compared to an industry average of minus 35 across the Nordics, outshining the competition. As part of DigiPlex customer strategy, annual customer surveys are conducted and covers all DigiPlex Nordic markets to measure customer satisfaction. This year's survey was performed by Netigate and the internationally recognised NPS measure was added. NPS judges the likelihood that DigiPlex customers will purchase again or recommend DigiPlex services to another company. This year's DigiPlex customer survey, performed during the spring of 2020, delivered an NPS of plus 48, compared to NPS benchmark for the Nordic Data Center industry of minus 35. (Scoring ranging from -100 to +100.) Customers rated DigiPlex on key measures of satisfaction such as service quality, responsiveness, issue follow-up and resolution, proactivity, and the company's understanding of their businesses. Almost two-thirds (61%) of DigiPlex customer respondents identified as Promoters (scoring between 9-10 out of a maximum of 10), with the average percentage of Promoters just 19%. Over half (54%) of respondents from non-DigiPlex customers were not satisfied with their current data center provider. Commenting on the result, DigiPlex CEO, Wiljar Nesse, said; \"Meeting or exceeding customer's expectations is extremely important for a mutually valuable and long-term partnership. The high levels of satisfaction among our customers as confirmed by this survey are therefore very gratifying. With DigiPlex culture of constant improvement, we will continue sharpening our customer offering to increase customer satisfaction and loyalty even further.\" Christine Ønvik Nerhagen, Head of Professional Services Norway at Netigate added; \"Netigate conducts thousands of NPS projects every year and we found it very interesting to engage with DigiPlex to create this unique study of the Nordic data center market. Netigate collected data from both DigiPlex customers and a customized NPS benchmark consisting of data from 300 IT-decision makers in the Nordic countries. Upon extensive analysis we could identify a remarkable level of satisfaction among DigiPlex customers compared to the Nordic data center industry.\" DigiPlex was quick to react on the COVID-19 pandemic through regular communication with its customers on measures taken to reduce the risk of contamination within the business. It created a Corporate COVID-19 Response Team, segregated the workforce into dedicated teams per site, halted business travelling and attendance at external events, updated employee policies, increased safety protocols and restricted access across all DigiPlex data centers among other actions. DigiPlex used its customer satisfaction survey to gain feedback on how satisfied customers were with these actions and the way DigiPlex communicated around COVID-19. The response was very encouraging with a rating of 4.33 for the way the company handled COVID-19 and 4.36 for its communication of operational decisions. Both ratings were out of a possible maximum score of 5 and compared to Benchmarks of 4.15 and 3.79 respectively for other Nordic data center companies. \"Our customers have been extremely committed in working with us to mitigate any potential operational risks during this pandemic. Maintaining transparent and timely communication with clients is always important, especially in times of crisis and it is clear that they welcomed our rapid and comprehensive communication around our COVID-19 response,\" said Fredrik Jansson, Chief Strategy, Marketing and Communications Officer, DigiPlex. The customer survey was independently administered by Netigate and calculated overall customer satisfaction and loyalty. It was conducted on-line between May 25-June 15, 2020.The survey was built on customer satisfaction methodology structured around and measuring all stages of the DigiPlex customer journey. NPS was calculated in addition to specific measures used for internal best practice and customer service improvement.

    "text": "TOKYO, Sept. 2, 2020 -- The Global Innovation Challenge Executive Committee has launched \"Global Innovation Challenge 2021 -- Living Assistance Robot Award\" under the theme of ensuring living assistance for disabled people with the aim of achieving a society where people will not have to be conscious about disabilities. (Logo: https://kyodonewsprwire.jp/prwfile/release/M106211/202008313660/_prw_PI1fl_hHEiIH91.jpg) (Image: https://kyodonewsprwire.jp/prwfile/release/M106211/202008313660/_prw_PI2fl_KN0vA3d4.jpg) There are growing numbers of people in the world who need living assistance because of advanced age, illnesses and injuries they suffered in accidents, among other factors. While both assistance providers and recipients are required to shoulder certain mental, physical and financial burdens, investors are not necessarily enthusiastic about investing in the development of robots for health and welfare because the market for this field is relatively small. The improvement of public infrastructure and the promotion of barrier-free access now allow people with leg disabilities to lead their daily lives on their own to a greater extent if they have wheelchairs. Still, their activities are restricted in areas where such an environment has not been sufficiently developed. For example, if people with leg disabilities visit their friends' homes that have not been made barrier-free like their own homes, their activities will be restrained. They can travel by using wheelchairs, receiving assistance from others and using support equipment to walk, but many of them desire to stand and walk on their own. Regardless of whether sufficient public infrastructure is in place and barrier-free access is available, the organizer of the initiative believes that robots that help people walk on their own will allow those with leg disabilities to enjoy freer daily lives in their own ways to a greater extent. The Living Assistance Robot Award has been established to ensure that innovative robots which help people in wheelchair fully use their residual functions to walk on their own will be broadly in use all over the world. The award will support those engaged in research and development of such robots worldwide. \"Science and technology have been advancing constantly. Smartphones have realized many things that were previously regarded just as dreams. Our daily lives and business activities are moving at an increasingly rapid pace and we live in a world where we can try new things. However, once people become physically disabled because of accidents or illnesses, they find it difficult to lead ordinary lives. \"We have established this award because we believe that we can create a world where people won't have to be conscious about disabilities by applying evolving science and technology to the field of health and welfare and supporting engineers in this field. \"We would be glad if this award helps those engaged in research and development all over the world.\" This award is given to organizations developing robots that help people with leg disabilities walk on their own. Specifically, the committee will commend organizations that have developed robots allowing people with leg disabilities to walk on their own and support their motions in various aspects of daily lives. Moreover, prize money will be awarded to such organizations to support their research and development. Qualifications: Organizations developing robots that help people whose lower limbs are paralyzed to walk on their own. Criteria for selection: The organizer will set up seven assumed scenes of daily life and judge whether robots entered in the contest can allow physically disabled people to walk on their own in each scene.

    "text": "DUBAI, UAE, Sept. 2, 2020 -- Sungrow, the global leading inverter solution supplier for renewables, announced that the Company partnered with Shanghai Electric to supply its latest 1500V 6.25 MW turnkey solution to the 900 MW fifth phase of the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park in Dubai, illustrating its efforts in supporting Dubai Clean Energy Strategy 2050 and lowering the MENA region's carbon footprint. The 900 MW fifth phase of the park is expected to be online in Q2 2021 and will power 270,000 homes, offsetting 1.18 million tons of carbon emissions annually. Based on the Independent Power Producer (IPP) model, ACWA Power in partnership with Gulf Investment Corporation (GIC) won the bid with a tariff of USD 1.6953 cents/kWh, establishing a new global benchmark for solar energy. The low off-taking price requires a minimized LCOE, which poses tremendous challenges to inverter solutions. Sungrow's upgraded 1500V turnkey solution to be installed is an ideal match for this landmark project. The project is a vital part of the strategic agreement forged recently between Shanghai Electric and Sungrow. \"The solution offered by Sungrow fits our demand very well. The high-efficiency and cost-saving solution, proven delivery capability and prompt service have made them a preferred partner for our growing list of assets,\" commented Mr. Cao Min, President of Shanghai Electric. ACWA Power, as the lead developer of the project, has utilized Sungrow inverters in its recent projects including a 500 MW Ibri II project in Oman. \"We're proud to be a part of another fabulous project in the MENA region. This will pave the way for more opportunities and facilitate the local decarbonization at large. We strongly believe that innovation will never cease even during the COVID-19 pandemic,\" said James Wu, Vice President of Sungrow. With the local branch established in Dubai, Sungrow continues to make big moves with inverters installed in landmark plants. The latest 1H financial report shows a 55.57% year-on-year growth in revenue while the cumulative installations reaching 120 GW as of June 2020, indicating the Company's robust momentum.

Entitled “Reimaging Big Oil: The Age of Transformation,” the bank says a new European Commission rule kicking in by the end of next year can actually drive this shift.

Under what is called the EU taxonomy, Goldman analysts see five categories that are eligible to be labeled as sustainable in which Big Oils have a material or growing presence: low-carbon electricity; petrochemicals manufacturing; biofuels manufacturing; clean hydrogen and carbon sequestration. They estimate European big oil companies could increase their share of taxonomy-eligible revenue to 25% by 2030, from 7% now, and 50% of capital expenditure, from 10% today.

    "text": "European stocks rallied on Wednesday, boosted as the euro pulled back from a two-year high and on bullish optimism for equities on Wall Street. A pullback for the euro was attributed to comments by Philip Lane, chief economist at the European Central Bank, who said “the euro-dollar rate does matter.” “If there are forces moving the euro-dollar rate around, that feeds into our global and European forecasts and that in turn does feed into our monetary policy setting,” Lane reportedly said in an online conference on Tuesday evening, according to Bloomberg. “These comments constitute the first pushback against appreciation in this EURUSD cycle and does not come as a surprise. However, our central case remains that the ECB will stick to verbal intervention, rather than cut the deposit facility rate,” said Gizem Kara, economist at BNP Paribas in London, in a note to clients. The economist said “risk-reward of cutting is not favorable right now” and if the market perceives the ECB has used up its firepower, the currency could even rise. Data released on Tuesday showed eurozone consumer prices dropping in August for the first time in four years. Luxury goods makers and apparel companies joined the rally, with LVMH Moet Hennessey Louis Vuitton up 3.4%, Kering climbing nearly 5%, and Adidas up 4%. But Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, said the company had “been performing strongly prior to the pandemic, and there are some signs that a recovery is already in place following the full opening of its sites at the end of June. This has been the best month since the April bounce-back, as tech stocks have extended gains. Barbara Kollmeyer is an editor for MarketWatch in Madrid. Follow her on Twitter @bkollmeyer.

    "text": "Deal talks for TikTok’s U.S. operations have hit a snag over the key question of whether the app’s core algorithms can be included as part of a deal, according to people familiar with the matter. The algorithms, which determine the videos served to users and are seen as TikTok’s secret sauce, were considered part of the deal negotiations up until Friday, when the Chinese government issued new restrictions on the export of artificial-intelligence technology, according to people familiar with the matter. Now both sides are trying to figure out whether the order means the algorithms need Chinese government approval for transfer, and if so, whether Beijing would sign off. The complexity involved has reduced the chances that a deal could be completed any time soon. TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance Ltd., has said it will comply with the Chinese government order, and is trying to get clarity from Beijing on how to proceed with a sale if the new restrictions apply to its algorithms, some of the people said. For bidders, the idea of buying TikTok without the algorithms completely changes the outlook on what the companies are bidding for, other people familiar with the situation said. They believe a large portion of the value of TikTok is in the suggestion algorithms that keep users glued to the app. An expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.

    "text": "Google will pass on the cost of new European digital taxes to advertisers, incorporating these fees into its rates instead of paying them out of pocket. All three countries have instituted digital taxes within the last year, in an attempt to capture more of the revenues that technology giants generate within their borders. But investors worried that these digital taxes would hit Google’s bottom line will be relieved to hear that advertisers will bear the costs instead. Phil Smith, the director general of the ISBA, which represents British advertisers, said the move was “the inevitable outcome of the U.K.’s unilateral approach to digital taxation.” Starting November 1, a 2% fee will be added to invoices in the U.K., while customers in Austria and Turkey will have to pay a 5% fee on top of regular ad rates. These fees explicitly cover the cost of digital services taxes in the U.K. and Austria, and for Turkish customers represent “the complexity and cost of complying with regulations.” For now, Google won’t be extending fees covering digital taxes to all European countries that have imposed them, such as in France, which has committed to taxing tech giants this year regardless of whether an international tax standard for big tech is reached. Despite being relatively isolated from the economic impacts of the coronavirus pandemic, Google and Amazon have taken these fee decisions to protect their finances. Google’s revenues in the second quarter of 2020 remain only marginally lower than the year before, while Amazon’s share price is up over 48% year-to-date. Meanwhile, the advertising sector is in a rut, with marketing budgets being slashed across the board as companies cut costs to meet the economic challenges of the pandemic. “Digital service taxes and other regulations increase the cost of digital advertising. Typically, these kinds of cost increases are borne by customers,” a Google spokesperson said. “We’ll also continue to encourage governments globally to focus on international tax reform rather than implementing new, unilateral levies.” Opinion: Why the U.K. and France play against type in digital tax row with the U.S. President Donald Trump dove into the latest eruption in the nation’s reckoning over racial injustice on Tuesday, visiting the “destruction” left by rioters in Kenosha, Wisconsin, and declaring it was enabled by Democratic leaders.

    "text": "The 2020 election race between incumbent President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden is a coin toss,  LPL financial chief market strategist Ryan Detrick says. Indeed, a number of polls and betting odds indicate that a once-yawning lead enjoyed by Biden is starting to wane. Real Clear Politics shows that the Democratic nominee is leading Trump by 6.2 percentage points, based on an average of national polls, and his advantage in so-called battleground states, stands at a relatively razor-thin margin of 2.7 percentage points, according to a separate RCP poll average. But Detrick says that a simple equity-market chart has been the best predictor of U.S. presidential elections since 1984, proving 100% accurate—and is 87% accurate since 1928. The LPL analyst says that a chart of the S&P 500’s performance in the three-month period ahead of Election Day, which is Nov. 3 this year, has proven accurate over the past nearly four decades. Detrick writes that a positive return over that three-month period “may signal an increased likelihood that the incumbent party may win, while stock market losses during the same period have tended to predict an opposition party win.” To be sure, the strategist acknowledges that the market isn’t the economy and that millions of people are out of work due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, but notes that a look at what stocks may say about the outcome of election may be one thing for investor to consider as they prepare for an uncertain stretch of trade ahead of that key vote. “The unique circumstances around this year’s pandemic seem to add plausibility that this could be the first time in almost 100 years that this signal may be wrong—especially if the stock market and economy continue to recover between now and Election Day,” he wrote. All that said, Detrick said that Trump is still contending with an even bigger factor that could stymie his re-election chances beyond the stock-market gains: a recession. “History has shown that when a recession has occurred during the two years before the election, the incumbent president has tended to lose,” the analysts wrote. “ In fact, the economy incredibly has predicted the winner of every presidential election going back to President Calvin Coolidge,” he added. That statistic also offers its own inherent caveat since the recession that ensued in this pandemic is a global one and occurred a stunning and historic rate. But the president’s handling of the current pandemic and the ensuing public-health crisis may be the one thing that voters weigh against or in favor of Trump. MarketWatch columnist Mark Hulbert, in an article on Tuesday pointing out the fallibility of trying to spot correlations between stock performance and election outcomes, says that investors should “be on your guard…for those using the stock market to predict who will win the White House in November.” Notably, he says that the historical data can be contorted to say a number of things but also that the range period, including a three-month stretch before the election, is arbitrary and should raise a caution for observers. Major U.S. stock indexes closed higher Tuesday, near or above prior all-time records, as upbeat economic reports and dovish tones from the Fed helped feed the buying momentum on Wall Street.

    "text": "Foreign-exchange traders pushed the U.S. dollar to a new round of lows Tuesday before letting up, and currency watchers expect the greenback to remain under pressure on expectations the Federal Reserve will succeed in its attempt to drive inflation higher. There were no obvious catalysts for the initial Tuesday decline, but the dollar’s continued weakness comes after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell last week made clear that policy makers would tolerate above-target inflation as part of a new policy-making framework that abandons the central bank’s previous bias toward pre-emptively hiking interest rates when the labor market gets tight and signs of potential inflationary pressures build. “With Chair Powell cementing the negative real yield narrative for the dollar, there is little to suggest the current U.S. dollar bear trend is to stop, wrote analysts Francesco Pesole and Petr Krpata of ING, in a note. A resulting pickup in inflation expectations has dropped real yields — the yield on U.S. Treasurys minus expected inflation — to all-time lows. The real yield on the 10-year Treasury note on Tuesday stood near -1.08% after hitting an all-time low of -1.11% on Monday. The negative expected return makes the dollar less attractive to investors. The adoption of average inflation targeting and a tolerance for an inflation overshoot suggests interest-rate hikes “are a very distant proposition” and that U.S. real interest rates will remain low and may go even lower if the Fed succeeds in generating domestic inflationary pressure, they said. “None of these should strategically bode well for the dollar,” the analysts wrote, noting that high nominal and real rates were the key ingredients behind a stronger dollar in recent years. The dollar’s slide has been under way since spring, with the currency dropping back sharply after running to a more than three-year high in March as the pandemic-induced global economic collapse and accompanying financial market turmoil sparked a global scramble for dollars. As financial markets stabilized and central banks, particularly the Fed, stepped in to provide aggressive monetary stimulus alongside fiscal efforts by governments, the dollar has retreated. The Fed also moved to quench the global thirst for dollars by enhancing existing currency swap lines with major central banks and opening new ones. The dollar’s decline began to pick up steam in the summer, with the DXY falling 4% in July for its biggest one-month drop in nearly a decade. The dollar’s drop from its pandemic peak was already being attributed to falling U.S. real yields and expectations the global economy was poised to outperform the U.S. as the pandemic eventually runs its course. “The dollar cycle has turned because real yields have collapsed, in absolute and relative terms, and because the U.S. growth advantage relative to other major economies has been diminished,” said Kit Juckes, global macro strategist at Société Générale, in a Tuesday note. Related: Dollar could become a ‘crash risk’ if U.S. loses credibility, analyst warns Commodities are also seen benefiting from a weaker dollar, as it makes assets denominated in the unit cheaper to users of other currencies. Juckes argued, however, that last week’s Fed move was relatively “modest” after the policy makers in March proved their willingness to go far beyond what previous officials had done. Market participants, however, have embraced the policy changes without asking important questions, he said. Ahead of last week’s announcement, the Fed had already pledged to keep interest rates lower for far longer than previously anticipated, he noted. And, Juckes added, while the Fed’s willingness to allow inflation to move above its target for a time is a significant step, there’s little attention paid to the fact that the Fed has so far been unable to push inflation up to its 2% target any more than the Bank of Japan or the European Central Bank. “The currency has moved further than the shift in growth expectations so far would seem to justify,” he said, while bets on a falling dollar have pushed speculative positioning to an extreme, though “when that triggers a correction isn’t easily forecastable. ” Biden condemns rioting, Massachusetts votes in closely watched Democratic primaries, Trump official reportedly wants the U.S. to adopt “herd immunity,” and other news to start your day.

    "title": "Only 19% of Tesla analysts say buy the stock while investors remain ‘insatiable’",
    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/only-19-of-tesla-analysts-say-buy-the-stock-while-investors-remain-insatiable-2020-09-01?mod=home-page",
    "text": "There is an old Wall Street saying that investing isn’t about being right or wrong, it’s about making money. No one understands that better than an investor in Tesla Inc.’s stock. The financial fundamentals and the historical valuations of earnings suggest the market is wrong about the electric vehicle (EV) maker’s stock price, according to the overwhelming majority of Tesla analysts. But the stock keeps rising and Tesla investors keep making money. No one is making more money than Elon Musk, Tesla’s chief executive officer, largest shareholder and arguably its most important cheerleader, who just became the third-richest person in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak, who has been bearish on Tesla since Jan. 23 2019, when the stock closed at $57.52, put it this way in a note to clients: Spak raised his price target to $290 from $170, but his target was still 42% below Monday’s closing price. See related: His short position just got ‘obliterated,’ but this Tesla bear isn’t giving up. Also read: Tesla takes advantage of stock’s best month in 7 years with $5 billion offering. There are some fundamental reasons for investors being right to buy, as Tesla has been profitable for four straight quarters, while Wall Street was wrong to expect losses in three of the past four quarters. And despite concerns about the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, Tesla delivered way more EVs than expected during the second quarter. While the 5-for-1 stock split Tesla announced on Aug. 11 didn’t improve the company’s fundamentals in any way, investors were right to buy or hold on to their shares, for now, as the price has charged up more than 80% since the announcement through Monday. Read more: Tesla stock rally accelerates further into record territory after split takes effect. Despite such strong investor conviction, 81% of analysts don’t recommend buying. Of the 36 analysts surveyed by FactSet, only seven, or 19%, have the equivalent of buy ratings on Tesla’s stock. And only one of those analysts, Jefferies’s Philippe Houchois, had a price target — $500 — that was above Monday’s closing price. Meanwhile, half the analysts had the equivalent of hold ratings and 11 analysts, or 31%, had the equivalent of sell ratings. The average price target of all the analysts was $261.85, according to FactSet, which implied a 47% drop from Monday’s closing price. Most of what analysts have been wrong about Tesla has taken place over roughly the past five months. At the end of March, when the COVID-19 crisis was full blown, there were the same number of bearish analysts as there are now and the average stock price target was $101.86, just 2.8% below the March 31 closing price of $104.80. With the stock’s gain since then, Tesla’s market capitalization increased to $464.3 billion as of Monday’s close, which was the seventh highest among U.S. companies. RBC’s Spak suggested that what may also keep supporting the stock is that given the sheer market valuation of Tesla, many portfolio managers have to add to positions “just to keep pace.” He also believes investors have been willing to show more patience and look further into the future to value the stock. “We still view Tesla as fundamentally overvalued and having to grow into its valuation,” Spak wrote. Spak recognizes that Tesla is clearly ahead of its competition, has relatively inexpensive access to capital, the ability to attract talent, an “incredible” brand, and understands that “narrative, momentum and other factors” can impact the stock price. But he still believes that ultimately, a company’s value is related to fundamental factors. Basically, he’s suggesting that one of the biggest risk factors to Tesla’s stock isn’t good or bad fundamental news, but how investors value that news. The next major potential news catalyst is Tesla’s “battery day” scheduled for Sept. 22, of which Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said recently he’s expecting a number of potential “game changing” developments. One of those developments is the “million mile” battery, which in theory will support an EV for 1 million miles, which could put Tesla miles ahead of its traditional gasoline-powered automotive competitors. That said, Ives is one of the analysts that doesn’t recommend buying — he’s at hold — while his price target of $380 suggests the stock could fall 24%. For those looking for actual fundamental risks, the following are just some of those included in the more than 20 pages of “risk factors” Tesla lists in its latest quarterly report filed on July 28. So far, those risks haven't mattered to Tesla investors. • “We are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer.” • “We have been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by the global COVID-19 pandemic, the duration and economic, governmental and social impact of which is difficult to predict, which may significantly harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.” • “We have experienced in the past, and may experience in the future, delays or other complications in the design, manufacture, launch, and production ramp of our vehicles, energy products, and product features, or may not realize our manufacturing cost targets, which could harm our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.” • “Our future growth and success is dependent upon consumers’ willingness to adopt electric vehicles and specifically our vehicles. We operate in the automotive industry, which is generally susceptible to cyclicality and volatility.” • “Any issues or delays in meeting our projected timelines, costs and production at or funding the ramp of Gigafactory Shanghai, or any difficulties in generating and maintaining local demand for vehicles manufactured there, could adversely impact our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition.” • “If our vehicles or other products that we sell or install fail to perform as expected, our ability to develop, market and sell our products and services could be harmed.” • “The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and we may not be successful in competing in these industries. We currently face competition from new and established domestic and international competitors and expect to face competition from others in the future, including competition from companies with new technology.” A bearish analyst on Tesla Inc.  is now a little less bearish, saying the electric vehicle maker has become one of the most important stocks in the U.S. stock market, but said the stock remains fundamentally overvalued. The stock surged 6.8% in premarket trading Tuesday, after soaring 12.6% on Monday. RBC Capital's Joseph Spak lifted is price target to $290, which implies a 42% drop from Monday's record close of $498.32, from $170, while maintaining the underperform rating he's had on the stock since January 2019. \"We recognize we underestimated a critical valuation point: seemingly insatiable investor demand for alternative/clean vehicles,\" Spak wrote in a note to clients. He said he also believes investors have willing to show more patience and look further out for companies like Tesla. \"That being said, we struggle to explain the run-up to the stock split which academically doesn't change the value of Tesla equity but could help fuel investor interest,\" Spak wrote. \"We still view Tesla as fundamentally overvalued and having to grow into its valuation.\" Of the 36 analysts surveyed by FactSet, just 19% are bullish, 31% are bearish, and 50% are neutral. Since Tesla announced the 5-for-1 stock split after the Aug. 11 close, the stock has soared 81.3% through Monday, while the S&P 500  has gained 5.0%.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-what-to-know-about-abbotts-15-minute-covid-19-test-11598982464?mod=home-page",
    "text": "On Aug. 26, the Food and Drug Administration granted an Emergency Use Authorization to a new rapid antigen test for COVID-19 called the BinaxNOW test. I study public health policy to combat infectious disease epidemics. Testing is one of the most powerful tools available to fight the spread of COVID-19. The new test is inexpensive, rapid and easy to use. It will massively scale up access to testing, but hurdles remain in achieving widespread, frequent COVID-19 testing. The credit-card-sized test is an antigen test that detects a specific viral protein from SARS-CoV-2. It costs $5 and doesn’t require a lab or a machine for processing. Performing the test is simple. A health-care worker or technician would use a swab to collect a sample from less than 1 inch inside the nostril. They would then combine the sample with a few drops of chemicals inside the test card. Within 15 minutes, the test strip would show a positive or negative result. The test is also paired with an app that produces a digital code that can be scanned to show proof of a recent negative COVID-19 test. The BinaxNOW test is currently only authorized for patients who have had COVID-19 symptoms for seven days or less, which is when virus levels in the body are likely to be high. It must be prescribed by a physician and performed by a trained technicianor other health-care worker. The PCR test for COVID-19 is currently widely used and considered the gold standard, but requires patient samples to be sent to a lab and can take days to provide results. The new antigen test is designed to be a cheap and quick alternative to PCR testing for diagnostic purposes in a medical setting. It would add critical capacity to an overstretched testing system. The emergency use authorization provides preliminary authorization for doctors to prescribe the antigen test while the full FDA approval process is ongoing. The authorization could be revoked if the test is not as accurate or reliable as expected. However, the true accuracy could be lower because the performance testing group was only 102 people and the accuracy hasn’t been validated by the FDA as part of the full approval process. There will inevitably be some false negatives and false positives with the BinaxNOW test since accuracy isn’t 100%, but the FDA will monitor the data to make sure the test meets the reported accuracy. The BinaxNOW test is cheap, rapid, able to be mass-produced and easy to use outside a lab. This makes it a promising candidate for widespread screening. However, the test is currently only authorized for people with COVID-19 symptoms. This is an obstacle because an estimated 40% of all COVID-19 cases are asymptomatic and these people likely don’t know that they’re contagious. To maximize the effectiveness of any COVID-19 screening program, it is important to test people whether they have symptoms or not. Health-care providers are able to prescribe the BinaxNOW test for asymptomatic patients for off-label use, but health officials don’t yet know how accurate the test is when performed on asymptomatic people. The massive expansion of testing access made possible by the BinaxNOW test will almost surely outweigh the downsides of a small number of inaccurate results. Abbott plans to manufacture 50 million tests per month starting in October. This will quickly exceed the 76 million COVID-19 tests the U.S. has performed over the last six months. Widespread, frequent testing is effective at slowing the spread of the coronavirus. The new testing capacity made possible by the authorization of this rapid antigen test represents a major advance in bringing the pandemic under control.

This was first published by The Conversation — “Will the new 15-minute COVID-19 test solve US testing problems?“ Shares of DocuSign Inc.  are up more than 16% in Tuesday morning trading after Zoom Video Communications Inc.  reported July-quarter results showing that it made more than four times as much revenue as it did a year ago. Zoom's earnings, which topped expectations, suggested that technologies enabling remote business functions are still seeing explosive growth due to the pandemic. DocuSign, which enables electronic signatures on legal documents, is due to report its own results after Thursday's closing bell. Shares of workplace-messaging company Slack Inc.  is also seeing its stock rise more than 3% in Tuesday's session.

    "text": "Even in the heart of a COVID-19 pandemic…make that especially in the heart of a COVID-19 pandemic, the summer road trip is a traditional taste of freedom that’s been celebrated since the automobile was invented. Inviting your dog to join you on these highway adventures makes you a much better person (just ask your pup). Keep in mind, however, that it’s going to take a little bit of planning. Nothing major, just some smart forethought and consideration for your 4-legged traveling companion. If you’re reading this story on your phone as your road-trip vehicle idles in the driveway, your dog in the seat next to you and you’re waiting for the Sherpas to finish packing the car, stop. You’ll still have a great road trip, but you should have started thinking through this journey with the dog a few weeks earlier. That’s when you would have gathered your pooch’s essential traveling tools like vaccination records, medicines, and a current dog tag with your mobile number on it. Of course, your dog has an ID microchip implanted because you love him/her, right? OK, be sure that the chip number is loaded into your smartphone. A pre-trip trip to the vet isn’t a bad idea either just to make sure everything is in order. And vet runs are always good practice for how well a dog travels. Another important pre-road trip consideration is which vehicle to take. If you’re a one-car family, of course, that’s academic. But if you have a choice, choose the SUV that has AC vents in back (your dog will worship you if you can get cooling air to the rear seats where most road trip dogs travel). Summer heat is unforgiving, especially to canines. Although SUVs work best for road trips with dogs — lots of extra gear comes along — cars will work just fine, too, and you won’t get any complaints out of Muttley either way. The important thing is to try to keep the second row — aka, the back seat — clear of luggage and gear so that your dog can take ownership of the space and feel secure in it. Leather seating cleans easier, but if you’re a big-dog owner, make sure you protect the rear seat from scratching nails with a pet hammock seat cover designed to keep your dog safe and protect the seat from natural pet behavior. It’ll also make cleaning up after the trip — dogs are dogs and they never learn to clean up their rooms, after all — infinitely easier. Other essentials to prep before you go are a no-spill water dish, treats (of course), toys (of course, of course), and a few items from home that carry your scent to comfort him, like a favorite blanket or even your pup’s bed. Don’t forget to pack food (pack about 15%t extra for travel) and food bowls. If you plan on camping or hiking, a first aid kit designed specifically for dogs is a good addition to your list. All you have to do now is get your dog’s Instagram account set up and you’re ready to travel. 1. I’m thirsty. 2. I have to pee. These sweetly ironic rules should come as no surprise. Water helps dogs function, flush toxins, regulate body temperature, and keep noses wet for optimal sniffin’. And it keeps them peeing throughout the day. When you’re on the road with a canine companion, always keep those two facts in mind as priorities. Pee stops are a good chance to get a little exercise, too, for both the dog and the driver. Speaking of exercise, no matter where you are on the journey, don’t hesitate to ask your smartphone for the location of the nearest dog park (every city and town has at least one) or if you’re doing a coastal trip, a dog beach. Both of these places are great shared communities where the natural practice is to stay at least 6 feet apart without seeming unfriendly. That’s true all across America, from the Union Square Dog Run in Manhattan to the Cayucos Dog Beach along California’s Highway 1. Plus, a worked out, sleeping dog travels best. Camping with dogs is a special kind of blast. These days, however, motels (and many hotels) seem to be getting more dog-friendly than ever. It’s easy to find a place where your tail-wagger can bunk with you free or for a very small fee. Many restaurants, too, especially now that coronavirus has forced so many dining establishments to expand their outdoor seating, are happy to accommodate with a big smile, a full menu and a fresh bowl of water for Fido. A road trip seen through eyes of a dog keeps car travel fresh. It may not always be super simple, but it is always rewarding and guaranteed to bring you and your companions, human and nonhuman, closer together. Treat every meal, motel stay and pee stop as a teaching and learning moment — a chance to refine your pup’s already stellar behavior. So relax and go have fun. If you and your dog have found a rhythm together at home, you’ll absolutely find one on the road. This story originally ran on Autotrader.com.

    "text": "At the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, close to eight of 10 MBA students say they are not excited about the coming fall semester because the coronavirus pandemic has forced classes online. At UCLA’s Anderson School of Management, newly admitted international students are outraged that they cannot defer their admission to the school’s MBA program even if they cannot get a student visa to come to the U.S. At New York University’s Stern School of Business, students are demanding the reversal of a 3.5% increase in MBA tuition during COVID-19 and asking for a 5% to 10% discount on the price of their degrees because of the shift to virtual classes. Add to all of the anxiety and frustration the fact that some graduates from the most prestigious business schools, including Harvard and Stanford universities, saw their summer internships and full-time job offers clawed back by companies due to the COVID recession. Many more are deeply worried about their prospects for landing a job over the next year as still more companies freeze budgets and hiring plans. So is this a time to apply to an MBA program and go even further into debt? You better believe it is, and here’s why. A recession and a health crisis, no matter how severe, will not last forever. But while it lasts, many will find their opportunities to advance at work diminished or completely curtailed. Many more have already found themselves on unemployment. By the time this year’s incoming MBA students graduate in 2023, it is almost a certainty that both COVID-19 and the economic downturn will be in the rearview mirror. The Class of 2023 will inevitably graduate into a fully recovered economy, better prepared to take full advantage of the upturn. No less crucial, they will have been the beneficiaries of not merely the business basics or of the leadership development a strong MBA program provides; they will be steeped in both data analytics, specifically how to smartly harness massive datasets for decision making, and how to leverage new technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, to gain important efficiencies in a business moving forward. Of all the graduate degrees you could earn, an MBA from a highly selective business school is pretty much a no-brainer investment. The top five schools for average starting pay last year — base salary plus signing bonus — are all big names, led by the Wharton School at $172,016, NYU Stern ($168,291), Stanford ($168,226), Dartmouth College’s Tuck School of Business ($166,251), and the University of Virginia’s Darden School of Business ($165,292). In all, 12 schools in the top 25 of U.S. News’s MBA ranking report starting salaries above $160,000, and 17 above $150,000. “If you stayed at work in 2021, your career options and earning potential in 2023 would be more limited if you had gone to business school,” noted Soojin Kwon, managing director of full-time MBA admissions and program at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business. Why? Kwon notes that students will gain three advantages by going back to school that they won’t get by staying in a job during the pandemic. “One, you’ll meet with and learn from hundreds of smart, ambitious and interesting people you wouldn’t have met if you didn’t go to business school,” Kwon said at a recent panel discussion for Poets & Quants.  “Two, you’re going to learn how to network and interview for jobs in an industry or function that you’re interested in going into, and most, if not all MBA recruiters this year are planning to do virtual recruiting. So you’re going to learn how to interview in the format in which recruiters are going to be recruiting. In addition, she said, “You’re going to gain access to a network of tens of thousands of business school alumni and hundreds of thousands of alumni in the broader university community. You could absolutely find another job through LinkedIn, but it’s no secret that you’re more likely to get a response if you have some kind of connection, and an MBA from a top school with the support of alumni provides that invaluable connection for life.” During the Great Recession of 2008-2009, the job situation was just as miserable and prospects for many MBAs appeared so dim that some openly questioned their decision to borrow money to get the degree. Robert Bruner, then dean of the University of Virginia’s Darden School of Business, found himself having to defend the value of the MBA. He rose to the challenge, and his points then made much sense now. Education adds significant value to human potential. “Generally, research finds real rates of return on investment upwards of 10% and as high as 50%. And there is a correlation between years in school and earning power but that’s only the quantitative part. Every year, students graduate who are more self-confident, better communicators, and more promising leaders than when they enrolled. And they have joined an alumni network that has helped in good times and bad.” Indeed, long-term thinking beats short-term thinking all the time. Young professionals have a long career ahead of them. “With the benefits of modern medicine, you can probably look forward to a career of 50 years,” Bruner wrote. “Are you judging the worth of an MBA by only the first job you get out of B-school? Take the long view. If you could discount the marginal benefits of an MBA from a competitive school over the next 50 years, I’d guess that they well exceed the costs. Don’t discount the future too steeply.” Truth is, you can bet with certainty that tough times will again appear once this pandemic is under control and the economy recovers. The ability to assess and bear sensible risks is the core of business and entrepreneurship. Pursuing a graduate degree in business to learn valuable skills, cultivate one’s leadership potential, and acquire a supportive network of connected professionals is a risk worth taking. John A.

    "text": "House prices in the U.K. surged to an all-time high in August, fueled by pent-up demand and record low mortgage rates, according to new figures from Nationwide. Britain’s biggest building society said prices jumped by 2% in August, following a 1.8% rise in July, marking the highest monthly increase since February 2004. Annual house price growth jumped to 3.7% last month from 1.5% in July. The average price was £224,123 ($298,864) in August, up from just under £170,000 10 years ago, Nationwide said. Robert Gardner, Nationwide’s chief economist, said the bounce back in prices reflects the unexpectedly rapid recovery in housing market activity since the easing of lockdown restrictions. “This rebound reflects a number of factors. Pent-up demand is coming through, where decisions taken to move before lockdown are progressing. Behavioral shifts may also be boosting activity, as people reassess their housing needs and preferences as a result of life in lockdown,” he said. The housing market was hit hard in March at the height of the lockdown, as estate agents were forced to close their offices and viewings weren’t allowed. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the next few months are crucial for Barratt because, while the group demonstrated its strength during the lockdown, an extended recession would prove an even tougher test. “The taxpayer funded furlough scheme, mortgage holidays and a ban on evictions are all due to be unwound in the autumn, which all could have major implications on demand for housing going forward,” she said. Read:U.K. jobs picture looks bleak with 7.5 million furloughed or away from their job Shares in Barratt rose 6.91% in early morning London trading. Gardner said that the trends look set to continue in the near term, further boosted by Chancellor Rishi Sunak’s recently announced stamp duty holiday — the transfer tax paid when buying a home. However, Gardner cautioned that most forecasters expect labor market conditions to weaken significantly in the quarters ahead, as a result of the after effects of the pandemic and as government support schemes wind down. “If this comes to pass, it would likely dampen housing activity once again in the quarters ahead,” Gardner said.

    "text": "Bill Ackman has an idea for saving the system that made him a billionaire. The Pershing Square Capital Management chairman told investors in a recent note that, in order to preserve capitalism, steps need to be taken to close the increasing inequality gap. One possible measure: investment accounts for every child. Under Ackman’s plan, each child born in the U.S. would receive $6,750 in a government-funded basket of index funds that could only be tapped at retirement. Assuming 8% returns over 65 years from birth to retirement, that total would ultimately exceed $1 million, and it would cost the government about $26 billion a year, if the birthrate holds. “Compounded returns over time are indeed one of the great wonders of the world, and every day we wait to address this issue, the problem looms larger,” the hedge-fund manager wrote. He added that a government-led push for equities-investing accounts could “encourage greater financial literacy” and spread the stock-market’s gains across a wider swath of the U.S. population. “Americans that have no ownership in the success of capitalism, and who are suffering economically, are more motivated to turn toward socialism or other alternatives,” he said in the note. Meanwhile, Ackman’s strong showing this year continues, thanks in large part to a well-timed bearish bet on corporate bonds in early 2020. That investment yielded a profit of more than $2 billion during the March coronavirus meltdown in the stock market. Shawn Langlois is an editor and writer for MarketWatch in Los Angeles.

    "text": "So much for playing videogames to escape reality — the 2020 U.S. presidential election has now even infiltrated “Animal Crossing.” Yes, the millions of people playing “Animal Crossing: New Horizons” since it was released for the Nintendo Switch in March, in which players build their own virtual islands populated by cute critters, can now add Joe Biden campaign signs to their digital front yards. Biden’s presidential campaign revealed its “Animal Crossing” partnership on Tuesday. “Show your Biden/Harris pride virtually!” it declared on its official campaign store, along with QR codes for players to scan and add the free political insignia all over their islands. The designs include the official Biden-Harris logo, a Team Joe logo, a “Joe” Pride logo, as well as a print of three aviator sunglasses in red, white and blue. “’Animal Crossing’ is a dynamic, diverse, and powerful platform that brings communities together from across the world,” Christian Tom, director of digital partnerships for the Biden campaign, said in a statement. “It is an exciting new opportunity for our campaign to engage and connect Biden-Harris supporters as they build and decorate their islands.” And the virtual campaign signs fit into the Biden camp’s pandemic playbook of hosting more online events, live-streamed fundraisers and speeches, while Trump has continued to campaign in person. Reps from Nintendo did not immediately respond to a MarketWatch query about whether the Biden campaign had to pay for those virtual signs to be available in the “Animal Crossing” game. Trump’s reelection campaign has not officially created campaign signs or T-shirts for “Animal Crossing,” although players can make their own — and in fact, have already done so. There are Trump and MAGA insignia on many individuals’ islands. CNN noted that, so far, there actually appear to be a few dozen more “MAGA” and “Trump” designs created by “Animal Crossing” gamers than Biden designs. Trump campaign deputy national press secretary Samantha Zager mocked Biden’s videogame gambit on Tuesday. “This explains everything: Joe Biden thinks he’s campaigning for president of ‘Animal Crossing’ from his basement,” she told CNN. “The Trump campaign will continue to spend its resources campaigning in the real world with real Americans.” Many people on social media also groaned at the Biden campaign’s “Animal Crossing” signs, as well, recalling Hillary Clinton calling on voters to “Pokemon Go to the polls” while she was running against Trump in 2016, citing another Nintendo gaming title. This isn’t the first time that political movements have made a mark in “Animal Crossing,” however. Players have also added Black Lives Matter flags and T-shirts to the game. President Donald Trump dove into the latest eruption in the nation’s reckoning over racial injustice on Tuesday, visiting the “destruction” left by rioters in Kenosha, Wisconsin, and declaring it was enabled by Democratic leaders.

    "text": "Nvidia Corp.’s stock closed at a record Tuesday as the chip company launched its new line of gaming cards and detailed more videogames that are taking advantage of the ray-tracing technology that was introduced in the previous line of graphics-processing units. Huang announced the new chips in a YouTube video Tuesday morning, similar to his announcement of new Ampere-based server chips in May. The new cards build upon Turing architecture, which brought real-time ray tracing — the rendering of realistic-looking lighting and shading — to the fore. But when RTX ray tracing made its appearance two years ago, critics argued that developers were slow in putting out enough games that took advantage of the technology. Nvidia said the RTX 3080 will be available Sept. 17, with the RTX 3090 available Sept. 24, and the RTX 3070 “sometime” in October. That will give the company about six weeks of sales of the new cards before Nvidia’s fiscal third quarter finishes up at the end of October. Nvidia said the $499 RTX 3070 runs faster than its $1,199 RTX 2080 Ti, which is currently listed as out of stock, and up to 60% faster than its original RTX 2070, which was $499 when Nvidia launched its 20-series of Turing-architecture gaming cards two years ago. The upgrade to the RTX 2070, or the “Super” version that came out in July 2019, last listed at $499. Similarly, the mid-tier $699 RTX 3080 is up to two times faster than the RTX 2080, Nvidia said. The “Super” version of the 2080 card last listed at $699. At the high end, however, Nvidia appears to be offering a deep discount on improved performance. The company said its $1,499 RTX 3090 runs up to 50% faster and 10 times quieter than its flagship Titan RTX, which last listed at $2,499. Huang said demand for the limited-run Titan “surprised us” as filmmakers were using the Titan to make 4K movies, bloggers used it to build broadcast workstations, and others used the card for applications that required its power. “There is clearly a need for a giant GPU that is available all over the world, so we made a giant Ampere,” Huang said in his presentation. Nvidia would not comment on whether it would lower prices on its 20-series Turing cards. As of market close on Tuesday, the company had yet to change 20-series card pricing on its website, and was still offering its RTX 2060 Super card at $399. Less than two weeks ago, Nvidia execs talked a lot about gaming on the company’s earnings conference call even though data-center sales had surpassed gaming for the first time ever, with Huang forecasting “this may very well be one of the best gaming seasons ever.” It was another wild day for Kodak stock.

    "text": "The German Bundestag decided on Tuesday to launch a full inquiry into the downfall of payment company Wirecard, which filed for insolvency in June after €1.9 billion in cash were found to be missing from its accounts. Lawmakers want to probe possible government failures to uncover the scandal even as evidence accumulated over the last year. - Wirecard’s former chief executive Markus Braun is in custody on accusations of running a criminal enterprise that defrauded creditors of €3.2 billion. Braun and other Wirecard executives deny any wrongdoing. The company’s former chief operating officer, Jan Marsalek, has fled Germany and his whereabouts is unknown. - Both finance minister Olaf Scholz and Germany’s top financial regulator, BaFin, have been accused of turning a blind eye to Wirecard’s problems, first reported by the Financial Times in January, 2019, because the company was seen as a German fintech success story. BaFin even originally filed criminal complaints against the journalists who first uncovered the fraud. - “A picture has emerged that those fraudsters had it pretty easy,” said Florian Toncar, an opposition MP from the centrist Free Democratic Party. Lawmakers notably want to establish why Chancellor Angela Merkel lobbied for Wirecard during a trip to China in September, 2019, even as allegations of dubious accounting had already surfaced. The outlook: The inquiry could prove embarrassing for the two ruling coalition parties, Merkel’s conservative CDU and Scholz’s social-democratic SPD, one year before the general election scheduled in the fall of 2021. But the impact on the political careers of both parties’ leaders won’t be the same: Merkel is retiring next year, whereas Scholz will be running as his party’s candidate for the chancellor job.

    "text": "Credit Suisse Group AG said Wednesday that the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority, or Finma, has decided to open enforcement proceedings related to the surveillance scandal that has hit the reputation of the Swiss bank. The bank said it \"takes note of the decision\" and \"will continue to fully cooperate with Finma.\" \"The board of directors and the executive board of Credit Suisse agree and unequivocally affirm that the observation of employees is not part of the culture of Credit Suisse,\" it said. No further comments will be made until the authority presents its findings, the bank said. The spying scandal, stemming from the surveillance of two Credit Suisse executives, began in September last year and led to the resignation of Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam. Mr. Thiam said he hadn't known about the surveillance before it became public and regretted it had happened.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/coronavirus-update-global-case-tally-tops-255-million-and-us-climbs-to-603-million-as-midwest-states-suffer-rise-in-infections-2020-09-01?mod=home-page",
    "text": "The number of confirmed cases in the U.S. of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 rose to 6.03 million on Tuesday, with new cases increasing in much of the Midwest and falling from their July peaks in the South and West. The U.S. added more than 36,000 new cases on Monday, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University, while more than 480 deaths were counted. Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota counted more cases in a recent seven-day stretch than any other seen since the start of the outbreak, the New York Times reported. The U.S. accounts for about a quarter of the 25.5 million confirmed cases globally and almost a fifth of the 851,781 deaths counted by Johns Hopkins, or 183,733. On a per capita basis, the U.S. is fourth in the world with 55.95 deaths per 100,000 people, the data shows, after Peru, Chile and Brazil. Twitter removed a post that was retweeted by President Donald Trump at the weekend, claiming the U.S. death toll is greatly exaggerated. The post was sent by “Mel Q,” an adherent of the QAnon conspiracy theory. It claimed that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had updated its COVID-19 numbers and found only 9,000 of reported deaths were from the virus, while the rest were people with two or three other serious illnesses. Twitter said the post violated its coronavirus misinformation policy. The social-media site did not remove another post retweeted by Trump from a conservative website that criticized key members of Trump’s own White House task force, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Diseases, and Dr. Deborah Birx, coordinator of the task force. Fauci told ABC in an interview Tuesday that the CDC numbers did not mean that people died of causes other than COVID-19. “That does not mean that someone who has hypertension or diabetes who dies of Covid didn’t die of Covid-19. They did,” Fauci said on “Good Morning America.”  “So the numbers you’ve been hearing -- there are 180,000-plus deaths -- are real deaths from Covid-19. Let (there) not be any confusion about that.” The head of the World Health Organization said the idea that high death rates from the virus are not a concern if it’s mainly older people who are dying is “moral bankruptcy.” “Accepting someone to die because of age is moral bankruptcy at its highest, and we shouldn’t allow our society to behave this way,” WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at the agency’s latest press briefing. • Russia has more than 1 million confirmed cases of COVID-19, the English-language Moscow Times reported, the fourth highest in the world, after the U.S., Brazil and India. Russia will start its first mass deliveries of its COVID-19 vaccine this month, Health Minister Mikhail Murashko said on Monday. The governor of a remote Siberian region, the republic of Tyva on the border with Mongolia, is reported to have contracted the virus for a second time in Russia’s first such case, the paper reported. Hong Kong researchers last week confirmed a case of a patient who had been reinfected with COVID-19. That same week, two European patients were reported to have suffered that fate, the Guardian reported, citing regional public broadcasters in the Netherlands and Belgium. • Poland has banned direct flights from 44 countries, including Spain and the U.S., to contain the spread of the virus, the Guardian reported, citing government officials. India, Brazil, Argentina, Malta, Montenegro, Mexico, Israel and Romania are also on the list, the paper reported, but China and Russia have been removed, local media reported. The ban will become effective on Wednesday. Poland has 67,922 confirmed cases of the virus, according to the Johns Hopkins data, and 2,058 people have died. • Tourism traffic to Spain fell 75% in July from the year-earlier period, according to Spain’s National Statistics Institute, costing the country billions of euros in lost revenue. Spain is currently grappling with a fresh spike in cases, after recording almost 24,000 new infections over the weekend. In the past two weeks, Spain has seen more than 96,000 new infections, according to its health ministry, making it a hot spot for the outbreak for the second time. Madrid is the epicenter, with about 16% of area hospital beds currently occupied by COVID-19 patients. • Hong Kong launched a mass testing program on Tuesday, amid heightened tensions with mainland China following its efforts to crack down on the city’s democracy movement. The free scheme has had a shaky start, amid concerns that the involvement of doctors and testing companies from the mainland will lead to harvesting of DNA and other data, the Washington Post reported. “I’m postulating that in the most optimistic case, perhaps a million people will turn up, but if I say that, I will be announced as unpatriotic,” said Gabriel Choi Kin, head of the Hong Kong Medical Association, the paper reported. “Ultimately, this will be a display of whether citizens trust the government.” • More than a million students returned to schools in the Chinese city of Wuhan on Tuesday, the original source of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to media reports. Wuhan was locked down for more than two months starting in late January and has reopened gradually since April. About 3,869 inhabitants of the city died from the virus, according to official Chinese data, accounting for more than 80% of China’s total official death toll of 4,724. Students had their temperatures taken at the school gates and were given lessons on hand washing, according to the New York Times. At least 16.9 million people have tested positive and then recovered from COVID-19, the Johns Hopkins data show. Brazil is second to the U.S. with 3.9 million cases and 121,381 deaths. India is next with 3.7 million cases and 65,228 deaths. Mexico has 599,560 cases but 64,414 deaths, the fourth highest in the world. The U.K. has 338,085 cases and 41,589 deaths, the highest in Europe and fifth highest in the world. AstraZeneca said the Phase III trial is seeking up to 30,000 participants to test the vaccine, designated as AZD1222. Participants will either receive two doses of AZD1222 or a saline placebo four weeks apart. In July, AstraZeneca said an early-to-mid-stage study showed the vaccine was “well tolerated and generated robust immune responses” against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. American manufacturers grew again in August for the fourth straight month, but companies still aren’t bringing back lots of workers or seeking to increase investment with the coronavirus pandemic still infecting the economy, MarketWatch’s Jeffry Bartash reported. The Institute for Supply Management said its manufacturing index rose to 56% in August from 54.2% in July. Readings over 50% indicate growth. Economists surveyed by MarketWatch had forecast the index to total 54.9%. Althought the index hit a 21-month high, manufacturers aren’t doing as well now as they were two years ago. Businesses executives are asked if their companies are doing better or worse compared with the prior month, but the survey doesn’t reveal how much better. Most manufacturers are producing fewer goods with fewer workers than they were before the coronavirus pandemic. The index had fallen to an 11-year low of 41.5% in April during the height of the crisis. The index for new orders jumped to 67.6% from 61.5%, marking the highest level since 2004. Yet other measures of actual production show new orders are actually still about 5% below precrisis levels. The production gauge rose to 63.3% from 62.1%. Timothy Fiore, chairman of the survey, said executives were “generally optimistic” but “to a lesser degree compared with July.” Coronavirus cases spiked during the summer and sapped the economy of some of the momentum built up in May and June. “Not all firms have the capacity to bring all of their staff back from furlough and those that do face difficult challenges in figuring out how and when to safely bring their workers back to work,” economists Thomas Simons and Aneta Markowska of Jefferies LLC wrote to clients. Apple Inc. shares  are up 1.7% in premarket trading Tuesday after J.P. Morgan analyst Samik Chatterjee raised his price target to $150 from a split-adjusted $115. Chatterjee wrote that \"investors have widely acknowledged the rich valuation\" of Apple's stock after the company became the first in the U.S. to notch a $2 trillion valuation in late August, but he still sees room to run for the shares. \"While the $2 trillion market cap valuation in itself is a significant milestone, that Apple shares crossed it in a year with significant COVID-19 disruption testifies to the recurring nature of not only its services, but also its products, such that investors are now willing to pay a services-like premium on the entire earnings stream and a modest premium on account of expectations for further revenue/earnings upside,\" Chatterjee said in a note to clients. Also on Tuesday, Bloomberg reported that Apple has asked its suppliers to build at least 75 million 5G iPhones in the coming months, which is similar to what the company asked for during its prior launch, a signal that Apple is seeing stability in its business despite the COVID-19 crisis. Apple shares have gained 60% over the past three months as the Dow Jones Industrial Average  has increased 12%. Ciara Linnane is MarketWatch's investing- and corporate-news editor.

    "title": "This university created its own COVID-19 test and is testing students twice a week — but is it enough to prevent an outbreak?",
    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-university-created-its-own-covid-19-test-and-is-testing-students-twice-a-week-experts-are-watching-to-see-if-its-enough-to-prevent-an-outbreak-11598648724?mod=home-page",
    "text": "Over the roughly week and a half that Ian Katsnelson has been back at his college, the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, the junior has developed a “mini competition” with his friends to see who can finish the process of taking their COVID-19 tests the fastest. “The hardest part for sure is garnering enough saliva,” Katsnelson said of the rapid saliva test, which was created by scientists at the school. He’s perfecting his strategy for his trips to the tents where testing takes place: “I’ve built up my saliva in line before I’ve even gotten inside the tent, so I can get in and get out real quick.” Hallie Workman, a PhD candidate in communications at U of I said, “there’s a lot of scouting that goes on” as students try to find out which of the more than a dozen testing tents on campus have the shortest line. “I have my tent in my time of day that always works well,” Workman, 30, said. “You just sit there trying not to make eye contact with people as you dribble spit into a tube.” These were just some of the rituals that marked an unusual first week of classes at the University of Illinois, which is requiring students, faculty and staff accessing campus to get tested for COVID-19 twice a week as part of its reopening plan. As colleges across the country have sent students home or back to remote classes amid COVID outbreaks, officials at the University of Illinois are hopeful that their approach to mitigating the pandemic’s spread on campus — which includes a test developed at the school that is now being performed under the Federal Drug Administration’s emergency use authorization — will be enough to keep students in some in-person classes through November.  It’s not a small undertaking. The school had 51,000 students in the fall of 2019. Since July 6, the school has processed 121,333 COVID tests and in the five days leading up to Friday, which marked the end of the first week of classes, the school administered 47,075 tests and had a 0.75% positivity rate. For context, there were roughly 730,000 COVID tests administered in the entire U.S. on a recent August day, according to Johns Hopkins University’s Coronavirus Resource Center. On Aug. 24, U of I administered more than 17,000 tests alone. So far, the number of positive cases is in line with what the school’s modelers predicted — well under 400 cases in the week before classes began. The next couple of weeks will be a “defining moment” for U of I as it works to prevent the spread of COVID-19 on campus and in the community, said Robert Jones, the school’s chancellor. “We know that people are watching,” he told MarketWatch. And indeed, according to Joshua Salomon, the director of the Prevention Policy Modeling Lab at Stanford University, “people are really going to be watching this carefully,” describing the efforts the school has taken as “encouraging.” “We don’t know whether it’s going to succeed,” he added. “What we do know is that the likelihood of succeeding without testing is very small.” At many universities that have reopened their campuses for in-person instruction, students may have been tested upon reentry to university housing or campus more broadly and may be subject to random screening. But models from researchers at Yale School of Public Health and U of I, indicate that in order to prevent an outbreak on a college campus — and not just monitor one — students and those interacting with them regularly need to be tested multiple times per week. U of I may be the only university in the country hewing to that standard. Officials will know around Sept. 25, one month and one day after the start of classes, if their efforts have worked, said Rebecca Lee Smith, an associate professor of pathobiology at U of I who is part of the team that developed the school’s testing and other protocols. “We’re going to be keeping track of how well we’re doing going from test results to isolation to contact tracing and quarantine,” Smith said. They’ll also be looking out for new positive cases, a sign of community spread. The outcome that they’re hoping for “is to minimize the infections, get it under control and to protect the health of campus and the community,” Smith said. The school began working to prepare for the fall semester shortly after classes went remote in the spring, said Martin Burke, a chemistry professor at the University of Illinois and chair of the SHIELD committee, the team that is guiding the university’s approach to reopening. They realized relatively quickly that in order to bring students back to campus, they would need to test frequently and get results back rapidly, something that wasn’t going to be possible with a nasal swab test. That led to what Burke described as a “Manhattan Project-style effort,” at the university  to develop their own test. Ultimately they were able to do so in about six weeks, he said. Now the school is working to expand access to the test to the rest of the state of Illinois and even to other areas of the country and around the world. “Testing is not a silver bullet, but it’s a very powerful component,” Burke said. In addition to the testing, the school developed an app where students, faculty and staff receive test results and reminders, and a boarding pass-style image indicating a negative COVID test that allow them access to campus buildings. Users can also enable the app to notify them when they’ve been in close proximity to someone who tested positive for COVID through the use of an anonymized Bluetooth scanning system. U of I is also taking many of the same steps as other campuses  — moving large lecture courses online, moving smaller in-person courses to large rooms to allow for social distancing and requiring masks. The school also has “every high expectation” of students, Jones said. “By agreeing to come back and be here that they have to take ownership to keep themselves safe.” Those who are participating in on-campus activities and don’t follow testing and isolation guidelines could be subject to student discipline. For a university to have a shot at reopening successfully, it needs to hold classes online or outside when possible, have a good system for testing and contact tracing, and have clear and transparent metrics for when it will change course, Salomon said. (Asked about what would trigger a move to remote instruction, Jones said “one of the key metrics, we’re keeping our eye on is the number of positive cases.”) All of these are costly  and administratively challenging undertakings. Jones said his best “guesstimate” is that the school’s testing component alone will cost $7 to $10 million per semester. But a major obstacle to any successful reopening, is just the status of the spread of the virus itself, Salomon said. “We’re still very much in the middle of a raging pandemic,” he said. “With that amount of transmission in communities and bringing together students from around the country, we know that there will be people infected upon arrival. It raises the bar on what needs to be done to interrupt transmission and cut it off.” During the first week of classes, when the school onboarded tens of thousands of students, “the main hiccup” in its system was turning test results around fast enough so that students, faculty and staff would have access to buildings they needed to be in for class, Smith said. Those who haven’t had a negative test result in the last four days can’t get into university buildings, except their own residence hall. Still, the school has been turning test results around “well within” the 48 hour window they’ve promised, she said. Workman was one of those affected by the hiccup. She got tested on a Monday, which was one of the testing days assigned to her by the school, but didn’t get her results back in time to teach her 8 a.m. Tuesday class in person. She “had to call an audible and tell my class we were meeting on Zoom.” When the two public speaking classes she was teaching started last week, roughly 5% of her students couldn’t attend because they’d tested positive for the virus, Workman said. That’s one metric Workman said she’ll be keeping an eye on as she evaluates whether to keep teaching in person. If enough students can’t attend class face-to-face because of quarantine or isolation, she’ll transition to remote instruction, though her preference is to continue teaching in-person classes — the widespread testing has made her feel comfortable doing so. Owen Stephenson was eager to come to campus for his freshman year to gain some independence, even if he would be taking most of his classes online. So far, he’s felt like the testing has gone smoothly; he received his first two test results on the same day he tested and his only quibble was a 45-minute wait on a weekend, when there are fewer testing tents available. The required testing is part of what makes Stephenson feel like he can keep himself safe, regardless of other students’ behavior. “Their testing is the only thing that sets them apart from other universities trying to go back,” he said of U of I’s plan. From her observations in class, Workman said it seems as if students are committed to making the school’s reopening program work because they want to stick around for the semester. Still, she said, the changes to the college experience required during this time — more rules for engaging on campus, more online courses than typical — have left her students so drained that she ended a recent class 20 minutes early. “They had this feeling that once they were finally able to get back on campus, that life would feel more normal and it’s not.” Grocery shoppers are cutting back on spending, data show, a sign that Americans are hurting for cash as the federal unemployment stimulus remains on hold for most recipients.

    "text": "This interview is the third in a series of conversations MarketWatch is conducting with some of the leading voices in the U.S. on the COVID-19 pandemic. Back in April, Dr. Dixie Harris and about 100 nurses and doctors from the Intermountain Healthcare hospital system in Utah flew to New York City to work in the region’s overburdened hospitals. Harris, a pulmonologist who studies e-cigarette vaping, worked for days in a row, caring for COVID-19 patients when the region’s local hospitals were overwhelmed. It was at Southside Hospital in Bay Shore, N.Y., that she started to learn about the virus, about why it’s better to put patients prone, why ventilators aren’t always the best option — and the importance of wearing a face mask. “One hundred of us went,” she said. “Zero came back positive.” Back home in the much more sparsely populated state of Utah, cases peaked at 876 on July 9, according to the Utah Department of Health. About 400 people in total have died as a result of a COVID-19 infection. (New York state has reported a total of 430,774 cases and 25,297 deaths as of Aug. 25.) As cases have declined, more of Harris’ focus has turned to patients who had COVID-19 in the spring and are still dealing with myriad health problems and symptoms months later. Many of these patients in the U.S. call themselves “long haulers.” They have reported fatigue, chest pain and neurological damage. “One of my first long-hauler patients had symptoms in March,” she said. “Five months later, and this patient was never in the hospital. That’s who I’m mostly seeing: patients who haven’t been in the hospital but continue to have ongoing symptoms.” Dr. Dixie Harris: We were there three weeks in April. It was pretty intense. It was right as the peak was going down, but there were still six times the number of ICU patients or more for the hospital I was working in. From what I could see, it hit pretty much within a week. It went from next to no COVID patients to overwhelming the whole system. I’ve had other people ask me, “Why didn’t they just ship some of those patients to another hospital?” Well, every hospital in Long Island was overrun with patients. And all the ambulances were so busy bringing new patients in, it’s not like they could say, “Oh, we’ll take this one patient all the way up to Albany. “ A tsunami is what they called it because there was no warning and it hit all at once. It was an incredibly dynamic learning environment. From when we started to when I left, care changed markedly. We were intubating early on. And then we said, “Wait a second, once they go on the ventilator, they’re on for three weeks. What can we do to avoid this?” The big key is proning. Even if you get some respiratory symptoms but you don’t have to be in the hospital, go ahead and move. Prone. Don’t just lay in the bed on your back at home. I will say it’s really hard to lay on your belly when your BMI is 45. When you’re really obese, it feels like you can’t breathe. So I tell the patients to sit up, lean forward. You’re trying to get the back upright. It was an honor to get to go there. The head of Northwell Health came when we were leaving about to get on the plane and came in to thank us. They did a water cannon salute in New York at the airport. When we were in the waiting area right at the jet way, probably 30, 40 people showed up and just gave us a shout-out clap. All wearing masks, all distanced. MarketWatch: It looks like Utah’s peak was in July. How is it different caring for patients there even now? Harris: We haven’t been overwhelmed. We have not had our ICUs completely full and so because of that we’re doing cutting edge best care possible. Every COVID patient is presented to infectious disease to decide which meds they qualify for. Harris: The laypeople are calling it long haulers. The British Medical Journal just did a nice review on management of post-acute COVID patients. They’re calling it long COVID. In the medical community, we haven’t fully named it. But I’m [also] aware of patients who consider themselves long haulers who have never (been) diagnosed positive for COVID. They feel they have it because they have the symptoms, the time frame, and all that. Harris: That’s really what we are just learning. Who I get are patients who two to three months later are still having shortness of breath, still having aches and pains, and maybe chest symptoms. Many of them are still on oxygen. Now mind you, we are at higher elevation. So some of these patients would not necessarily be hypoxic if they were at sea level. Still, these are people who are used to living here, so their body is adjusted to it. Dr. Kirk Knowlton, [Intermountain’s director of cardiovascular research, critical care physician Dr. Eliotte Hirshberg] and I are going to be talking to our leadership about developing protocols to take care of these patients. Part of it is to acknowledge that patients are still having symptoms. One of my first long-hauler patients had symptoms in March. I talked to the patient a week and a half ago, and he is still having a little bit of symptoms [but is] markedly better. Back to work now. But five months later, and this patient was never in the hospital. That’s who I’m mostly seeing: patients who haven’t been in the hospital but continue to have ongoing symptoms. In the BMJ article that just was published, they’re saying that 10% of patients who test positive remain unwell after three weeks. Their definition is if you have symptoms more than three weeks, you’re going into the long haulers. A lot of people are calling long haulers a month out. My colleague and I are presenting to our leadership — he’s a cardiologist, and I’m a pulmonologist — but we’re the ones who are aware of these cases two, three, four, or five months later. The fatigue and the memory issues. Depression. There’s a lot of non-pulmonary issues. Muscle aches. Anxiety. Everybody’s anxious in the day of COVID, right? Everybody’s stressed. Everybody’s had to adjust and learn. Primary care’s going to be addressing more and more of this. And our psychiatric services are going to be seeing this. My long haulers, most of them are on oxygen, and they all have pulmonary symptoms. But every time I see them, they’re a little bit better. I do see improvement over time. I will say that things such as prolonged symptoms — fatigue, that kind of thing — has been reported in MERS and SARS. MarketWatch: It’s not just a respiratory illness. Harris: Right. It’s a blood vessel illness. It’s a brain illness. It’s a muscle illness. MarketWatch: You’ve done some research around vaping and smoking. How do you talk to patients about these types of things in the context of COVID? Harris: It’s pretty well established that vaping nicotine does weaken the immune system. It especially affects how the nose can fight viruses. And how does COVID get in the system? Eyes, nose, mouth, right? You saw more cases of EVALI (e-cigarette, or vaping, product use associated lung injury) in April and May. A lot of the EVALI, like 90% to 95%, is due to the tainted THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) oil. [THC is the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis that makes people feel “high.”] I think people are going to THC with the stress of all the quarantines and all the changes. It makes sense people are reaching for that. Whatever you do, don’t vape the THC. This Q&A has been edited for clarity and length. • Dr. Osterholm: Americans will be living with the coronavirus for decades VirnetX Holding Corp.  received a positive court ruling Wednesday, as the  internet security software and technology company disclosed that the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas has denied Apple Inc.'s  motion for relief from a judgment in the VirnetX vs. Apple patent case. The ruling is related to the case in which VirnetX was awarded total damages of $439.7 million as Apple was found to have infringed on VirnetX's patents. In February, Apple was denied a rehearing of the case. VirnetX's stock was still inactive in premarket trading, while Apple shares gained 1.8% toward record territory. Year to date, shares of VirnetX have rallied 35.3%, Apple has run up 82.8% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average  has tacked on 0.4%. Jaimy Lee is a health-care reporter for MarketWatch.

    "text": "On Aug. 26, the Food and Drug Administration granted an Emergency Use Authorization to a new rapid antigen test for COVID-19 called the BinaxNOW test. I study public health policy to combat infectious disease epidemics. Testing is one of the most powerful tools available to fight the spread of COVID-19. The new test is inexpensive, rapid and easy to use. It will massively scale up access to testing, but hurdles remain in achieving widespread, frequent COVID-19 testing. The credit-card-sized test is an antigen test that detects a specific viral protein from SARS-CoV-2. It costs $5 and doesn’t require a lab or a machine for processing. Performing the test is simple. A health-care worker or technician would use a swab to collect a sample from less than 1 inch inside the nostril. They would then combine the sample with a few drops of chemicals inside the test card. Within 15 minutes, the test strip would show a positive or negative result. The test is also paired with an app that produces a digital code that can be scanned to show proof of a recent negative COVID-19 test. The BinaxNOW test is currently only authorized for patients who have had COVID-19 symptoms for seven days or less, which is when virus levels in the body are likely to be high. It must be prescribed by a physician and performed by a trained technicianor other health-care worker. The PCR test for COVID-19 is currently widely used and considered the gold standard, but requires patient samples to be sent to a lab and can take days to provide results. The new antigen test is designed to be a cheap and quick alternative to PCR testing for diagnostic purposes in a medical setting. It would add critical capacity to an overstretched testing system. The emergency use authorization provides preliminary authorization for doctors to prescribe the antigen test while the full FDA approval process is ongoing. The authorization could be revoked if the test is not as accurate or reliable as expected. However, the true accuracy could be lower because the performance testing group was only 102 people and the accuracy hasn’t been validated by the FDA as part of the full approval process. There will inevitably be some false negatives and false positives with the BinaxNOW test since accuracy isn’t 100%, but the FDA will monitor the data to make sure the test meets the reported accuracy. The BinaxNOW test is cheap, rapid, able to be mass-produced and easy to use outside a lab. This makes it a promising candidate for widespread screening. However, the test is currently only authorized for people with COVID-19 symptoms. This is an obstacle because an estimated 40% of all COVID-19 cases are asymptomatic and these people likely don’t know that they’re contagious. To maximize the effectiveness of any COVID-19 screening program, it is important to test people whether they have symptoms or not. Health-care providers are able to prescribe the BinaxNOW test for asymptomatic patients for off-label use, but health officials don’t yet know how accurate the test is when performed on asymptomatic people. The massive expansion of testing access made possible by the BinaxNOW test will almost surely outweigh the downsides of a small number of inaccurate results. Abbott plans to manufacture 50 million tests per month starting in October. This will quickly exceed the 76 million COVID-19 tests the U.S. has performed over the last six months. Widespread, frequent testing is effective at slowing the spread of the coronavirus. The new testing capacity made possible by the authorization of this rapid antigen test represents a major advance in bringing the pandemic under control.

Europe’s common currency eased after Philip Lane, chief economist at the European Central Bank, reportedly voiced concern over the euro-dollar rate. “If there are forces moving the euro-dollar rate around, that feeds into our global and European forecasts and that in turn does feed into our monetary policy setting,” Lane said in an online conference on Tuesday evening. The comments weren’t too surprising and the ECB will probably stick to verbal intervention instead of cutting rates, Gizem Kara, economist at BNP Paribas in London, told clients in a note. The economist said “risk-reward of cutting is not favorable right now” and if the market perceives the ECB has used up its firepower, the currency could even rise.

    "text": "Investors are betting people will go back to the movies. Wednesday’s premarket gains cut year-to-date losses in the stock to about 10%. Not bad for a company that posted a first-half 2020 loss of more than $25 a share and which was forced to suspend its 20-cent quarterly dividend. What’s more, shares are up about 230% from their 52-week low. The market expects things to keep improving. Hollywood, for one, is trying to help entice moviegoers back into theaters. AMC’s reopening plan coincides with Christopher Nolan’s thriller Tenet hitting U.S. screens. The film earned $53 million in the overseas box office last weekend, a meager sum for such a highly touted film in a pre-Covid world, but amid coronavirus lockdowns, the number looks great. Two top White House officials said Tuesday that a deal on a fresh round of coronavirus relief spending could still be reached, despite talks with Democrats stalling for more than a month. What’s Next: A smaller proposal is unlikely to break the deadlock. A so-called skinny bill has been repeatedly shot down by Democrats, who have insisted on a package commensurate with what they see as the size of the current crisis. The Senate is back in session next Tuesday. The largest school district in the U.S. delayed the start of in-person teaching after Mayor Bill de Blasio and the teachers union reached an agreement and averted the threat of a strike over classroom safety concerns amid the coronavirus pandemic. What’s Next: Teachers will return to school buildings on Sept. 8. The first day of in-person classes was moved to Sept. 21 from Sept. 10. Remote learning is delayed to Sept. 16 from Sept. 10. President Donald Trump traveled to Kenosha, Wis., on Tuesday to visit businesses that were damaged in the city during nights of unrest following the shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man, by police on Aug. 23. Protests and unrest have become a central theme of his re-election campaign. What’s Next: Joe Biden, who challenged Trump Monday to join him in condemning violence, is expected to break August fundraising records. The Biden campaign raised $70 million during its convention and a total of $300 million this month. The Trump campaign hasn’t reported its total, but raised $76 million during its convention. What’s Next: The inquiry could prove embarrassing for the two ruling coalition parties, Merkel’s conservative CDU and Scholz’s social-democratic SPD, one year before the general election to take place in the fall of 2021. But Merkel is retiring then, whereas Scholz will be running as his party’s candidate for the chancellor job. What’s Next: McDonald’s has pledged to increase diversity in the wake of George Floyd’s killing in police custody and had been in talks to settle with the Black franchisees since June, but those negotiations broke down, a lawyer for the franchisees said. I have been married to my husband for 38 years and we have three children together. When his mother passed away he received an inheritance of $8,000. I was never told about this money, and he spent all of it before I found out he even received his inheritance. When my father passed away, it was my father’s intent that any inheritance we received would be kept in my father’s family, so naturally my inheritance was made out to me and me alone. I deposited the money into a checking account with just my name on it. Within 30 days of receiving my inheritance, I purchased a home with the proceeds, and I was talked into putting my husband’s name on the deed. The check given to the seller’s attorney was a cashier’s check with my name alone. If I die before my husband is it possible to put the house into a living trust given that my father’s intent was to keep the money within the family, and not my married husband’s family? I want this home to be an inheritance for our children, and I don’t want him to sell it as soon as I die. I wish to make sure that he doesn’t sell it or rent it out in his lifetime. I would like him to live there until he dies. He has paid for a couple of renovations to the home. How would I go about making sure that my kids will have this home as an inheritance assuming I predecease my husband? —A.G. Read The Moneyist’s response.

    "text": "A bearish analyst on Tesla Inc.  is now a little less bearish, saying the electric vehicle maker has become one of the most important stocks in the U.S. stock market, but said the stock remains fundamentally overvalued. The stock surged 6.8% in premarket trading Tuesday, after soaring 12.6% on Monday. RBC Capital's Joseph Spak lifted is price target to $290, which implies a 42% drop from Monday's record close of $498.32, from $170, while maintaining the underperform rating he's had on the stock since January 2019. \"We recognize we underestimated a critical valuation point: seemingly insatiable investor demand for alternative/clean vehicles,\" Spak wrote in a note to clients. He said he also believes investors have willing to show more patience and look further out for companies like Tesla. \"That being said, we struggle to explain the run-up to the stock split which academically doesn't change the value of Tesla equity but could help fuel investor interest,\" Spak wrote. \"We still view Tesla as fundamentally overvalued and having to grow into its valuation.\" Of the 36 analysts surveyed by FactSet, just 19% are bullish, 31% are bearish, and 50% are neutral.

    "title": "Only 19% of Tesla analysts say buy the stock while investors remain ‘insatiable’",
    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/only-19-of-tesla-analysts-say-buy-the-stock-while-investors-remain-insatiable-2020-09-01?mod=home-page",
    "text": "There is an old Wall Street saying that investing isn’t about being right or wrong, it’s about making money. No one understands that better than an investor in Tesla Inc.’s stock. The financial fundamentals and the historical valuations of earnings suggest the market is wrong about the electric vehicle (EV) maker’s stock price, according to the overwhelming majority of Tesla analysts. But the stock keeps rising and Tesla investors keep making money. No one is making more money than Elon Musk, Tesla’s chief executive officer, largest shareholder and arguably its most important cheerleader, who just became the third-richest person in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak, who has been bearish on Tesla since Jan. 23 2019, when the stock closed at $57.52, put it this way in a note to clients: Spak raised his price target to $290 from $170, but his target was still 42% below Monday’s closing price. See related: His short position just got ‘obliterated,’ but this Tesla bear isn’t giving up. Also read: Tesla takes advantage of stock’s best month in 7 years with $5 billion offering. There are some fundamental reasons for investors being right to buy, as Tesla has been profitable for four straight quarters, while Wall Street was wrong to expect losses in three of the past four quarters. And despite concerns about the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, Tesla delivered way more EVs than expected during the second quarter. While the 5-for-1 stock split Tesla announced on Aug. 11 didn’t improve the company’s fundamentals in any way, investors were right to buy or hold on to their shares, for now, as the price has charged up more than 80% since the announcement through Monday. Read more: Tesla stock rally accelerates further into record territory after split takes effect. Despite such strong investor conviction, 81% of analysts don’t recommend buying. Of the 36 analysts surveyed by FactSet, only seven, or 19%, have the equivalent of buy ratings on Tesla’s stock. And only one of those analysts, Jefferies’s Philippe Houchois, had a price target — $500 — that was above Monday’s closing price. Meanwhile, half the analysts had the equivalent of hold ratings and 11 analysts, or 31%, had the equivalent of sell ratings. The average price target of all the analysts was $261.85, according to FactSet, which implied a 47% drop from Monday’s closing price. Most of what analysts have been wrong about Tesla has taken place over roughly the past five months. At the end of March, when the COVID-19 crisis was full blown, there were the same number of bearish analysts as there are now and the average stock price target was $101.86, just 2.8% below the March 31 closing price of $104.80. With the stock’s gain since then, Tesla’s market capitalization increased to $464.3 billion as of Monday’s close, which was the seventh highest among U.S. companies. RBC’s Spak suggested that what may also keep supporting the stock is that given the sheer market valuation of Tesla, many portfolio managers have to add to positions “just to keep pace.” He also believes investors have been willing to show more patience and look further into the future to value the stock. “We still view Tesla as fundamentally overvalued and having to grow into its valuation,” Spak wrote. Spak recognizes that Tesla is clearly ahead of its competition, has relatively inexpensive access to capital, the ability to attract talent, an “incredible” brand, and understands that “narrative, momentum and other factors” can impact the stock price. But he still believes that ultimately, a company’s value is related to fundamental factors. Basically, he’s suggesting that one of the biggest risk factors to Tesla’s stock isn’t good or bad fundamental news, but how investors value that news. The next major potential news catalyst is Tesla’s “battery day” scheduled for Sept. 22, of which Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said recently he’s expecting a number of potential “game changing” developments. One of those developments is the “million mile” battery, which in theory will support an EV for 1 million miles, which could put Tesla miles ahead of its traditional gasoline-powered automotive competitors. That said, Ives is one of the analysts that doesn’t recommend buying — he’s at hold — while his price target of $380 suggests the stock could fall 24%. For those looking for actual fundamental risks, the following are just some of those included in the more than 20 pages of “risk factors” Tesla lists in its latest quarterly report filed on July 28. So far, those risks haven't mattered to Tesla investors. • “We are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer.” • “We have been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by the global COVID-19 pandemic, the duration and economic, governmental and social impact of which is difficult to predict, which may significantly harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.” • “We have experienced in the past, and may experience in the future, delays or other complications in the design, manufacture, launch, and production ramp of our vehicles, energy products, and product features, or may not realize our manufacturing cost targets, which could harm our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.” • “Our future growth and success is dependent upon consumers’ willingness to adopt electric vehicles and specifically our vehicles. We operate in the automotive industry, which is generally susceptible to cyclicality and volatility.” • “Any issues or delays in meeting our projected timelines, costs and production at or funding the ramp of Gigafactory Shanghai, or any difficulties in generating and maintaining local demand for vehicles manufactured there, could adversely impact our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition.” • “If our vehicles or other products that we sell or install fail to perform as expected, our ability to develop, market and sell our products and services could be harmed.” • “The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and we may not be successful in competing in these industries. We currently face competition from new and established domestic and international competitors and expect to face competition from others in the future, including competition from companies with new technology.” These tech companies have yet to report financial results for the quarter but have demonstrated they are benefiting from the pandemic.

    "text": "A record-setting August for stocks has set the bar high, but September may be off to an upbeat start, led by technology. That brings us to our call of the day from Schwab Center for Financial Research’s vice president of trading and derivatives, Randy Frederick, who thinks the stock market may finally deliver on some much-needed corrections. “We haven’t had anything of that nature at all since going all the way back to early June, when we had that big drop-off. We’re clearly way overdue on that,” Frederick said. And while 3,700 sounds “pretty remarkable from a bottom-of-the-virus return,” on a year-to-date basis that 14% gain for the S&P 500 is fairly average, he noted. When those smallish pullbacks come along, though, he advises against panic (he urged no panic in early March too), saying “they will be and should be used as buying opportunities.” That is  because there is nowhere else for investors to put their money as any Federal Reserve interest rate increase is years out, said Frederick. And investors should learn from those who panicked out of the market in 2008 and missed out on an 11-year bull market, he added. One potential correction trigger is technical, as he says 2020 has been closely tracking the action in 2009. That year saw three pullbacks — 3.5%, 4.3% and 5.6% in the last few months of 2009 — as his chart shows: A “substantial pullback in earnings could also trigger a pullback,” he said, noting that second-quarter S&P 500 earnings per share came in far better than expected. Frederick is watching the coronavirus pandemic as a potential trigger, with schools opening across the country and the potential for a dramatic uptick in the case count spooking markets, while trade issues with China shouldn’t be dismissed, as they also have the power to unhinge markets. Another stick of dynamite for stocks is continued wrangling over enhanced unemployment benefits in the U.S. “That’s a big issue that needs to be resolved on what they should do to support workers and small business going forward,” said Frederick.

    "text": "At the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, close to eight of 10 MBA students say they are not excited about the coming fall semester because the coronavirus pandemic has forced classes online. At UCLA’s Anderson School of Management, newly admitted international students are outraged that they cannot defer their admission to the school’s MBA program even if they cannot get a student visa to come to the U.S. At New York University’s Stern School of Business, students are demanding the reversal of a 3.5% increase in MBA tuition during COVID-19 and asking for a 5% to 10% discount on the price of their degrees because of the shift to virtual classes. Add to all of the anxiety and frustration the fact that some graduates from the most prestigious business schools, including Harvard and Stanford universities, saw their summer internships and full-time job offers clawed back by companies due to the COVID recession. Many more are deeply worried about their prospects for landing a job over the next year as still more companies freeze budgets and hiring plans. So is this a time to apply to an MBA program and go even further into debt? You better believe it is, and here’s why. A recession and a health crisis, no matter how severe, will not last forever. But while it lasts, many will find their opportunities to advance at work diminished or completely curtailed. Many more have already found themselves on unemployment. By the time this year’s incoming MBA students graduate in 2023, it is almost a certainty that both COVID-19 and the economic downturn will be in the rearview mirror. The Class of 2023 will inevitably graduate into a fully recovered economy, better prepared to take full advantage of the upturn. No less crucial, they will have been the beneficiaries of not merely the business basics or of the leadership development a strong MBA program provides; they will be steeped in both data analytics, specifically how to smartly harness massive datasets for decision making, and how to leverage new technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, to gain important efficiencies in a business moving forward. Of all the graduate degrees you could earn, an MBA from a highly selective business school is pretty much a no-brainer investment. The top five schools for average starting pay last year — base salary plus signing bonus — are all big names, led by the Wharton School at $172,016, NYU Stern ($168,291), Stanford ($168,226), Dartmouth College’s Tuck School of Business ($166,251), and the University of Virginia’s Darden School of Business ($165,292). In all, 12 schools in the top 25 of U.S. News’s MBA ranking report starting salaries above $160,000, and 17 above $150,000. “If you stayed at work in 2021, your career options and earning potential in 2023 would be more limited if you had gone to business school,” noted Soojin Kwon, managing director of full-time MBA admissions and program at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business. Why? Kwon notes that students will gain three advantages by going back to school that they won’t get by staying in a job during the pandemic. “One, you’ll meet with and learn from hundreds of smart, ambitious and interesting people you wouldn’t have met if you didn’t go to business school,” Kwon said at a recent panel discussion for Poets & Quants.  “Two, you’re going to learn how to network and interview for jobs in an industry or function that you’re interested in going into, and most, if not all MBA recruiters this year are planning to do virtual recruiting. So you’re going to learn how to interview in the format in which recruiters are going to be recruiting. In addition, she said, “You’re going to gain access to a network of tens of thousands of business school alumni and hundreds of thousands of alumni in the broader university community. You could absolutely find another job through LinkedIn, but it’s no secret that you’re more likely to get a response if you have some kind of connection, and an MBA from a top school with the support of alumni provides that invaluable connection for life.” During the Great Recession of 2008-2009, the job situation was just as miserable and prospects for many MBAs appeared so dim that some openly questioned their decision to borrow money to get the degree. Robert Bruner, then dean of the University of Virginia’s Darden School of Business, found himself having to defend the value of the MBA. He rose to the challenge, and his points then made much sense now. Education adds significant value to human potential. “Generally, research finds real rates of return on investment upwards of 10% and as high as 50%. And there is a correlation between years in school and earning power but that’s only the quantitative part. Every year, students graduate who are more self-confident, better communicators, and more promising leaders than when they enrolled. And they have joined an alumni network that has helped in good times and bad.” Indeed, long-term thinking beats short-term thinking all the time. Young professionals have a long career ahead of them. “With the benefits of modern medicine, you can probably look forward to a career of 50 years,” Bruner wrote. “Are you judging the worth of an MBA by only the first job you get out of B-school? Take the long view. If you could discount the marginal benefits of an MBA from a competitive school over the next 50 years, I’d guess that they well exceed the costs. Don’t discount the future too steeply.” Truth is, you can bet with certainty that tough times will again appear once this pandemic is under control and the economy recovers. The ability to assess and bear sensible risks is the core of business and entrepreneurship. Pursuing a graduate degree in business to learn valuable skills, cultivate one’s leadership potential, and acquire a supportive network of connected professionals is a risk worth taking. John A.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/massachusetts-voters-to-decide-bitter-markey-kennedy-primary-fight-2020-09-01?mod=home-page",
    "text": "BOSTON — U.S. Sen. Edward Markey of Massachusetts defeated U.S. Rep. Joe Kennedy III in Tuesday’s hard-fought Democratic primary, harnessing support from progressive leaders to overcome a challenge from a younger rival who is a member of America’s most famous political family. It was the first time a Kennedy has lost a race for Congress in Massachusetts. Markey appealed to voters in the deeply Democratic state by positioning himself as aligned with the liberal wing of the party. He teamed up with a leading progressive, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, on the Green New Deal climate change initiative — and at one point labeled Kennedy “a progressive in name only.” That helped Markey overcome the enduring power of the Kennedy name in Massachusetts. The 39-year-old congressman sought to cast the 74-year-old Markey as someone out of touch after spending decades in Congress, first in the House before moving to the Senate. Kennedy said Tuesday night that the results aren’t the ones he’d hoped for, but pledged to work for Markey’s reelection. “The senator is a good man. You never heard me say otherwise,” Kennedy told supporters at an outdoor rally. Kennedy also suggested that the movement of supporters the campaign pulled together would continue past the current election. “We may have lost the final vote count tonight but we built a coalition that will endure,” he said. “I would this again with all of you in a heartbeat.” In the waning weeks of the campaign, Kennedy leaned into his family’s long political legacy in Massachusetts. His pedigree includes former President John F. Kennedy; former U.S. Senator and U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, his grandfather; and former U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy, who held a Senate seat in Massachusetts for nearly half a century until his death in 2009. Markey countered by leaning into his own family story — growing up in the working class city of Malden with a father who drove a truck for the Hood Milk company. In one campaign video, Markey also paraphrased a famous JFK quote, saying, “We asked what we could do for our country. We went out, we did it. With all due respect, it’s time to start asking what your country can do for you.” Markey also found himself on the defense at times during the campaign, with Kennedy repeatedly trying to portray him as having a tin ear to racial equity concerns. Kennedy faulted Markey for his initial opposition to the effort to desegregate the Boston Public Schools beginning in the 1970s. Markey countered by noting that he changed his views on the contentious issue that tore at the fabric of the city. He also said he supported the creation in 1973 of a state Senate seat aimed at helping elect a Black senator to the Massachusetts Legislature. Kennedy also repeatedly pointed to the father of Danroy “DJ” Henry, a young Black man from Massachusetts killed by police 10 years ago. Henry’s father has criticized Markey, saying he failed to help the family seek justice. Markey said he has apologized to the Henry family and signed a letter seeking a federal Justice Department investigation into the killing. Markey also wasn’t shy about talking about the Kennedy family, at one point pressing Kennedy to tell his father — former U.S. Rep. Joe Kennedy ll — to stop supporting a political action committee that was running ads against Markey. “I’m sure your father is watching right now,” Markey said. “Tell your father right now that you don’t want money to go into a super PAC that runs negative ads.” Kennedy said he had “no idea” if his father was helping fund the PAC. Late in the race, Kennedy also landed a major endorsement when Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi formally backed his candidacy. While Markey, who served with Pelosi in the House for decades, congratulated Kennedy, Pelosi’s decision angered some of Markey’s younger progressive supporters. Markey had earlier won the endorsement of Ocasio-Cortez and fellow Massachusetts Democratic U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren. “Ed Markey wasn’t afraid. He offered his expertise & partnership. He wasn’t scared of big policy & didn’t use kid gloves. It’s great to watch him overcome the odds and win tonight,” Ocasio-Cortez tweeted Tuesday night. The coronavirus upended the way both candidates could reach out to voters — severely limiting more traditional means of electioneering like knocking on doors, shaking hands or holding big rallies. Instead, the campaigns were largely waged online with virtual rallies, virtual endorsements, virtual fundraisers and virtual roundtable events to discuss issues. Eventually, as Massachusetts began to suppress the virus and emerge from a near lockdown, the candidates began to take their campaigns on the road — with appropriate social distancing rules and face masks in tow. The showdown drew criticism from some Democrats nationally who feared it would siphon time and money away from the primary goals of defeating President Donald Trump and winning back control of the Senate, It also wasn’t cheap, with both Kennedy and Markey raising millions to pay for campaign staff, television and digital ads and old-school campaign flyers. Markey now faces a general election contest where he is considered a strong favorite in a district that has historically elected Democrats. He’ll face the winner of the Republican primary, Kevin O’Connor, in November. Copyright © 2020 MarketWatch, Inc. All rights reserved."

    "text": "That’s Mohamed El-Erian,  Allianz’s chief economic adviser,  explaining in an op-ed for the Financial Times how action in the options pits should be taken as a warning by retail investors who have been cashing in on the stock market’s relentless push higher in recent months. “The seemingly endless rally… gives the impression that prices are endorsed and supported by the entire professional investment community,” he said.  “After all, despite the vocal concerns over valuations having split away from underlying corporate and economic fundamentals, few fund managers have been willing to challenge the market by placing outright shorts. “ However, “sophisticated investors” are expressing their cautious views with the use of derivatives, and El-Erian says the mom-and-pop types should take note. “Much of this could be seen as market deepening were it not for one troubling fact: corporate and economic fundamentals have yet to reflect a sustained and convincing recovery from COVID-related damage,” he said. The rebound in consumption is slowing, initial jobless claims are back to the 1 million level for a second straight week, bankruptcies are rising, and, according to El-Erian, it’s looking like these short-term disruptions are about to become long-term scars. “Rather than a well-thought-out bet on the future, stocks reflect many investors’ resolute faith in a consistently favourable and predictable liquidity environment,” he wrote. “It is a backdrop anchored by reliable stimulus from central banks.” On the surface, the same can pretty much be said for what we’re seeing in the derivatives market, but there’s more to it than just that. “The fear of missing out on an unceasing equity rally has increasingly been expressed through call options,” El-Erian said. “Those who would normally short the market on concerns of excessive valuations appear to have no desire to be steamrollered once again by favourable liquidity and the strong ‘buy-the-dip’ conditioning that comes with that.” “It would take a big shock for markets to move significantly lower — such as a renewed sharp economic downturn, a considerable monetary or fiscal policy mistake, or market defaults and liquidity accidents,” he wrote. “But should such a move occur, the likelihood of further market turmoil would be high, especially given the current lack of a short base to buffer the downturn. This exposes small retail investors to big potential losses.” U.S. Sen. Edward Markey defeated U.S. Rep. Joe Kennedy III in Tuesday’s Democratic primary, harnessing support from progressive leaders to overcome a challenge from a younger rival who is a member of America’s most famous political family.

    "text": "U.S. stock-index futures were holding on to firm gains on Wednesday as investors drew hope from improvement on rapid testing for COVID-19, the possibility of a vaccine against the deadly disease, and potential progress in Washington another coronavirus fiscal stimulus package. Investors were digesting a private-sector jobs report that came in weaker than expected, well below the nearly 1 million that had been estimated for the month. An  account of business conditions in parts of the U.S. from the Federal Reserve is due later in the afternoon. Stock markets looked upbeat early Wednesday, with a number of possible catalysts helping the investing mood amid the coronavirus pandemic. Bloomberg reported that U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has again restarted talks with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, sparking fresh hope of another fiscal stimulus plan to help out-of-work Americans. On the health front, the leading health expert Dr. Anthony Fauci said that a COVID-19 pandemic could come sooner than expected if the roster of companies attempting to achieve a cure are able to produce outstanding preliminary results. Speaking to Kaiser Health News, Fauci said that the board that is overseeing vaccine approvals could decided that “the data is so good right now that you can say it’s safe and effective.” The global tally for confirmed cases of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 climbed to 25.8 million on Wednesday, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University, while the death toll rose to 857,552 Early moves in the session come a day after buying in large-capitalization technology stocks and shares tied to pandemic stay-at-home trends led the S&P 500 index to record its 21st record close of 2020 and the Nasdaq Composite its 41st on Tuesday. ADP did, however, raise last month’s jobs figure  to 212,000 for July from  a  rise of 167,000, which was then below forecast of 1.9 million jobs. The economy has recouped fewer than half of the 20 million-plus jobs lost in the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic. In other news, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention late Tuesday implemented a temporary eviction moratorium through the end of the year, protecting millions of U.S. renters from losing their homes during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Trump administration announced. Other economic data, will be watched, including the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book, an anecdotal account of business conditions in the central bank’s districts set to be released at 2 p.m. ET, and before that a report on factory orders for July is due. Reports on U.S. automobile sales will rollout throughout the day. This has been the best month since the April bounce-back, as tech stocks have extended gains.

    "text": "Oil futures traded higher Wednesday, finding support on signs of a slower-than-expected rebound in crude output by the OPEC+ alliance and a steeper-than-expected fall in U.S. inventories. “With one more week of U.S. driving season left, oil prices received a much needed helping hand from a bullish to consensus oil inventory draw,” said Stephen Innes, chief global markets strategist at AxiCorp, in a note. The American Petroleum Institute reported late Tuesday that U.S. crude supplies fell by 6.4 million barrels in the week ended Aug. 28, according to sources. The API data also showed gasoline stockpiles down 5.8 million barrels, while distillate inventories were down by 1.4 million barrels, they said. Crude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, storage hub, meanwhile, declined by 237,000 barrels for the week, sources said. The Energy Information Administration’s more closely watched storage data is due Wednesday morning. It’s expected to show crude inventories fell by 1.2 million barrels last week, according to analysts polled by S&P Global Platts. They also forecast supply declines of 4.7 million barrels for gasoline and 900,000 barrels in distillates. Some analysts played down the importance of the U.S. inventory data over the next few weeks, citing disruptions created by Hurricane Laura, which left nearly a third of oil production in the Gulf of Mexico still shut down as of Tuesday. “The U.S. inventory reports in the next few weeks…are unlikely to be particularly meaningful because the hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico have massively hampered the production and transport of crude oil and oil products,” said Eugen Weinberg, analyst at Commerzbank, in a note. Meanwhile, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries was slow in bringing back production last month as it relaxed output curbs, according to a Bloomberg survey cited by analysts. It found that members increased output by only half the amount allowed after OPEC and its allies, an alliance known as OPEC+, agreed to taper collective outputs to 7.7 million barrels a day beginning in August from 9.7 million barrels a day. Reuters on Tuesday reported that oil production by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries rose by 950,000 barrels per day to 24.27 million barrels per day in August, from July, following a three-decade output low in June. The move followed a decision by OPEC and its allies to taper collective output cuts to 7.7 million barrels per day starting May 1 from record cuts of 9.7 million barrels a day.

A weaker U.S. currency can make gold more attractive to overseas buyers on a relative basis and vice versa. “Bullion’s decline is proportional to the recovery of the greenback, confirming that the current movement is mostly related to what is happening on the currency markets,” wrote Carlo Alberto De Casa, chief analyst at ActivTrades. “In other words, the main trend for gold remains positive and a clear surpass of $1,990 and then $2,005 would open space for further rallies,” he wrote.

    "title": "Rocket Reports Earnings Today. What to Expect.",
    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/rocket-reports-earnings-tomorrow-what-to-expect-51598999503?mod=home-page",
    "text": "Since its public offering, Rocket’s shares (ticker: RKT) have risen 38%, helped by the company’s preliminary second-quarter earnings released in mid-August as part of financial disclosures to bondholders. The company reported net revenue of $5 billion, a 437% increase from the same quarter in 2019, and adjusted Ebitda, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, of $3.8 billion, up 868% from the second quarter last year, the company said in a press release, owing to an elevated gain on sale margin as well as an increase in rate-lock volume. The company will report its official second-quarter earnings on Wednesday. Analysts anticipate generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) earnings of $1.39 per share on sales of $5.3 billion and Ebitda of $3.8 billion. Here are three things analysts are looking for. Bank vs. Tech Even before the company priced its IPO, there were debates about whether investors should value Rocket as a tech company or a mortgage originator. “On one hand, the value of their tech platform and ability to disrupt is significant,” writes Wells Fargo analysts Donald Fandetti, Michael Kaye, and Steven DeBartolo, who initiated coverage at the equivalent of Neutral with a price target of $29. “On the other hand, almost all of their revenue is from mortgage gain on sale which is volatile.” While analysts see the opportunity for Rocket, already the biggest player in the mortgage origination game, to secure a greater share in a highly-fragmented market using its proprietary digital platform, that market itself is highly cyclical, which could cut into earnings when sky-high refinance volumes return to earth. In its preliminary report, the company attributed its second-quarter growth in earnings to increased demand for mortgages and capacity constraints in the industry, which drove a 5.19% gain on sale margin, up from 3.22% over the same period in 2019. Looking farther ahead, analysts expect earnings per share of $3.16 for 2020 and $1.46 for 2021 according to FactSet, as capacity constraints decrease and Rocket’s currently elevated gain on sale margin falls. The second quarter “represented almost the perfect confluence of events” for an elevated high gain on sale margin, JP Morgan analysts write, citing falling rates, originator capacity constraints due to the surge in volume, and heightened demand for mortgage-backed securities due to Federal Reserve actions. “While we would normally expect [gain on sale margins] to remain between 3 and 4%, RKT generated a blended gain on sale of [5.19%], a level that is unlikely to be repeated within our modeled horizon.” “Origination volumes and margins are difficult to forecast given dependence on rates and competitor behavior,” writes a team of analysts led by Jason Kupferberg at BofA, who initiated at Buy with a $32 price target. Investors saw this sensitivity to rates play out in mid-August after government-sponsored entities Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac announced a 50 basis-point fee on refinances. Rocket shares fell 6.3% on the news, which critics warned would stymie refinance volume in the long-term and compel originators to cover the fee for locked-in borrowers in the short-term. The implementation of that fee has since been delayed until December. Even as analysts worry about Rocket’s exposure to mortgage rates, they see the company’s tech platform as well-positioned for growth. Rocket Mortgage’s first-quarter market share of the mortgage industrywas 9.2%, according to documents filed with the SEC, which the company aims to grow to 25% in 10 years, CEO Jay Farner said previously. “The biggest question mark in our model is how RKT deploys the significant amounts of capital generated in the coming quarters,” write a team of Barclays analysts led by Mark C. DeVries, indicating that the company is likely to reinvest a portion of returns into building its tech platform. Barclays initiated coverage at Neutral with a price target of $25. “Management suggested that there were some smaller opportunities on the horizon from an M&A perspective, and we get the sense that potential deals would focus on the real estate technology market over origination sensitive opportunities.” Analysts see the expansion of this program as key in the growth of market share. “Although a lower margin business, Partner Network volumes represent attractive business for Rocket as it brings additional customers into the servicing portfolio, where Rocket will have a chance to recapture future refinances on the mortgage,” the Barclays team wrote. A team of BofA analysts led by Jason Kupferberg also sees an expansion of Rocket’s partner network as a boon for growth. The analysts, who rate RKT shares a Buy with a price target of $32, noted that, while the partner network generates lower gain-on-sale margins, client acquisition costs are also lower. The company’s press release announcing preliminary results did not report direct-to-consumer and partner network segments separately, so Wednesday’s report will be the first look at both segments’ second-quarter performance. It’s a great time to be a mortgage originator with Rocket’s business model. The housing market’s recovery has seen demand for purchase mortgages and refinance loans remain elevated above 2019 levels for months. While some originators may struggle to match recent surging demand, Rocket is able to scale because of its tech platform, analysts say. “We believe RKT’s tech platform allows them to seamlessly handle spikes in volume, where many peer banks hit a capacity ceiling,” Wells Fargo analysts wrote. Rocket’s digital model also allows it to take advantage of another trend in the market, analysts write: digital-first millennials. “Rocket is well-positioned to take advantage of favorable demographic trends as millennials enter peak home purchasing age and expect a digital mortgage process,” write a team of J.P. Morgan analysts led by Richard Shane who initiated coverage at Neutral with a price target of $31. The surge of millennials in the market is one of two catalysts for short-term growth, wrote a RBC team led by Daniel R. Perlin who rate the company’s shares Outperform with a price target of $32. “U.S. demographics are on Rocket’s side, as millennials represent ~40% of new home buyers and rely heavily on technology for the buying process,” they wrote. That’s not the only demographic Rocket could cater to. RBC identified another near-term catalyst for the stock: nearly $11 trillion in mortgage debt outstanding from current homeowners that would benefit from refinancing at lower rates.

    "text": "The spirits giant said it had taken a €1 billion ($1.19 billion) impairment charge, particularly relating to Absolut Vodka, as the result of the pandemic, which closed bars and restaurants around the world for several months. Full-year net profit fell 77% to €329 million as a result, while profit from recurring operations fell 13.7%, beating analysts’ expectations as cost control measures took effect. Fourth-quarter sales tumbled 36% to €1.2 billion, as the pandemic hit sales in travel retail as well as bars and restaurants. However, there were signs of improvement in India and China as well as “better than expected resilience” in store and supermarket sales in the U.S. and Europe. Pernod failed to offer any specific guidance but Chief Executive Alexandre Ricard expected “continued uncertainty and volatility,” warning that the virus would impact social gatherings in the months ahead and economic conditions would also be challenging. Ricard said: “We anticipate a prolonged downturn in travel retail but resilience of the off-trade in the USA and Europe and sequential improvement in China, India and the on-trade globally.” Looking ahead. “Given the slightly better earnings delivery and improving trading backdrop in China, Pernod remains our preferred spirits stock pick,” Citi analyst Simon Hales said, while also warning that the sector was at risk of consumers snubbing premium brands in an economic downturn. Hales said there were limited positives for the sector, preferring soft drinks and beer ahead of spirits. Pernod stock rose more than 3% in early trading and is now just 8.5% down year-to-date, as investors welcomed the earnings beat and trading improvement. The reopening of bars and restaurants around the world will certainly help, and the popularity of drinking at home should continue, but the recovery is likely to be gradual rather than V-shaped with much uncertainty ahead. The major market indexes keep going up, but the notion that the stock market might be too frothy for its own good continues to be downplayed. Copyright © 2020 MarketWatch, Inc. All rights reserved."

    "text": "Don’t lock them out: lock them in until you have a deal. Shutting out private equity bidders was a favored tactic during the heady days of the debt-fueled buyout boom in 2003. So it’s a strange one to resort to when times are tough and private capital should be welcome. The troubled provider of insurance and cruises to the over-50s rejected a recent 33 pence-a-share takeover offer from a consortium of two unnamed U.S. private equity groups, which it said was“unsolicited and highly conditional.” Instead, Saga has chosen to tap its shareholders – which includes dozens of retail investors – for £150 million ($201 million) in an equity raise to cope with its spiralling debts. As part of the plan, Sir Roger De Haan, the son of Saga’s founder Sidney, will return to the company’s board as chairman, replacing incumbent Patrick O’Sullivan. Saga prides itself on looking after its loyal customer base. However, many of those loyal customers are retail shareholders who ironically, as a result of Saga’s proposal, will be diluted by more than 40% compared with the 140% premium they would have been received from the spurned private equity bidders’ offer. Saga’s convoluted proposal has De Haan, who sold Saga for £1.35 billion in 2004,  investing £75.5 million to buy 324 million shares, or an average entry price of 23 pence a share, to give him a 17% stake. In addition, by underwriting a third of the £75 million placing he could invest a further £25 million at 15 pence, lowering his average entry price to 20 pence and increasing his stake to 25%. That could be enough to block any future bids for the company, which may be in need of further investment in the future. The cruise industry – among those hit hardest by the pandemic – doesn’t look like it will recover anytime soon. Private equity has abundant supplies of dry powder to inject into troubled companies. The same can’t be said for shareholders who will be expected to stump up more cash in coming months as many companies look to raise equity to cope with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on their operations, which has left many of them reliant on borrowing to meet expenses. On Tuesday, AA granted its potential bidders –  which include a joint offer from Centerbridge Partners Europe and TowerBrook Capital, as well as separate cash bids from Platinum Equity Advisors and Warburg Pincus International –  an extra four weeks to make an offer for the company. Now is the right time for Saga to learn from its ex-sibling. Shares of Tesla Inc. shot up into split-adjusted record territory Monday, as the lower price hasn’t changed the trajectory of the parabolic uptrend.

    "text": "A series of blockbuster deals drove corporate deal making to its strongest start of all time in the second half, as chief executives hit the acquisition trail again after sitting on the sidelines during the height of the pandemic. The combined value of megadeals announced so far during the second half of 2020 reached $256 billion, according to data from Refinitiv. That tally was only exceeded once in this period, in 2015. Nine deals worth $5 billion or more were announced in August alone — the biggest count for that month since 1999, dominated by the technology and health-care sectors. “A coalescence of deals on hold coming back to life, central banks providing copious amounts of cheap liquidity and companies seeking growth has led to an M&A [mergers and acquisitions] boom as deal makers have returned from pandemic enforced seclusion,” said Frank Aquila, global head of M&A at international law firm Sullivan & Cromwell. “Unless there is a significant economic shutdown in the coming months, M&A activity will likely remain at near record levels through at least the end of 2020 and likely well into 2021,” he added. Deals in the tech sector total $69.3 billion, accounting for 27% of global M&A activity during August. Six of the largest 10 deals announced globally during the month involved tech sector targets, while health-care deals total $38.5 billion, the highest monthly number since December 2019. The resurgence in deal making comes after the coronavirus halted a six-year M&A boom, as companies moved to preserve cash instead of pursuing big-ticket acquisitions. In April, dozens of companies worldwide drew down lines of credit, looking to bolster their cash piles as revenues collapsed amid the near-shut down of the economy. Activist investors also took a back seat at the height of the pandemic, as the tools that once boosted returns at target companies became impossible to use amid sinking valuations and the continuing massive government intervention in the world’s largest economies. Share prices have since recovered, spurring companies with strong balance sheets to target their more vulnerable rivals, but overall, activity is still down. During the first eight months of 2020, the value of global deal making reached $1.8 trillion, a 31% fall from the same period last year and the lowest year-to-date level since 2013, Refinitiv data shows. Asia-Pacific accounted for the highest share of year-to-date activity. On Aug. 31, French water and waste management group Veolia said that it had made an all-cash offer to acquire a 29.9% stake in its peer Suez from Engie, at a price of €15.50 ($18.46) a share. Suez issued a statement shortly after, saying Veolia’s approach “has been unsolicited and Suez had no discussion with Veolia about a possible merger.” It added that it has set up an ad hoc committee to examine the proposal. Last year, shareholder activist firm Amber Capital called for a strategy review at Suez, arguing that the French utility had underperformed rivals and could create more value for its shareholders.

    "text": "Apple Inc. shares  are up 1.7% in premarket trading Tuesday after J.P. Morgan analyst Samik Chatterjee raised his price target to $150 from a split-adjusted $115. Chatterjee wrote that \"investors have widely acknowledged the rich valuation\" of Apple's stock after the company became the first in the U.S. to notch a $2 trillion valuation in late August, but he still sees room to run for the shares. \"While the $2 trillion market cap valuation in itself is a significant milestone, that Apple shares crossed it in a year with significant COVID-19 disruption testifies to the recurring nature of not only its services, but also its products, such that investors are now willing to pay a services-like premium on the entire earnings stream and a modest premium on account of expectations for further revenue/earnings upside,\" Chatterjee said in a note to clients. Also on Tuesday, Bloomberg reported that Apple has asked its suppliers to build at least 75 million 5G iPhones in the coming months, which is similar to what the company asked for during its prior launch, a signal that Apple is seeing stability in its business despite the COVID-19 crisis. Apple shares have gained 60% over the past three months as the Dow Jones Industrial Average  has increased 12%.

    "text": "The thought must’ve crossed many investors’ minds during the pandemic. Why not just get out of the markets entirely and switch into cash? Fund management giant Vanguard Group looked at the investors who did exactly that, in a study recently published. Now, the Vanguard crowd isn’t exactly that of Robinhood—between Feb. 19 and May 31, only 5% of self-directed defined-contribution plan participants traded at all. The proportion was somewhat higher among retail self-directed households, with 17% making some trades during that time period. For both sets of investors, less than 0.5% of clients moved into all-cash portfolio, Vanguard said. The defined contribution cash panickers went from having 69% of their $105,000 portfolios in stocks at the end of 2019, and the retail cash panickers went from having 77% of their $70,000 portfolios in stocks. In both cases, these investors were typically in the mid-50s and held accounts for over a decade. About two-thirds of the defined contribution cash panickers were female; the retail cash panicker split was 46% male, 29% female and 25% a household of two or more members. Vanguard then went and compared the distributions of their actual realized returns to their personal pre-pandemic benchmark returns. At the end of March, the cash panickers had done better, with 56% of defined contribution and 58% of individual investors sporting better returns. That changed as the market rebounded. By the end of May, 84% of the defined contribution cash panickers had worse returns than their pre-pandemic portfolio, with 86% of retail cash panickers doing worse.

    "text": "With the U.S. economy grappling with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, investment advisers are seeing the ripple effects. Some clients fear losing everything they’ve built. For some, the threat of bankruptcy is a reality, while for others, even the remote possibility of going broke stirs feelings of dread. Advisers face a tricky challenge in aiding these anxious clients. On one hand, they have a responsibility to prepare individuals for the worst — and devise a plan if the money runs out. But in their effort to assist clients in desperate financial straits, they risk coming on too strong. Facing the likelihood of losing it all can prove immobilizing. Rushing to draft a detailed strategy and offer technical advice will backfire if a client isn’t ready to listen. First, an adviser needs to show concern and gather information. “Maybe the client is treading water with their anxiety,” said Meghaan Lurtz, a senior research associate at Kitces.com, which provides education and resources for financial planners. “Part of an adviser’s job is to be there while they tread” and serve as a sounding board. Advisers who set a supportive tone are better positioned to help clients grapple with their fear. Responding to anxiety with non-judgmental acceptance is a good first step. “It may be exhausting and stressful for advisers to deal with these clients,” Lurtz said. “But you still need to thank them for opening up to you. That makes them feel safe.” The next step is to try to learn more. To someone scared of losing their business, for example, say: “Tell me how things for you are going.” “Get to the heart of what the client is experiencing and what’s at the heart of their fear,” Lurtz said. “It may be they’re nervous about losing key employees to the virus or how long they can continue to pay them. Or it may be a decline in revenues and their P&L [profit and loss]. It may be about something else.” She urges advisers to make statements (“Tell me more about that”) rather than pose questions. That’s because clients are more apt to lower their guard and speak freely when responding to a neutrally worded prompt. “When we hear a question, our brain thinks there’s a right and wrong answer,” she said. “But people respond very differently to a statement. It cues the client that you really want to know, and solicits a richer type of response.” Advisers tend to draw conclusions from data analysis. If they think a client’s fear of losing it all is unfounded, they may trot out facts and figures as reassurance. Yet appealing to rationality when someone is not thinking clearly — and riddled with fear — carries risk. “Whether the fear is rational or irrational, it’s real in the client’s mind,” said Kim Bourne, a New York City-based certified financial planner. “So you have to get to the root cause, whatever is underlying that fear.” She cites the example of a client, a pre-retiree in his 60s, who feared a financial wipeout as the market tanked in mid-March. In reality, he held significant assets and faced no danger of bankruptcy. “He had the experience of poverty in his past, so he was afraid,” she said. “The fear of losing everything was lingering in his head.” Bourne dignified his fear. Instead of trying to appeal to his rational side by crunching the numbers, she sought to learn more about his feelings. “Tell me more about what it felt like when you didn’t have enough money,” she said. Then she asked, “What did you learn from those dark moments?” Then she asked: “How did that help you achieve your greatest financial accomplishments?” He came away with a restored sense of perspective, Bourne says, and his fear no longer plagues him as much. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is using its authority to implement a temporary eviction moratorium through the end of the year, the Trump administration said Tuesday evening. Unlike the federal moratorium included in the CARES Act that expired in late July, the CDC's moratorium will apply to all rental units nationwide, senior administration officials said. Renters will be eligible for the moratorium's protection if they received a stimulus check, and they must be able to prove that they made an effort to receive government assistance and that they could not afford rent.

    "text": "Sophisticated algorithms are being used by one of Europe’s biggest movie theater chains to help with social distancing. Vue International, which has around 230 cinemas in the U.K., Germany, Taiwan, Italy, Poland and other European countries, has been using artificial intelligence to optimize screening times and is making adjustments to control the flow of audiences into auditoriums. Tim Richards, who founded privately owned Vue cinemas around 20 years ago, said 10 years’ worth of data had been fed in computers pre-COVID to decide on the timing and frequency for screening movies. This has now been adapted to control the flow of customers into the cinemas by staggering screening times. It is being linked with seating software that cocoons customers within their family bubbles, or on their own, a safe distance away from other customers. Richards, speaking at a press briefing on Monday evening, said: “It took me 17 years to build the group up to 230 cinemas. What happened just a few months ago was apocalyptic. “We have planned for crises such as a cinema being shut and blockbusters tanking, but not all the cinemas being down. Our big [cost] exposures are studios, people, and rent — we were quickly focused on our burn rate and liquidity.” Last month it was reported that Vue was lining up £100 million ($133 million) in additional debt financing. The firm is owned by Alberta Investment Management Corporation and pension fund Omers. Richards and other managers hold a 27% stake. Vue has been slowly reopening its cinemas around Europe over the past few weeks. “We have been using AI to help determine what is played, at what screen, and at which cinemas [to optimize revenues],” he said. “Our operating systems have been tweaked to social distance customers. It recognizes if you are with family and it will cocoon you. At the moment we are probably able to use 50% of cinemas’ capacities. “We can control the number of people in the foyer at any one time. Crowds would not be conducive to helping customers feel comfortable coming back. Every member of staff went through two days of safety training.” Richards said when he did reopen his movie theaters there was pent-up demand from customers but no new movies to screen. “We still managed at 50% run rate with classic movies that were not only already available on streaming services but on terrestrial television as well. People just wanted to get out of their homes and have some kind of normalcy.” Christopher Nolan’s complex thriller “Tenet” is the first major new film to be released and Richards said: “We are seeing ‘Tenet’ performing at the same levels as ‘Inception’ and ‘Interstellar’ did which has been amazing. “It will be a bumpy road in some areas but we expect a return to normalcy in six months — it will take a couple of months to get people comfortable again with their positions.” “Netflix has been disruptive for everything in the home,” he said. “We are out of the home, so Netflix is complementary to us because most people who like film like film on all formats. “I’ve seen the demise of the industry predicted definitely five or six times. We have been counter cyclical during downturns — we are reasonably priced so people come out and enjoy what we have to offer.” Rudy Giuliani offers his perspective to Fox News on rising concerns that the police disproportionately kill black Americans.

    "text": "The numbers: Private-sector companies added or regained 428,000 jobs in August, ADP said Wednesday, but the modest gain won’t dispel worries about a slowdown in hiring over the summer as the U.S. recovers from the coronavirus. Wall Street economists had forecast an increase of 1 million private-sector jobs, according to Econoday. See ADP report The increase in hiring last month topped a revised 212,000 increase in July, the giant payroll processor said. Initially ADP had reported that just 167,000 new jobs were created in that month. The economy has recouped fewer than half of the 20 million-plus jobs lost in the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic. What happened: Large companies boosted payrolls by 298,000, midsized companies by 79,000 and small companies by 52,000. Hiring rose the fastest in hotels, restaurants, retail, education, health care and professional businesses. The only segment of the economy to lose jobs again was information — media, public relations and the like. Big picture: The ADP report suggests the economic recovery ran into stiffer resistance for the second month in a row, but it’s not always a reliable bellwether. The report, for instance, has shown fewer new jobs created in each of the past four months than the government’s initial estimate. The Labor Department on Friday is likely to report the U.S. created 1.2 million new jobs in August, according to economists polled by MarketWatch. Yet what does seem clear from ADP and other employment barometers is that companies are bringing workers back more slowly compared to earlier in the summer. Or not at all. Some hard-hit industries such as travel and accommodation are even laying off employees again with federal aid drying up and most customers staying away.  That will make it even harder for the economy to return to normal. What they are saying?”The U.S. labor market recovery continued at a fairly sluggish pace in August,” said senior economist Andrew Grantham of CIBC Economics.

    "text": "It’s been no secret that China was among the first to emerge from the pandemic that is still ravaging much of the world — in part because it was the first to experience the crisis, but also because of its heavy-handed but effective lockdown. And compared with much of the world, China’s current conditions are exceptional, and it has been seen as the sort of sentinel in how to return, and how to gauge that return, to elements of normalcy. Schools are mostly back in session, the coronavirus is under control save for a few small pockets, and a steady stream of solid economic news has come in lately. China is likely to be the only country globally to see full-year 2020 economic growth. That being said, China’s National Bureau of Statistics reported on Monday that the manufacturing index fell, while the services reading rose a bit. The country has come an enormous way since January, when it locked down. Yet these measurements of normalcy are misleadingly narrow — they define “normal” in terms of select economic areas, low coronavirus numbers, and kids returning to school — all important metrics. But as China exerts its newfound superpower status, it finds itself grappling with the most challenges faced in years if not decades. Defined this way, things are far from normal. “In these days of the global pandemic, ‘normal’ is relative,” Karen Eggleston, director of Stanford University’s Asia health-policy program, told MarketWatch on Wednesday. Eggleston added: “China still faces numerous challenges, from handling the risks of reinfection, to making up for the foregone/delayed screening and care for non-COVID conditions, to quickly but carefully developing and testing vaccines and preparing for national deployment in an industry previously rocked by scandal, to trying to address the structural challenges underlying [the difficulty and expense of receiving medical care], and addressing disparities in lifecourse opportunities for healthy lives that leads to a more than 10-year differences in life expectancy across regions.” Thus, under the placid surface of China’s post-coronavirus return to life largely as it was, lies a slew of exceptions, setbacks and maneuverings that are both part of its escape from the pathogen’s grip as well as its ongoing rise as the world’s up-and-coming global power. China’s true unemployment rate may never be known given China’s opaque system — the latest reading by outside experts puts the number at 20% among recent graduates — the concentration-camp scandal and virus crisis in the Xinjiang region are roiling potentially millions of lives, border clashes with India and historically bad relations with the U.S. (aggravated by the pandemic) put it at loggerheads with two giant rivals, Beijing’s takeover of Hong Kong has upended many lives there, and the worst floods in decades are wreaking havoc across a quarter of the country. Last weekend, China implemented restrictive export rules for technology companies, which could complicate an order from the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump’s that ByteDance sell the American operations of its subsidiary TikTok by Sept. 15. The move mirrors the economic retaliations the countries have been lobbing since the trade war. Most observers are focused on the brighter day-to-day return to normal life. “From afar it looks a miserable year for all the reasons you cited, but relatively China appears to be doing better than many other countries that are still struggling with the pandemic,” said China expert  Bill Bishop, author of the Sinocism newsletter and a former MarketWatch executive. Susan Shirk, currently a professor at the School of Global Policy and Strategy at the University of California, San Diego, who previously served as deputy assistant secretary of state responsible for U.S. policy toward China, agreed, telling MarketWatch, “I believe that what people mean when they contrast China’s ‘return to normalcy’ to the situation in the U.S. and many other countries, is simply that people have returned to in-person work, school, shopping, dining, and even travel now that the virus has been controlled for the time being.  But of course, you are right that there are many features of pre-covid life that haven’t returned yet and the government is on high alert for any new outbreaks.” COVID didn’t cause all of China geopolitical and trade issues, its frayed relationships with more than a handful of countries. But it certainly exacerbated them. We might do well to rethink our definition of “return to normalcy.” Tanner Brown covers China for  MarketWatch and Barron’s. Copyright © 2020 MarketWatch, Inc.

    "text": "Wall Street is bracing for the possibility of inflation making an unlikely return next year. Expectations for heightened inflationary pressures  reflect the economic devastation wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic during the second-quarter of this year which resulted in several months of subdued inflation readings, but as these weaker months roll out of yearly inflation measures in the second half of next year, U.S. price levels could test and surpass the central bank’s target of 2%. The sharp hit to the U.S. economy this year would end up laying the foundation for higher inflation numbers, according to Guy LeBas, chief fixed income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott, in an interview. JP Morgan economists estimated there is a 70% chance of personal consumption expenditures exceeding 2%,  excluding volatile food and energy prices. But LeBas suggested investors shouldn’t get too carried away. “Right now, we’re in the greatest dis-inflationary impulse we’ve seen in a decade,” he said. And many economists see this kind of so-called base effect as more of a statistical quirk rather than a long-term, structural increase in inflation that some have warned against. Market-based measures of inflation risks have returned back to pre-pandemic levels, in part due to the Federal Reserve’s announcement last week that it would aim for an average inflation rate of 2%. If markets are right, it will give the Fed the opportunity to show how the central bank’s new average inflation targeting regime works. Under the  policy, the Fed would not respond  to temporary overshoots of the inflation target with interest rate hikes to make up for periods when price pressures were muted. “If inflation does rebound, the Fed needs to put their money where their mouth is,” Tom Graff, head of fixed income at Brown Advisory, told MarketWatch. It was important that when inflation did return to 2%, the Fed needed to push back against any expectations for it to promptly raise interest rates in a public manner to convince the market it would adhere to its new policy approach. “Otherwise, this will all be for naught,” said Graff.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/as-schools-reopen-amid-covid-19-pandemic-how-long-do-asymptomatic-children-remain-contagious-11599043219?mod=home-page",
    "text": "A new study published in JAMA Pediatrics suggests that children can shed SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, even if they never develop symptoms or even for long after symptoms have cleared. It found a significant variation in how long children continued to shed virus through their respiratory tract and, therefore, could potentially remain infectious. While the virus was detectable for an average of about 2.5 weeks in the entire group, a significant portion of the children —about a fifth of the asymptomatic patients and about half of the symptomatic ones — were still shedding virus at three weeks. The researchers also found that the duration of COVID-19 symptoms also varied widely, from three days to nearly three weeks. A recent systematic review estimated that 16% of children with SARS-CoV-2 infection are asymptomatic, but evidence suggests that as many as 45% of pediatric infections are asymptomatic, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The signs and symptoms of COVID-19 in children are similar to other infections and noninfectious processes, including influenza. While children infected with SARS-CoV-2 are less likely than adults to develop severe illness or complications, they are still at risk of becoming ill. “Recent COVID-19 hospitalization surveillance data shows that the rate of hospitalization among children is low (8 per 100,000 population) compared with that in adults (164.5 per 100,000 population),” the CDC said. Such research comes at an important time for families and communities. Amid pressure from the teachers union to delay the start of the school year, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Tuesday that in-person classes will be pushed back until Sept. 21, 11 days later than planned. Remote learning, also originally slated to start on Sept. 10, will now commence on Sept. 16. Other countries have not fared so well with school reopenings. Israel, which also reopened schools this week, had less success when it reopened schools on May 17 amid high temperatures that made it difficult for students to wear masks, full classrooms that made social distancing near-impossible and, perhaps, the illusion that the virus had been vanquished, creating a false sense of security. The risk, as Israel discovered, is providing an environment where children unwittingly spread the virus to each other, which can lead to community transmission. That’s particularly worrying for those who have underlying conditions and the elderly who are more vulnerable to the most severe effects of the virus. Community transmission also makes contact tracing more difficult. A school outbreak can lead to community, hence staggered school reopenings, social distancing and reduced class sizes. “If we find a certain number of symptomatic people testing positive, we expect the same number of asymptomatic carriers that are much more difficult to identify and isolate,” said Enrico Lavezzo, a professor in the University of Padua’s department of molecular medicine. The latest study in the peer-reviewed JAMA Pediatrics focused on 91 pediatric patients at 22 hospitals in South Korea. “Unlike in the American health system, those who test positive for COVID-19 in South Korea stay at the hospital until they clear their infections even if they aren’t symptomatic,” said Roberta DeBiasi, chief of the Division of Infectious Disease at the Children’s Hospital in Washington, D.C. The patients here were identified for testing through contact tracing or developing symptoms. About 22% never developed symptoms, 20% were initially asymptomatic but developed symptoms later, and 58% were symptomatic at their initial test. The hospital staff tested them every three days on average, providing a picture of how long viral shedding continues over many weeks. Among the important findings from the study: Children, a group widely thought to develop mostly mild disease that quickly passes, can shed virus for weeks, DeBiasi and Meghan Delaney, chief of the Division of Pathology and Lab Medicine at the Children’s National Hospital in Washington, D.C., wrote in a commentary piece to accompany the study in JAMA Pediatrics. Other key points: Even asymptomatic children continued to shed coronavirus after testing positive, making them potential key vectors. In this study at least, there were a large number of asymptomatic patients: About one-fifth of the group in South Korean hospitals. They said the study provides important insight on the role children might play in the spread of COVID-19. But the study also has obvious limitations. One of these relates the link between testing and transmission. A “positive” or “negative” result may not necessarily mean that a child is infectious, “with some positives reflecting bits of genetic material that may not be able to make someone sick,” or, on the other hand, “negatives reflecting low levels of virus that may still be infectious.” They may have tested different parts of the respiratory tract and different testers may yield different results. It’s unclear whether symptomatic children shed different quantities of virus than symptomatic patients. They tested for the active virus – not antibodies – excluding those who may have had and cleared an asymptomatic or mild infection, an important factor for understanding herd immunity. However, DeBiasi said studies such as these can add to the knowledge of public-health efforts being developed and refined to bring COVID-19 under control. “Each of these pieces of information that we, our collaborators and other scientists around the world are working to gather is critical for developing policies that will slow the rate of viral transmission in our community,” she said. As of late Wednesday, COVID-19 has infected 25,773,958 people worldwide, which mostly does not account for asymptomatic cases, and killed 857,552. The U.S. still has the world’s highest number of COVID-19 cases (6,075,652), followed by Brazil (950,931), India (3,769,523) and Russia (1,001,965), according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University. In the meantime, cases keep rising in the U.S. with California becoming the first state in the country to surpass 700,000 confirmed cases; infections there hit 715,617 as of Tuesday with 13,150 COVID-related deaths.

    "title": "Moving? What you should know about doing it in a pandemic",
    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-to-move-in-a-pandemic-2020-09-02?mod=home-page",
    "text": "This article is reprinted by permission from NerdWallet. Moving is stressful enough without throwing a pandemic into the mix. Many Americans may be forced to consider moving as some federal foreclosure and eviction moratoriums have expired. In the first week of July, 32% of Americans did not make a full, on-time housing payment, according to a nationally representative survey by the website Apartment List. Others may relocate to save money, be closer to loved ones or simply leave a densely populated area. If you’re considering moving, here’s what to know from a financial standpoint, as well as tips to make moving day safer. Aside from the usual expenses like buying boxes, renting a van or hiring movers, plan for extra costs because of the pandemic. You may need to buy heavy-duty supplies to deep-clean your old place, for example, or to sanitize your new accommodations. If you are moving out of a rental unit, some landlords may ask you to pay for professional cleaners or take the cost out of your security deposit. The Big Move: I work in Silicon Valley, but my job is now remote. I can finally live somewhere cheaper. Where should I go? Moving across county or state lines? Check what the quarantine requirements are in your new location, says Jean Wilczynski, a certified financial planner and senior wealth adviser at Exencial Wealth Advisors in Old Lyme, Connecticut. You may have to pay for quarantine accommodations like a hotel or Airbnb if your new apartment or home is not move-in ready, she says. If you are receiving unemployment benefits, check the rules on how your benefits carry forward in your new location and what the taxes are if it is a new state, Wilczynski says. You can typically find this information on your state’s Department of Labor website, she says. If you are unemployed or your income has dropped as a result of the pandemic, you can also check whether you qualify for moving assistance by calling 211. You might not be able to really get to know your new place until you’re living there, so prepare yourself (and your wallet) for surprises like leaky faucets or broken appliances. Landlords and real-estate agents may offer only virtual tours. And if you can see the new accommodations in person, you may be required to sign a waiver, wear a mask and avoid touching anything while in the house. How to move safely depends on whether you are doing it yourself or using movers. Current guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that the main way the coronavirus spreads is through respiratory droplets, says Lindsay Slowiczek, pharmacist and drug content integrity manager at Healthline.com. That’s why wearing a mask and staying away from people is important to slow the spread of the virus, she says. Sanitizing surfaces is also an extra precaution worth taking. If you’re renting a moving truck, companies like U-Haul offer contactless pickup and drop-off options. Slowiczek suggests sanitizing the door handles, steering wheel, radio and the metal tongue on the seat belt in the rental van. Before picking a moving company, check its website or call and ask about its safety practices in response to the pandemic, Slowiczek says. Ask whether the movers wear masks and gloves during the move. On moving day, she suggests being prepared with a plan to limit interaction with movers and maintain social distancing. This includes packing as many things as you can yourself, or consider using a self-pack moving container as Slowiczek did for her own recent move. The Big Move: I’m tired of renting in Manhattan, but love living in New York. Is now the time to buy if the city is supposedly dead? If the movers will pack the truck, create a schedule for the movers. For example, ask them to start with a particular room as you stay in another. This is also particularly useful if you live with family members who are vulnerable or immunocompromised, she says. Try to limit their involvement with the move as much as possible. “Plan out the way [the movers] are going to move through the house,” says Slowiczek. “If possible, move all of [your boxes] to one area in your home so they don’t have to come throughout your house as much.” Keep hand sanitizer or soap handy during the move so that you and the movers can use it periodically, she says. (Check on the FDA website that your brand of hand sanitizer is methanol-free, Slowiczek adds). After the move, use disinfectants registered with the Environmental Protection Agency to clean surfaces or furniture. “Just using the product as-is is not enough — read the instructions on how long it should be wet on the surface,” Slowiczek says.

    "title": "Airlines are getting rid of flight change fees — but don’t expect air travel to get any cheaper",
    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/airlines-are-getting-rid-of-flight-change-fees-but-dont-expect-air-travel-to-get-any-cheaper-11598986778?mod=home-page",
    "text": "While multiple airlines have bid adieu to flight change fees permanently, travelers shouldn’t get their hopes up for fee-free flying in the near future. Almost all airlines have waived flight-change fees in some regard since the coronavirus pandemic became a major concern beginning in March. However, airlines have chosen to make the change permanent as the industry continues to struggle amid the pandemic. While the number of people traveling by air has increased substantially from the COVID-19-fueled lows in April and May, it still remains well below the norm. On Monday, over 711,000 passengers went through Transportation Security Administration checkpoints, the agency reported, which was two-thirds less than the 2.2 million people who went through U.S. airports a year ago. And with the peak summer travel season coming to an end, airlines are scrambling. “They’re seeing the writing on the wall and saying, ‘We could be facing some really empty flights this fall and winter,’” said Scott Keyes, founder and chief flight expert at travel website Scott’s Cheap Flights. By permanently doing away with the change fees, airlines are attempting to give travelers some peace of mind as they consider whether to make flight reservations during this still-uncertain time. If it’s still not advisable to travel come Thanksgiving or Christmas, travelers could simply switch to flights in 2021 without paying much more. “It takes away so much of the stress of booking a trip you know might not happen,” said Sara Rathner, credit cards and travel expert at personal-finance website NerdWallet. “Now, you can book a flight if you need to without feeling like you’ll be punished if you have to reschedule.” But consumers still need to read the fine print, even as airlines eliminate these fees. For starters, although consumers will no longer need to pay a fee if they change their flight reservation in some capacity with the airlines that have ushered in the new policy, they are still on the hook for any difference in fares. So if the new tickets cost more, you will be paying more. And if the new tickets cost less or you decide not to travel after all, you likely won’t be getting any sort of refund. “Free changes are not the same as free cancellations,” Keyes said. Many airlines have relaxed their rules regarding cancellations, allowing consumers to cancel their flights proactively. But passengers who do this in the vast majority of cases are being given vouchers for future travel rather than cash refunds. And those vouchers tend to come with expiration dates, meaning travelers must book new flights within a specified period of time or else they lose the money. While flight change fees weren’t necessarily the biggest driver of revenue for airlines, fees are still integral to their bottom lines. “Airlines have built their entire business model on fees,” said Christopher Elliott, chief advocacy officer at Elliot Advocacy, a nonprofit organization that supports consumers. “These are desperate airlines resorting to desperate measures.” Major airlines have copied this model, not only by offering “basic economy” tickets that replicate the budget-airline price point, but also by charging fees for extras like checked bags across the board. “People say they hate the fees,” Keyes said. “But what they really love more than low fees is low fares.” Given how critical fees are to airlines’ business model today, travel experts say that the unfortunate reality for travelers is that the future likely holds more fees and not fewer. “Just because airlines have eliminated change fees doesn’t mean we’re about to enter a new golden age of travel,” Rathner said. “Airlines will find a way to make up revenue because they need to stay in business,” she added. “We’ve already seen them lay off employees and cut routes. We may also see increased fares, or new fees get tacked on or rolled into the base fare.” In particular, airlines could use the past as inspiration: After the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11,  2001, some carriers began charging an additional security fee, Rathner said. “We might see fees that help cover the cost of enhanced cleaning procedure,” she said. And once the pandemic is over, experts said that airlines could very well reintroduce flight-change fees as people begin to travel more. To be eligible for protection, renters will need to provide proof of their inability to pay rent because of the pandemic.

    "title": "Why you might not know that Trump is threatening your Social Security",
    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-you-might-not-know-that-trump-is-threatening-your-social-security-2020-09-02?mod=home-page",
    "text": "One way U.S. voters are being played during this presidential election campaign is the deceitful manner in which key issues are being framed for their consumption. Arguably the biggest and most important of these concerns the so-called “third rail” of American politics: Social Security. President Donald Trump has vowed to kill funding for this critical, gargantuan program that nearly 70 million Americans depend on. What? You haven’t heard Trump say he wants to kill Social Security’s funding? Actually, you have. Trump says he wants to kill the payroll tax — which is how Social Security is funded. Perhaps like many Americans, you’re unaware of how Social Security is financed. It comes from payroll taxes that are paid by you and your employer. The past four years have convinced me that there are many other things that Trump’s supporters don’t seem to understand either (trade/tariffs, regulations, the stock market, etc.) but I digress. “If victorious on November 3rd,” the president said on Aug. 8th, “I plan to forgive these taxes and make permanent cuts to the payroll tax.” He then added: “I’m going to make them all permanent.” So when Trump talks of a “payroll tax cut,” you might think that sounds great. A tax cut! But this is deceptive election year politics, designed to take advantage of voter ignorance. Anyone in the media that’s going along with Trump’s framing of this as a mere tax cut is also being played. Trump seems to think that killing the payroll tax will save companies big bucks (His 2017 corporate tax cut wasn't enough?) while increasing the take home pay of American workers. Bigger take home pay? Tens of millions of Americans don’t have pay — period — thanks to the economic collapse brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. Important sidebar: Note that Trump said in late February, when the U.S. had just 15 coronavirus cases, that we would soon be down to none — proof, he said, that he was an effective leader. “When you have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that’s a pretty good job we’ve done,” Trump said at the time. Yet as of this writing, the U.S., with about 4% of the world’s population, has more than six million cases — one of every four on the planet. Not that this and other gross miscalculations and bumbling has stopped Trump from believing — and actually looking into — how he could be added to Mount Rushmore, alongside Presidents Lincoln, Washington, Jefferson and Theodore Roosevelt. It doesn’t get more delusional than this except, perhaps, for kooky Trump advisers like economist Stephen Moore, and even Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who has said that Social Security could always be paid for by moving trillions of dollars from the government’s “general fund to those trusts funds.” Trillions of dollars from the general fund?  What trillions of dollars? The federal deficit for fiscal year 2019 that ended last Sept. 30 was $984 billion. It has nearly quadrupled this year to a staggering $3.7 trillion, and this will skyrocket even further if another round of pandemic aid gets passed. These sums — so vast as to be nearly incomprehensible — get added on to the national debt, which as of last week was $26.6 trillion, up 33.6% on Trump’s watch. Remember: Trump said he would eliminate the entire national debt — not the deficit, the national debt itself — in eight years, because of all the brilliant trade deals he would do. Here we are four years later and things are worse, far worse, than ever. Other White House advisers, seeing the political damage this kind of talk has inflicted in a tough election race, have walked back plans to kill Social Security’s funding. And yet Trump’s words speak for themselves. All this loose talk is an insult to the tens of millions of Americans who are heavily dependent on Social Security (and Medicare too). “Heavily dependent” is not hyperbole. Consider some numbers: According to the Social Security Administration, the average monthly benefit for recipients this year is $1,503. As modest as this is, it represents just about everything — “90% or more” of all income received by “21% of married couples and about 45% of unmarried persons. It’s probably difficult for wealthy men like Trump, Mnuchin (who moonlights as the chief trustee of the Social Security Trust Fund) and others to see, but there is a vast sea of poverty in the United States. Click here to read a recent MarketWatch column I wrote about seniors and poverty. I’m talking about men and women — tens of millions of American workers — who paid into the system over their entire working lives. They deserve more respect than the Trump administration is showing them — and the assurance that the U.S. government will, without fail, honor the obligations it has made to them. Since Trump’s base skews older, it’s reasonable to assume that many of them, too, are overly dependent on Social Security. They, and everyone else, must understand that when the president talks about a payroll tax cut, it doesn’t mean what it seems. A retirement near the beach can be had for less than you might think.

    "title": "Traditional long-term care policies can still work",
    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/traditional-long-term-care-policies-can-still-work-2020-09-01?mod=home-page",
    "text": "I recently wrote that the market for long-term care insurance, which was growing rapidly 20 years ago, has shrunk dramatically. When the market boomed, insurers bet that over time policyholders would let their policies lapse. Instead, many more people who had long-term care insurance (which covers the cost of skilled care and assisted living or nursing home facilities) held on to their policies, and when they tapped into them to pay for care, insurers sometimes had to pay out benefits in the six-figure range. So, the companies jacked up prices and pushed regulators for aggressive rate increases for existing customers, while many insurers stopped writing new policies altogether. But there are still some good deals for people who want traditional long-term care policies. So, I contacted Brian Gordon, president of long-term care specialist MAGA Ltd. (Murray A. Gordon Associates, not Make America Great Again). The firm, which was started by his father Murray in 1975, is based in Bannockburn, Illinois. First of all, Gordon told me, there’s a myth that Medicare covers long-term care expenses; it covers only the limited costs of recovery from acute medical conditions, like a stroke. For the rest, you’re on your own. “We’ve always told our clients to anticipate Medicare doing nothing,” he said. Medicaid does pay for long-term care, but you’ll have to spend down your own assets before you qualify, and the quality of care can leave a lot to be desired. If you’re rich, on the other hand, you can pay out of pocket. “I’ve got clients today who can buy a nursing facility. They can live there by themselves and they would still have plenty of money left,” Gordon said. Long-term care insurance is best, he told me, for people with net assets of $500,000 and up. They can’t afford to pay the entire cost of an extended nursing home stay, and long-term care insurance could help them cover their care while preserving assets to leave to their heirs. How much coverage should you look for? “Most people we work with are looking to cover anywhere from about 50% to about 75% of the cost of care,” he told me. “So, if the cost of care is, say, $10,000 a month, my clients are usually looking at between about $5,000 and about $7,500 a month in benefits.” Gordon says his clients range in age from the 40s to the 70s, although it’s harder for older people to buy long-term care policies and the premiums are much higher. “I would say somewhere in our early, mid-50s is usually a good time to buy it,” he said. How much should you pay at that time? “Our average premium on a traditional long-term care plan is probably a little bit over $3,000 a year,” he said. Gordon prepared several hypothetical quotes from a major insurer for Retirement Weekly. The premium for a 55-year-old male who buys a policy that pays $170 a day ($5,000 a month) for three years with a 3% inflation adjustment would be around $2,000 a year. A woman of the same age with the same benefits would pay $1,200 a year more. (Women live on average about five years longer than men do.) Add another year to the benefit period and the premium would be about $300 higher for the man and $700 for the woman. A shared plan for a 55-year-old female/male couple costs just over $4,200 annually for a three-year benefit period and a bit more than $5,000 for four years. That couple discount amounts to $1,000 for three years of coverage and $1,200 for four years. Big age differences between spouses make it more complicated, but in this case, you’d pay just under 20% less for a joint policy than you would for coverage of two individuals. Since women tend to be in long-term care on average 1.5 years longer than men do, a four-year benefits term makes sense for them while three years should suffice for most men. You might look for more coverage in states like Hawaii and Connecticut, where semiprivate rooms in nursing homes cost around $12,000 a month, double what they cost in Texas or Oklahoma. And though some legacy plans include inflation riders of 5%, these days paying for 3% annual inflation protection is standard. (In the five years ending in 2018, costs of long-term care rose from 2% to 3.6% annually, according to Genworth Financial.) But the best reason to buy long-term care insurance may not be financial. “It signals to the family that when our minds were good and we were healthy, we made the decision to buy this insurance,” said Gordon. “It basically tells the family it’s OK to bring in home health care and it’s OK to put them in a nursing facility.” How much is it worth to know you won’t be a burden on your loved ones when you can no longer take care of yourself? That’s the real question to ask yourself as you consider all the options to cover long-term care. Now the only thing I feel comfortable predicting with confidence is that my future will end up differently than I would have predicted, writes Chris Mamula. Copyright © 2020 MarketWatch, Inc.

    "text": "As Americans have been forced to stay at home for work, school and even visits to the doctor, shares of cloud-services providers have soared. But there’s something else going on that points to a long-term trend investors need to know about: a housing shortage outside cities, and a boom in  home renovation and improvement. But variety is the spice of life — and an excellent tool to cut risk in your investment portfolio and avoid missing out on opportunities. Of course, an excellent way to play the home construction/renovation trend is through exchange traded funds that focus on appropriate industries. So we looked to three U.S. construction and home improvement-related ETFs, combined their holdings and removed their duplicates for a list of stocks. Taking the three ETFs together and eliminating duplicate holdings, we are left with a group of 69 stocks, 42 of which have had double-digit returns this year. So here’s the entire list, sorted by how well the stocks have performed this year.

As always, if you are considering direct investments in any of the stocks listed here, you need to do your own homework to form an opinion of how well you expect the company to perform over the next several years. You can see that many of the best performers have gotten well ahead of the consensus price targets. Then again, there are 25 with majority “buy” ratings, and many are still expected by analysts to should double-digit gains over the next 12 months. The major market indexes keep going up, but the notion that the stock market might be too frothy for its own good continues to be downplayed.

In the second-quarter post-earnings call with analysts, Chief Executive Larry Culp said FCF would improve sequentially in the second-half of 2020, then turn positive in 2021. \"Unlike peers, GE continues to have no official guidance, which in our view implies difficulty seeing 3-6 months out, while debt maturities and options resets suggest GE does not see normal until '24.\" The stock has tumbled 43.3% year to date, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average  has slipped 0.2%.

    "text": "While the Manhattan real estate market is struggling to get back up to speed after the spring coronavirus shutdown, markets in Brooklyn and outside the city have come back strong. In August, new signed contracts were down 37.8% year-over-year for Manhattan condominiums and 26.2% for co-ops, according to a report Wednesday by Douglas Elliman. Despite the declines, numbers are on the rebound from April, when the market was all but shuttered because of the Covid-19 pandemic. “The market is slowly getting better,” said Steven James, president and CEO of Douglas Elliman New York City. “We’re definitely headed in the right direction, and I think we will continue to do so, as long as there’s no more new big negative news.” That’s a big “if,” however. Service cuts in the transit system, an increase in Covid-19 cases or another delay of the reopening of schools could keep buyers from coming back to the city, Mr. James noted. Deals in Manhattan are down across all price points, according to the report. For example, for condos priced between $4 million and $4.99 million, new signed contracts declined 53.3% in August compared to the same time last year. Contracts for condos between $5 million and $9.9 million were down 39.1%. At the same time, new listings in the borough are up. There was a 30.1% uptick in new condo listings compared to August 2019, with co-ops spiking 68.3%. Listings for luxury condos have fallen, however. The report found a 40% decline in listings priced between $4 million and $4.99 million and a nearly 26% drop in those priced between $5 million and $9.9 million. Meanwhile, in Brooklyn, the number of new signed contracts is up compared to last year. “Brooklyn has been very strong for the last two years,” Mr. James said, adding that buyers look there for both its value and its varied housing stock. Deals for condos were up 33.3% in August, according to the report. Co-ops saw a 181% jump, with 138 new signed contracts last month, compared to 49 in August 2019. Single-family homes spiked 156% year over year, with 128 new signed contracts in August compared to 50 last year. Markets outside the city are faring better, too. For example, new signed contracts in August on Long Island are up about 28.3% year over year for single-family homes and about 15% for condos, Elliman’s data showed. Elsewhere in the U.S. South Florida saw a flurry of activity in August, as well. New signed contracts for single-family homes in Broward County rose 135.6% year over year, according to a separate Elliman report also released Wednesday. In Palm Beach county, deals for single-family homes were up 83.6% in the same time period. Deals for condos in the Sunshine State were also up last month, compared with 2019. New signed contracts spiked 161.1% and 26.4%, respectively, in Broward and Palm Beach counties, the report found. Meanwhile, new signed contracts in Southern California have seen more modest rises, according to a third Elliman report released Wednesday. In Los Angeles County, signed contracts were up 7.5% in August for single-family homes and 8.5% for condos, compared to the same time last year, the report showed. In San Diego County, the rise was 14.5% for single-family homes and 10.1% for condos. COPYRIGHT © 2020 MANSION GLOBAL.

Maybe your idea of wood paneling is a fusty country retreat circa 1970, or your grandma’s living room walls. But today’s iterations are anything but dated. “Depending on the material and finish, wood paneling can add everything from warmth and texture to color and pattern to a space, said Elissa Morgante, co-founder and co-principal of Evanston, Illinois-basedMorgante Wilson Architects. “And it can be incorporated in nearly any design style, from traditional and elegant to modern and casual.” To add wall-to-wall chicness, follow these ideas from the design pros. “I am a huge fan of wood paneling. However, a little bit goes a long way. It adds depth and texture to a room setting, whether used on one accent wall, kitchen cabinets, or for an outdoor space—you can really get creative. “Using bold colors really helps update the look, keeping it modern and fresh. Wood paneling really makes a home feel custom, well-designed and beautiful. It is something that will always be on-trend, so I encourage my clients to incorporate it throughout their home. “I love it painted and usually use deep, rich colors like dark navy, black or forest green—or crisp white and even natural wood. “When it comes to the layout/shape, I prefer clean, straight lines and use both horizontal and vertical slabs. Vertical lines seem to be more popular lately; they give the illusion of more height in the room. However, horizontal wood paneling is still on trend for a more farmhouse or shiplap style home.: “For a fresh and eclectic take, add a vibrant patterned wallpaper within panel molding, creating a framed effect. It's also interesting to highlight the texture of wood panels by mixing in metal, mirrored or painted pieces for a mosaic effect. We often choose an enamel to create a luxe finish that pairs nicely with the inherent richness of wood paneling. “For many people, the idea of wood paneling calls to mind traditional, dark finishes, so using a lighter wood and finish color is a way to achieve a brighter, more modern look. Or, add drama with a deep, sophisticated hue, such as charcoal gray or navy—or emerald green if you are even more daring.” “There are so many ways to get creative using different patterns or panel shapes. An updated, contemporary approach we love is a horizontal layout with a metal reveal. “A powder room is the type of small ‘jewel box’ space where a special material like wood paneling can have a big impact.” “Wood paneling can add character to a home by making it look older and more well thought out. For a recent project at a large vacation house in Utah, in order to counterbalance the large glass hallways, we are adding wood paneling in large tray patterns and painting it a dark gray/black. This bold wall lends a depth of character that plain drywall would not. “In a Brentwood, Los Angeles, remodel of a Mid-Century Modern home, we are framing the door with paneling made of small, long slats, which also adds warmth to the room as well.” “Paneling is a very simple and cost-effective way to add dimension and visual interest to a space. Particularly on sparse, larger walls, paneling can help a room feel more polished without the need for art or additional décor. There are many types of paneling, but I prefer to use chair rails with simple Shaker-style millwork or full wood paneling in more rustic spaces. “If you’re working with original wood paneling, which is found in many homes from the 1960s and ’70s, contrasting it with very sharp, fresh furniture is important and will prevent the home from looking dated. Contrasting natural woods with materials like chrome, linen and glass keeps a space with original details feeling fresh. like eggshell for paneled walls. A touch of shine also helps accentuate the details, particularly on white walls. “Full wood paneling is great in a more rustic space or in barns or A-frame structures. I use pine. Staining is very important—I always bring furniture fabric swatches in during this step to ensure that the wood isn’t too red and complements the décor. “A narrow hallway is instantly made more charming with simple chair rails or Victorian paneling. I also love millwork in foyers with double-height ceilings. The paneling catches subtle shadows that help corridors or large walls feel more interesting.” “For a recent project for Noe Valley Townhouse in San Francisco (in collaboration with Staprans Design), we integrated a new central staircase to connect all levels of the home, which was formerly a multi-unit building. We used contrasting wood paneling as a defining feature of the stairwell to distinguish it as a focal point and create continuity across all four levels. “We also used a pattern of two-foot square panels. The larger scale created a bold, modern statement that envelops the central staircase ... By day, natural light floods this area and accentuates the varied grain patterns in each panel. By night, the cascading hand-blown pendants by Metro Lighting create a warm and atmospheric look. “The stained oak paneling had a natural look that complemented the bright and airy paint selections and tile used elsewhere in the home. To create even more visual richness in the stairwell and common areas on each floor, we mixed and adjusted the grain direction and tone of each panel.” COPYRIGHT © 2020 MANSION GLOBAL.

    "text": "Price: £2,999,999 (US$3.9 million) This five-bedroom apartment in Doulton House overlooks Chelsea Harbour in London and is part of the waterside Chelsea Creek development. When the building was in the early stages of construction, the owner worked with developer St. George (The Berkeley Group) and an architect to combine adjoining two- and three-bedroom apartments to create this 2,232-square-foot home. “It is the only five-bedroom lateral penthouse within the development,” listing agent Charlie Ince-Green said. More: London Townhouse Once Home to Famed Captain William Bligh Asks £2.5 Million   Chelsea Creek has proven very popular since it first launched a decade ago, he said, “with buyers drawn to the location and high-quality amenities alongside the homes.” This apartment is on the third floor of Doulton House, which was fully completed in 2017 and is “predominantly home to pieds-a-terre or buy-to-let investors,” he said. Interior designs of the penthouse, which has two balconies, are by th2designs, using a neutral palette with pops of color and plush textures throughout. The focal point of the penthouse is a large, open-plan living and dining room with eight floor-to-ceiling windows that bring in lots of natural light and offer views toward Chelsea Harbour and the creek to the River Thames, Mr. Ince-Green said. There is also a “lovely view over the development’s landscaped gardens.” More: Luxury Sales Are Spearheading U.K. Rebound “The entire development has a charming, sophisticated feel,” he said.

    "text": "A contemporary-style, 14,262-square-foot home in Sun Valley, Idaho, has sold for $18 million, making it one of the most expensive sales ever in the popular ski resort area, listing agents said. The sale closed last Friday after entering into a contract in the beginning of the month, according to Travis Jones of Engel & Volkers, who handled the listing with his colleague Svea Grover. Engel & Volkers took over the listing two years ago. But the property has been on the market with a $20 million asking price since July 2015, Mr. Jones said. “For this price point, it takes a while for the right buyer to come along,” Mr. Jones said. “Because of the Covid-19 pandemic, what the property offers-including solitude, privacy, lots of open space-matched what the high-end buyer is looking for.” He declined to disclose the identity of the seller or the buyer. Mansion Global could not independently confirm their identities, as property records were not available online. The home was built in 2011 by the local architectural firm Ruscitto Latham Blanton with designs by Todd-Avery Lenahan, president and chief creative officer of Wynn Design, the design team for Wynn Resorts projects, according to Mr. Jones. “This house has a cool, contemporary style, different from other large homes in the Sun Valley, which are normally log style and have more of a mountain feelling,” he said. Further, while the house has eight intimate bedrooms with 11 bathrooms, it was very much designed to promote family living and gathering with big, common spaces, Mr. Jones added. Outdoors, the 3.03-acre property has a pool with a hot tub, a gazebo, an outdoor fireplace, and other entertaining spaces. The property is minutes away from the Bigwood River, hiking trails, Sun Valley Ski Resort and downtown Ketchum, which has high-quality culinary and cultural offerings.

    "text": "NEW YORK, Sept. 2, 2020 -- The business telephone system, commonly referred to as a private branch exchange (PBX), predates the invention of the Internet, Ethernet and the personal computer.As such, legacy PBXs were always deployed on dedicated infrastructure. Read the full report: https://www.reportlinker.com/p05955428/?utm_source=PRN The call-control manager was a standalone hardware server or appliance serving as the bridge between the PSTN and hardwired extensions.Most PBXs functioned completely isolated from the rest of the business applications and infrastructure and were supported by dedicated telecommunications staff—either in-house or vendor-supplied technicians. Threats to these legacy PBXs consisted primarily of toll-fraud attempts that exploit poorly-configured systems to make expensive long-distance or international phone calls. The creation of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) brought with it a wealth of benefits. By leveraging VoIP, the phone system can leverage the same IP-network that PCs and business applications use. This not only reduces infrastructure costs, but also links multiple business locations across the wide area network (WAN) to bring employees \"on n et\" and eliminate the expense of internal communications. PSTN access also became VoIP-enabled, allowing session initiation protocol (SIP) trunk providers to deliver dial tone service to businesses without the need for dedicated PSTN lines or circuits. VoIP has ultimately enabled most of what many people take for granted, such as: video conferencing with customers across the Internet; home working for employees and call center agents; and mobile apps that make business extensions and calling features accessible on smartphones.Businesses have come to rely on VoIP-based, highly-connected communications and collaboration solutions to accelerate decision making, connect key stakeholders from across the globe, streamline workflows and improve the customers' experiences. Now more than ever, reliable business communications are mission-critical for any organization, which makes them an elevated target for cyber attacks. By gaining access to a business's communications tools, hackers can not only disrupt an organization's communications or rack up expensive phone charges similar to legacy PBXs, but also potentially eavesdrop on a company's meetings to glean proprietary information, collect call records that can identify customer information, or disrupt the work of employees.Business decision makers are increasingly driven to improve the customer experience and satisfaction, as well as create operational efficiencies within their organizations. Considering the disruptive nature that cyber attacks can have on the customer and employee experience, it is no surprise that security and reliability are top priorities when it comes to purchasing decisions.This research study calls to light several of the most common security threats that can impact both on-premises and cloud-based unified communications and collaboration tools, some steps customers can take to mitigate these threats, and a set of best practices for both businesses and their vendor/provider partners should adopt.

The masks will provide a local supply for distributors seeking to keep up with demand from hospitals and healthcare providers, manufacturers, retailers and others seeking to protect workers, customers and guests during the COVID-19 pandemic. Benchmark Shield is a spinoff of Benchmark Industrial Inc., a supplier of safety, packaging and warehouse essentials headquartered in Columbus, Ohio. They offer a broad selection of products, including the Shield™ line of hygiene, sanitizing and safety supplies, with same-day delivery in the Central Ohio area. They decided to create the new company to directly manufacture medical masks in order to meet the growing demand. Jim Reid, the President of both Benchmark Industrial and Benchmark Shield, said, \"Right now, having a domestic supply of PPE for people on the front lines is critical. Surgical masks, especially ASTM-rated masks, have been difficult to procure in the high quantities that will be needed to effectively fight the pandemic. Manufacturing the masks here using U.S.-sourced materials will ensure that we are able to provide a consistent supply of high-quality ASTM-rated masks for the people who need them most.\" Benchmark Shield will begin manufacturing masks in their new Columbus manufacturing facility in July. Sister companies in New York and Texas will provide additional manufacturing capacity, which will allow them to ramp up production to 12-15 million masks per month. Benchmark Shield is in the process of selling production capacity and taking preorders now from distributors seeking bulk purchases of ASTM Level 1 and Level 2 medical masks. Masks will also be available in consumer quantities through Benchmark Industrial. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other public health organizations have recommended that face masks be used by all people in public areas during the pandemic. Masks help to prevent the spread of respiratory particles that can carry the SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for the spread of COVID-19. Some studies have shown that wearing face masks can reduce the transmission rate for the virus by as much as 75%.

    "text": "SINGAPORE, Sept. 2, 2020 -- Kenon Holdings Ltd. (NYSE: KEN), (TASE: KEN) (\"Kenon\") announces its results for Q2 2020 and additional updates to its businesses. [1] EBITDA is a non-IFRS measure. See Exhibit 99.2 of Kenon's Form 6-K dated September 2, 2020 for the definition of OPC's EBITDA and a reconciliation to its net profit for the applicable period. Kenon's consolidated results of operations from its operating companies are essentially comprised of the consolidated results of OPC Energy Ltd. (\"OPC\"). The results of Qoros Automotive Co., Ltd. (\"Qoros\") (until we reduced our stake in Qoros to 12% on April 29, 2020) and ZIM Integrated Shipping Ltd. (\"ZIM\") are reflected under results from associates. See Exhibit 99.2 of Kenon's Form 6-K dated September 2, 2020 for summary Kenon consolidated financial information; summary OPC consolidated financial information; a reconciliation of OPC's EBITDA (which is a non-IFRS measure) to net profit; and summary operational and financial information of OPC and its subsidiaries. The following discussion of OPC's results of operations is based on OPC's consolidated financial statements, as translated into US dollars. OPC's revenue from the sale of electricity to private customers derives from electricity sold at the generation component tariffs, as published by the EA, with some discount. The weighted-average generation component tariff for 2020, as published by the EA in January 2020, is NIS 0.2678 per KW hour. In 2019, the weighted-average generation component tariff was NIS 0.2909 per KW hour. OPC's revenues from sale of steam are linked partly to the price of gas and partly to the Israeli Consumer Price Index (CPI). In Q2 2020, the System Administrator instructed OPC-Rotem to lower its dispatch. In order to supply the full amount of electricity to customers, OPC-Rotem purchased electricity from IEC at the price of OPC-Rotem's generation cost. As of June 30, 2020, OPC had cash and cash equivalents and short-term deposits of $145 million (including debt service reserves of $59 million), and total outstanding consolidated indebtedness of $736 million, consisting of $48 million of short-term indebtedness, including the current portion of long-term indebtedness, and $688 million of long-term indebtedness. All of OPC's debt is denominated in NIS. In July 2020, the Electricity Authority granted OPC-Hadera a generation license and a supply license with a capacity of 144MW, and the Hadera power plant began commercial operations. The licenses are for a period of 20 years, and can be extended by an additional 10 years. OPC-Hadera invested a total approximately NIS 0.9 billion (approximately $260 million) in the construction of the Hadera power plant (including the energy center). During the upcoming year, the Hadera power plant's EPC contractor is expected to replace or refurbish certain components of the Hadera power plant's gas turbines, over a cumulative period of approximately one month. During this period, the power plant is expected to operate on a partial basis. Tzomet Energy Ltd. (\"Tzomet\") is developing an open-cycle natural gas-fired power station with capacity of approximately 396 MW in Israel. As of June 30, 2020, OPC had invested an aggregate of NIS 470 million (approximately $136 million) in the Tzomet project. Due to the continued restrictions in Israel and worldwide as a result of the spread of COVID-19, and the need for teams and equipment from overseas, OPC estimates that the construction of the Tzomet power plant will be completed in the first quarter of 2023. In April 2020, OPC issued NIS 400 million (approximately $115 million) of debentures (Series B). Qoros sold approximately 2,400 cars in Q2 2020, compared to approximately 6,500 cars in Q2 2019. ZIM's revenue decreased by 5% in Q2 2020 to $795 million, as compared to $834 million in Q2 2019. ZIM carried approximately 641 thousand TEUs in Q2 2020, representing a 12% decrease as compared to Q2 2019, in which ZIM carried approximately 731 thousand TEUs. The average freight rate per TEU in Q2 2020 was $1,071 per TEU, as compared to $993 per TEU in Q2 2019, representing an 8% increase. ZIM's operating expenses decreased by 13% to $624 million in Q2 2020, as compared to $719 million in Q2 2019, primarily as a result of (i) a $38 million decrease in cargo handling expenses, (ii) a $30 million decrease in bunker expenses and (iii) a $25 million decrease in vessel lease expenses and slot purchases. ZIM's net profit was $25 million in Q2 2020, as compared to $5 million in Q2 2019. Kenon's net profit was $278 million in Q2 2020 largely as a result of gains following completion of the sale of half of its remaining interest in Qoros in April 2020. On August 8, 2020 Primus Green Energy Inc. (\"PGE\") sold substantially all of its assets to Bluescape Clean Fuels LLC for $1.6 million. As of June 30, 2020, Kenon's unconsolidated cash balance was $251 million. There is no material debt at the Kenon level. In September 2020, Kenon's Board approved a cash dividend of approximately $120 million, or $2.23 per share, subject to shareholder approval. Accordingly, Kenon will be convoking an extraordinary general meeting (\"EGM\") at which Kenon's shareholders will be asked to approve the distribution of the dividend to its shareholders. A notice of EGM will be published, and a proxy solicitation will be commenced, on or about September 22, 2020. The EGM will be held on or about October 21, 2020. Further information on the proposed dividend will be included in a Proxy and Information Statement. Following payment of the dividend, Kenon will retain cash of approximately $131 million. Kenon is the beneficiary of a four-year deferred payment agreement, effective December 28, 2017, reflecting deferred consideration from the sale of its Inkia power businesses, accruing 8% interest, payable in kind (total receivable as at June 30, 2020 including principal and accrued interest is $212 million). The deferred payment is subject to tax. Kenon is a holding company that operates dynamic, primarily growth-oriented businesses. The companies it owns, in whole or in part, are at various stages of development: For further information on Kenon's businesses, see Kenon's publicly available filings, which can be found on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.

Recent studies indicate over 50% of Americans believe their mental health has been negatively impacted by worry and stress due to the COVID-19 pandemic alone, not to mention racial injustice, the political climate, and natural disasters. In a response, Welleo Health has launched \"Wellness Reset\" — a mental health and personal growth virtual summit (appropriately held on World Mental Health Day - October 10, 2020).  The event aims to be part of the solution for employers and individuals who desire expert insight and science-based wellness. Too many of us feel intimidated when talking about mental health, and lack of resources or stigma keeps us from improving.  Wellness Reset is here to change that. Attendees have the flexibility to choose sessions they want to anonymously attend across three key themes: emotional, career, and relationship wellness.  All attendees receive 2-weeks of access to 17 hours of recorded sessions and for every pass sold, Welleo Health will donate a pass to a community mental health clinic or non-profit organization. We know that the increase in unaddressed personal wellness is an underlying risk to employee productivity, retention, motivation, and company culture.  \"There's never been a more empowering time for employers to inspire their most valuable assets. We are excited to partner with advocate employers that want to be part of the solution,\" states Dr. Ross Nelson, Clinical Psychologist and Founder of Welleo Health.

    "url": "https://www.prnewswire.com//news-releases/defense-innovation-unit-selects-google-cloud-to-help-us-military-health-system-with-predictive-cancer-diagnoses-301122642.html",
    "text": "MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. and WASHINGTON, Sept. 2, 2020 -- Google Cloud today announced that the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) has chosen Google Cloud to prototype an AI-enabled digital pathology solution at select DoD facilities. The project includes the delivery of augmented reality microscopes to DoD's medical facilities and access to artificial intelligence (AI) models that can help military doctors with cancer detection tasks on multiple disease areas. The early access to the digital pathology platform is for research use only. DIU is the organization exclusively focused within the Department of Defense (DoD) on scaling commercial technology across the DoD. The Veterans Affairs Center for Innovations in Quality, Effectiveness, and Safety recently reported that within the United States, an estimated 5% of outpatient diagnoses are conducted in error. This translates to misdiagnosis of 12 million patients each year.1 At the same time, the Defense Health Agency spends approximately $1.7 billion of its annual budget on cancer research, and that figure continues to grow. The goal of the DIU-Google Cloud project is to help improve the accuracy of diagnoses, assisting physicians who face an overwhelming volume of data when making diagnostic and treatment decisions--and to help lower overall healthcare costs. Working with DIU, Google Cloud will prototype the delivery of an augmented reality microscope that overlays AI-based information for doctors, providing pathology-based cancer detection tools at the point-of-care. Google's approach will leverage TensorFlow, an open-source framework to help deliver machine-learning models as well as the Google Cloud Healthcare API for data ingestion and de-identification to maximize patient privacy. The initial rollout will take place at select Defense Health Agency treatment facilities and Veteran's Affairs hospitals in the United States, with future plans to expand across the broader U.S. Military Health System. The AI-based models used to assist doctors as part of the prototype were developed from public and private datasets that were de-identified to remove personal health information and any personally identifiable information. All patient diagnostic data will solely be managed by the individual hospital or provider. \"To effectively treat cancer, speed and accuracy are critical,\" said Mike Daniels, vice president, Global Public Sector, Google Cloud. \"We are partnering with DIU to provide our machine learning and artificial intelligence technology to help frontline healthcare practitioners learn about capabilities that can improve the lives of our military men and women and their families.\" This is the second contract that Google has been awarded by DIU in the past three months. In May,  the two organizations announced an effort to detect, protect against, and respond to cyberthreats globally. Carahsoft Technology, as Google Cloud's government distributor, played a key role in facilitating this work. The DoD's Joint AI Center (JAIC) is providing funding for the project and technical expertise. The capabilities will also help support the JAIC's warfighter health AI product line that aims to improve the diagnostic capability of military medicine. About the Defense Innovation UnitThe Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) accelerates the adoption of commercial technology throughout the military and growing national security innovation base. DIU partners with organizations across the Department of Defense (DoD) to rapidly prototype, field, and scale advanced commercial solutions that address national security challenges. About Google CloudGoogle Cloud provides organizations with leading infrastructure, platform capabilities, and industry solutions. We deliver enterprise-grade cloud solutions that leverage Google's cutting-edge technology to help companies operate more efficiently and adapt to changing needs, giving customers a foundation for the future. Customers in more than 150 countries turn to Google Cloud as their trusted partner to solve their most critical business problems. 1 https://qualitysafety.bmj.com/content/23/9/727.full?sid=34b34ada-6159-4568-8b97-3a77d3db27ad Results Combining estimates from the three studies yielded a rate of outpatient diagnostic errors of 5.08%, or approximately 12 million US adults every year. Based upon previous work, we estimate that about half of these errors could potentially be harmful."

    "title": "75% More Women are Shopping for Boats Across the U.S., According to Boat Trader",
    "url": "https://www.prnewswire.com//news-releases/75-more-women-are-shopping-for-boats-across-the-us-according-to-boat-trader-301122968.html",
    "text": "MIAMI, Sept. 2, 2020 -- According to Boat Trader, America's largest online boating marketplace, there has been a tidal wave of women shopping for boats from coast-to-coast this summer. Reports of banner-year boat sales have been making national headlines and Boat Trader's latest data suggests the surge is partially due to women and mothers sequestered with kids, who have quickly directed their family and friends to the waterfront for some much-needed fun. In fact, the overall number of women visiting Boat Trader has increased +75% YoY across all age groups (18 - 24 years (+198%), 25 - 34 years (+71%), 35 - 44 years (+37%), 45 - 54 years (+55%), 55 - 64 years (+65%) and 65-plus years (+126%)). Historically, women have made up the largest niche market of boaters and filled a significant role in the decision-making process within their households, and their influence over the purchase of a boat only continues to evolve. Spurred by the pandemic, more women are getting involved at an earlier stage - researching and browsing boat inventory online - making the shift in female participation stand out in these unprecedented times. \"At Boat Trader, we're uniquely positioned to observe the market, and as we've watched this tremendous groundswell of boat sales happen, we sought to understand if a shift in consumer behavior was a secondary driver,\" said Courtney Chalmers, Boats Group's vice president of marketing. \"As interest in family-friendly and multipurpose boats continues to increase, there is a clear connection to the rise in female participation at the top of the funnel.\" Further evidence of this trend is the sustained traffic growth on Boat Trader by women beyond the peak of the boating season as travel plans and crowded events are still postponed. Given the fluctuating restrictions, unknown duration and lasting effects of the pandemic, women are embracing boating as a way for their families to safely connect with others and be active in the near-term. The 105% YoY increase in pontoon boat searches made by women indicates that versatility, ease of operation and ample space for seating are among their top desired features. And this participation is not fading after the initial research is done. Women are also showing a new level of engagement further down the funnel as they contact sellers for more information to evaluate boats for sale. In fact, leads submitted by women are up 341% over the same four-month period last year. \"This is a celebrated milestone for the boating industry, which, over the past decade has focused on increasing female participation,\" said Chalmers. \"As the gap between male and female participation in the boat-buying journey continues to narrow as more women lead the charge, the industry becomes better positioned for long-term health and closer to retiring the one-sided stereotype of boating.\" For more information about Boat Trader, visit www.boattrader.com, download the Boat Trader app, and find the brand on Facebook and Instagram. About Boat Trader Since 1991, Boat Trader has delivered more boat buyers to dealers, brokers and private party sellers than any other advertising source. Long before the world relied on Google, Boat Trader magazine was the go-to place to sell a boat. In 2008, the magazine successfully shifted its business model from print to digital media, and today Boat Trader reaches more than 10 million visitors per month. Designed to cater to consumer interest for boats under 40 feet, Boat Trader proudly displays over 100,000 boats for sale. To experience the marine industry's leading marketplace, visit www.boattrader.com, and also download the Boat Trader app for the latest way to search for boats on a mobile device.

    "url": "https://www.prnewswire.com//news-releases/prime-therapeutics-introduces-real-time-benefit-check-solution-with-drfirst-301122819.html",
    "text": "EAGAN, Minn., Sept. 2, 2020 -- Prime Therapeutics LLC (Prime) is rolling out Real Time Benefit Check starting with myBenefitCheck from health care technology pioneer DrFirst, giving health care providers comprehensive information so they can easily prescribe the most appropriate and cost-effective medications at the point of care. Real Time Benefit Check allows prescribers to answer patients' questions about drug coverage, aiming to streamline medication prescribing, and eliminate surprise costs for members at the pharmacy. This innovation is Prime's most recent offering to drive affordability for clients while seeking to improve member experience and outcomes. Real Time Benefit Check works through the ePrescribe function of a health care provider's electronic health record (EHR) system, delivering essential medication and benefits information within the prescribing workflow. The solution shows more than just a drug's price. Populated with an individual member's benefit data, the tool will alert prescribers when a chosen drug might add steps, time, and cost to the prescription filling process. The tool also displays lower-cost and therapeutically-equivalent alternatives to any chosen drug, as well as a breakdown of patient-specific costs based on the member's health plan formulary. In addition, Real Time Benefit Check shows if a drug requires prior authorization. This allows providers and patients to discuss options at the point of care and seeks to speed time to treatment, drive medication adherence, and deliver a more convenient, less time-consuming process for clinicians. Prime's Real Time Benefit Check offering was built on the foundation of a rigorous pilot using multiple vendors, including DrFirst. After testing for 14 months, processing 700,000 transactions among 25,000 prescribers, results showed an average annual savings of $692 for each prescription that was changed as a result of using the tool. One Blue Plan in the pilot realized a total estimated savings due to alternate drug choices of $348,000 from April 2019 to March 2020. This data supports the idea that increased prescriber engagement may generate significant prescription savings for the member and payer. \"Prime's Real Time Benefit Check is a game-changer for providers and patients,\" said Christine Bent, senior vice president and chief operating officer for Prime. \"Providers need efficiencies in their daily workflow and today's consumer expects real-time, personalized services in health care on par with other industries like retail or banking. Real Time Benefit Check is designed to get more affordable drugs approved faster, helping to reduce surprise costs and interruptions in care.\" Prime's Real Time Benefit Check will fulfill the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) rule requiring insurers that offer Medicare Part D health benefits to use an electronic drug cost and health benefit comparison tool that's compatible with at least one electronic health records (EHR) system, and goes a step further by applying it to commercial members. DrFirst was the first in the industry to provide price transparency to health care providers and has processed more than 100 million transactions to date. The company partners with more than 260 EHRs including the country's largest vendors. Together with its e-prescribing tools and pharmacy benefits management (PBM) integrations, DrFirst reaches 90% of covered lives to make price transparency available to providers nationwide. Prime contracts with additional vendors to provide coverage to other EHRs. \"With prescription drug prices rising at every turn, patients need price transparency and the ability to discuss options with their doctors during office visits,\" said G. Cameron Deemer, president of DrFirst. \"Providing this information based on individuals' health insurance benefits and formulary, in real-time at the point of care, allows patients to more fully participate in their health care decisions, so they are more likely to adhere to their treatment plans.\" DrFirst's myBenefitCheck is live with Prime's Real Time Benefit Check for select Blue Plans. Other Real Time Benefit Check integrations will be implemented in October for select Medicare Part D clients. A rollout to commercial clients will follow. About Prime TherapeuticsPrime Therapeutics LLC (Prime) makes health care work better by helping people get the medicine they need to feel better and live well. Prime provides total drug management solutions for health plans, employers, and government programs including Medicare and Medicaid. The company processes claims and offers clinical services for people with complex medical conditions. Prime serves more than 30 million people.

Through the lens of a typical FOTA flow, realizing FOTA needs E/E architecture disruption, and the support of new technologies like automotive Ethernet, cyber security, intelligent gateway, great computing power, and large memory.Conventional OEMs have made slow progress in FOTA development over the past several years. Yet they took a big step forward in 2019. It can be seen from the table below that there is a gap between main OEMs and Tesla. Success of Tesla Model 3 weighs so heavily on traditional automakers that they are highly endangered except sweating for rapid transformation.VW is the most aggressive among OEMs, while its counterparts are also working hard. The race to roll out intelligent gateway chip in early 2020 is a reflection of OEM's eager hoping to enable FOTA as early as possible just as Tesla has done.Installation of SOTA easier to realize is soaring in both volume and rate. In 2019, 3.838 million passenger cars, or 19% of the total, were provided with SOTA, jumping by 60.6% compared with 2.39 million units, or 11.8% of the total in 2018, according to the author.Among typical OEMs, GM leads in OTA capability. Its new-generation electronic architecture enables FOTA updates on its ICE models, which means OTA is available to recalibrate or upgrade engine and transmission control modules, vehicle communication system, entertainment system, driving control and body control ECU at a later stage.In 2020, Buick's latest interconnection system, eConnect3.0 enables OTA updates of 9 major models such as OnStar module, IVI system, intelligent driving control module, body control module, and iBooster brake booster.In 2020, the latest Cadillac CT5 model will pack GM's new electronic architecture. CT5 allows OTA updates of more than 30 vehicle control modules including software modules (e.g., IVI and smart connectivity) and firmware electronic modules (e.g., powertrain, chassis and electrical control).GM plans to apply its next-generation E/E architecture to most of its car lineups before 2023.Chinese companies that excel in application layer innovation already make plenty of OTA micro-innovations. Examples include SAIC providing personalized OTA -- DOTA, and BYD and XPENG Motors both offering high temperature disinfection capability enabled by OTA updates.In April 2020, BYD announced its new models like Tang added with high temperature disinfection capability enabled by OTA updates. This capability is not simple upgrade and introduction but involves a complete set of OTA-based working logic of multiple ECUs (e.g., multimedia, air-conditioner controller and PTC heater) in a safe way.

    "text": "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla., Sept. 2, 2020 -- Diagnostic Centers of America (DCA) and Boca Radiology Group has partnered with ScreenPoint Medical, Inc., to improve early detection and treatment using Transpara®, an AI solution that uses deep learning algorithms. ScreenPoint Medical, Inc. has developed Transpara®, the world's first dedicated breast AI decision support solution for 2D and 3D mammography. As part of their mission to provide patients with the highest quality imaging available through innovative technology, DCA has implemented Transpara® across their enterprise. \"When it comes to breast imaging, we are focused on helping to improve breast cancer survival rates by detecting cancers earlier. Our specialized breast radiologists are current leaders in this field. Transpara® will complement what they already do so well and keep us at the forefront of medical technology,\" says Steven Shullman, CEO of Diagnostic Centers of America. ScreenPoint has assembled a world-class team of researchers and engineers with extensive experience in breast imaging, machine learning, algorithm development, and clinical research. The team is highly motivated to develop technology that can make a difference in the early detection of breast cancer. Close collaboration with the radiologists from BRG and others around the world ensures superior performance of Transpara's detection algorithms. Boca Radiology Group's Dr. Matthew Saady says, \"My colleagues and I interpret tens of thousands of mammograms every year. We are committed to accuracy, consistency and reducing unnecessary recalls, which is a common cause of anxiety for women undergoing mammography. We recognize that each of our patients has a unique short-term and long-term risk of developing breast cancer. After reviewing the evidence about available AI solutions, we determined that Transpara® can best help us to identify those patients with short-term risk. Coupling that with factors such as breast density and family history, we can make the best decision about each patient screening that we review. Transpara® meets our clinical needs and fits seamlessly into the workflow of our busy screening practice.\" Steven Shullman adds, \"DCA regularly purchases what we consider to be best-in-class technology. That said, we work with a variety of modality and IT vendors. It was important that we select an AI partner who is committed to interfacing with multiple vendors to deliver a fast and efficient workflow for our physicians. ScreenPoint is working closely with us to do just that.\" \"The mission and core values of both DCA and Boca Radiology Group very much align with ours,\" said Nico Karssemeijer, ScreenPoint Medical Co-Founder and CEO. \"We are looking forward to working closely with these forward-thinking teams to advance our algorithm and bring the best possible care to the patients they serve.\" Founded in 1992, Diagnostic Centers of America (DCA) is a leading outpatient imaging center with eight locations in Palm Beach County, Florida.

    "text": "Oakland, Calif., Sept. 2, 2020 -- Jim Capobianco, of Ratatouille fame, is making a new stop-motion animation film about the life of Leonardo da Vinci. The Inventor will tell the story of Leonardo's time in the French court where he was free to unleash the full power of his incredible imagination, from flying machines to the human body, in a humorous and inventive story for the whole family. The movie, to be voiced by Stephen Fry and Star Wars actor Daisy Ridley, is being made completely independently and hit its initial $50,000 fundraising target in just 12 hours. Jim Capobianco, the writer and director of The Inventor, explained why he wanted to make the film independently. He said: \"We want to create a completely new way of making an animated feature film of this scale\". \"Our Kickstarter community is part of the film from the very beginning, joining forces with some of the best and most creative minds in the industry and allowing us to open access and truly share the process and the making of the film.\" \"We hope to inspire the next generation of animators and Leonardos of the 21st century.\" The project brings together the people who have been behind some of the greatest animated films of recent years including Isle of Dogs, The Nightmare Before Christmas, Song of The Sea, Fantastic Mr. Fox and The Lion King. The money raised so far will pay for 'The Animatic', this is the blueprint that guides all of the craftspeople who work on the film. Now Jim is inviting more film fans to sign up to The Inventor Kickstarter campaign so they can progress the next part of the project. Jim added: \"We are absolutely over the moon by the support we've received so far. Now we're inviting more people to join us so we can fund the music development, sound design and concept art. \"Leonardo's story very much resonates with the issues we face in our world today. He was the ultimate free thinker, who challenged the orthodoxy of his time. Stories like his can be inspiring and show us all a way forward.\" Supporters of the film will get a host of rewards including exclusive artwork, signed illustrated scripts, behind the scenes tours, animation masterclasses, exclusive film credits, and could even appear in the film.

    "text": "Trip provides people with best-in-class tools and practices for those undertaking consciousness expanding activities such as meditation, breathwork and more. NEW YORK, Sept. 2, 2020 -- Field Trip Psychedelics Inc. (\"Field Trip\" or the \"Company\"), the company redefining mental health and well-being through its ground-breaking work in psychedelics and psychedelic-enhanced psychotherapy, today announced the launch of its first-ever app, Trip. A first-of-its-kind app and experience, Trip allows people from anywhere in the world to access tools that support self-exploration and consciousness expansion through meditation, breathwork and more. Trip blends modern understandings of neuroscience and psychology with the wisdom of experienced practitioners in meditation, breathwork and self-exploration. It supports users with intention setting, mood tracking, guided journaling and integration and personalized music that has been scientifically designed to help guide you through emotions associated with different intentions. Available now on iPhone and Android, Trip assists self-guided consciousness explorers to expand their minds, break from everyday thinking and develop a deeper connection to their emotions and psyche. \"As we began building out our network for Field Trip Health centers across North America, we saw that there is a large population of people who were keen to start, or were already actively, working with consciousness expansion and emotional processing through meditation, breathwork and legal natural or medically prescribed products. But they were often doing so by themselves and without proper support or understanding of best practices,\" said Ronan Levy, Field Trip's Executive Chairman. \"So we decided to take the custom developed protocols that we were building for our Field Trip Health centers and make them available to a much broader audience. While Trip is not intended to be a substitute for properly supervised medical and psychological care, it leverages our best-in-class tools, and makes them available to anyone who may be working with consciousness-expanding practices.\" The user-friendly app allows users to start a 'trip' at the touch of a button and breaks the experience  into four stages: Preparation, Exploration, Reflection, and Integration. Each individual stage plays a crucial role in a user's journey and is designed to help the users start the working of emotional processing and integration of what they experience in their consciousness expansion efforts. The 'Preparation' stage helps users get centered and set an intention. The second stage, 'Exploration,' provides users with music that has been custom developed with LUCID, Inc. (a technology company that is developing AI-driven music experiences to support people's mental health) and gives users the ability to record their experiences through voice memos and automatically save those with timestamps so they are easy to revisit at any time after the trip. The third stage, 'Reflection,' guides users through a set of structured questions to share and reflect on key insights or emotions that may have emerged during a trip, encouraging the emotional processing to begin. Finally, the 'Integration' enables users to revisit their experiences, and develop insights by aggregating data from recent trips. The launch of the Trip app follows the recent opening of the company's first stateside clinics in New York City and Los Angeles, after it opened its first location in Toronto, Ontario earlier this year. For more information on the Trip app, visit https://www.tripapp.co/ About Field Trip Psychedelics Inc. Field Trip is the world's first mental wellness company at the forefront of the scientific re-emergence of psychedelics and psychedelic-enhanced therapies.

    "url": "https://www.prnewswire.com//news-releases/trade-raises-9-million-to-transform-the-nations-at-home-coffee-experience-301120623.html",
    "text": "NEW YORK, Sept. 2, 2020 -- Trade (www.drinktrade.com), the coffee subscription brand enabling consumers to unlock specialty coffee at home, is pleased to announce a $9 million financing round led by Madrona Venture Group with the continued support of original partners JAB and Launch. Trade is on a mission to inspire better brewing by connecting coffee drinkers to the best craft coffee roasters. Through Trade, customers are able to discover new coffee and support local at a national level while small, independent businesses are gaining access to new consumers nationwide. Since its launch in 2018, the coffee subscription brand has built a base of loyal subscribers with 90% retention after the first order and has seen explosive growth in recent months more than tripling subscribers. With the new funding, Trade will further articulate its brand story to reach a wider audience, develop roaster support tools, and deliver great coffee experiences, enabling the service to attract new customers and in turn continue to help roasters thrive. \"People are brewing at home more now than at any point in this century, yet the buying experience hasn't changed in decades. Our customers are passionate about good coffee, but struggle to find different brands and specialty coffees that meet their expectations for taste, quality and sourcing. Our brand and platform that connects coffee drinkers to roasters solves that problem. Through our curated selection, personalization technology and modern supply chain, Trade is opening specialty to a broader audience and will propel the category to capture a larger share of the $55B US coffee market,\" commented Mike Lackman, CEO of Trade. \"Madrona's marketplace and e-commerce expertise make them the perfect partner as we continue toward this vision.\" \"The specialty coffee market is highly fragmented, with amazing independent roasters all over the country serving local customers,\" said Scott Jacobson, Managing Director at Madrona Venture Group. \"While they roast great coffee, they have a hard time building their brand and scaling their business to reach a national audience. Trade helps them do just that, connecting roasters to customers across the U.S. who discover and delight in their product. We love marketplace businesses with strong value propositions to customers and suppliers, and are excited to partner with Trade to scale its marketplace for specialty coffee.\" Trade is at the intersection of two large and accelerating shifts in the American coffee market: the shift toward specialty coffee, and the shift to in-home consumption via brewing. In just two years, Trade has shipped more than one million bags of coffee; and the company expects to ship another million in the next six months. The additional order volume from Trade served as a lifeline to roasters when their retail operations and wholesale orders halted earlier this year and has now enabled many to resume growth. Will Shurtz, co-founder of Methodical Coffee of Greenville, SC says, \"COVID has not just impacted, but completely changed our business. Before COVID, 90% of our roasting business was bulk orders for cafes and restaurants. Since joining the platform in March, Trade has grown to about 30% of our roasted coffee business.\" Trade's 55+ roaster partners, spread across 38 states in the U.S., cite many other benefits to partnering with Trade, including operational efficiencies, a robust feedback loop to test and scale new coffees, and exposure to a broader audience. \"Top line numbers aside, being able to support the producers we work with, the importers, keeping our staff employed, keeping the roasters busy, buying from our non-coffee suppliers too; that's what's meant the most to us,\" says Trey Cobb, co-founder of Greater Goods Coffee Co. in Austin, TX. Aaron MacDougall of Broadsheet Coffee from Cambridge, MA echoes this sentiment: \"There are other, more substantial benefits to the relationship. Trade enables us to reach new customers across the country, which is helping us build our brand that extends beyond our locality.\" About TradeTrade (www.drinktrade.com) is the D-to-C coffee subscription startup that is redefining the home brewing experience. At Trade, we connect people to the best roasters in the country, enabling them to discover new coffee while supporting small business and better sourcing practices. Our team of seasoned coffee experts has curated a selection of over 400 coffees from 55+ local roasters that meet the highest standards for quality and ethical, sustainable sourcing. Our algorithm, powered by data from our coffee team, allows us to match users to coffee based on their preferences. All our coffee is roasted fresh to order and delivered to the customer's door. About MadronaMadrona (www.madrona.com) has been investing in early-stage technology companies since 1995. The firm invests predominately in seed and Series A rounds across the information technology spectrum, and in 2018 raised a fund to expand initial investments into acceleration stage companies.

    "url": "https://www.prnewswire.com//news-releases/brandwatchs-social-panels-allows-market-researchers-to-read-the-room-when-there-is-no-room-301122404.html",
    "text": "BRIGHTON, England, Sept. 2, 2020 -- Today Brandwatch, the digital consumer intelligence tech company, unveils its newest feature: Social Panels. This addition to the Consumer Research platform brings traditional panels and focus groups into the 21st century by allowing researchers to carefully craft panels and focus groups out of authors from the social web's most frequented platforms. Conventional, in-person market research can be inefficient, and amid a pandemic nearly impossible to conduct. Excessive amounts of time and money are exhausted gathering consumer insights that focus groups and panels yield, but even with those investments there are limitations. A lack of accessibility and geographic restrictions give global brands a very regional view of their consumers in a time when the world is more connected and globalized. Social Panels provides enhanced consumer insights at a fraction of the cost in real time. Social Panels is unique in its versatility. Panels are created two ways: These panels become more versatile, still, when you use them to filter social conversations within Consumer Research. Panels will reveal insights across subject matter by seeing how a defined audience discusses any given topic. Then researchers have the ability to benchmark panels against each other and then again against the general population. Lastly, there's the ability to analyze historical conversations within a panel - a practice that simply isn't possible with traditional market research. This flexibility isn't an option with live studies out in the field. \"We built Social Panels not only to provide robust, representative unprompted insight from social data, but to completely challenge the notion of traditional demographics,\" said Rebecca Carson, Chief Product Officer at Brandwatch. \"The modern consumer demands personalization, and to provide this we need to go way beyond segmenting populations with limiting labels like age, gender, and socioeconomic status. We need to understand what motivates a group of people, what drives their passions, and to discover their real, unprompted behaviour patterns.\" Social Panels goes beyond demographics as panels can be created with the most relevant individuals providing their unprompted thoughts and opinions.

    "text": "OTTAWA, ON, Sept. 2, 2020 - The Royal Canadian Mint is proud to launch a $2 circulation coin celebrating the 75th anniversary of the end of the Second World War and the Canadians who defeated enemies of freedom after six long years of service on the battlefield and on the home front. Symbolic of that heroic accomplishment, a \"V\" for Victory figures prominently on this new commemorative coin unveiled today on the Mint's YouTube channel. \"For nearly six years, Canadians serving in uniform or chipping in at home played a vital role in achieving a hard-won peace,\" said Lawrence MacAulay, Minister of Veterans Affairs and Associate Minister of National Defence. \"The Royal Canadian Mint's circulation coin issued on the 75th anniversary of the end of the Second World War is a fitting tribute to their legacy of bravery, of service, and of tremendous sacrifice. They have our enduring thanks, and I hope we can all live up to that legacy as this coin changes hands from one generation to the next.\" \"The Royal Canadian Mint's tradition of honouring our troops through coins goes all the way back to 1943, when Chief Engraver Thomas Shingles created the first Victory Nickel that called on all Canadians to work together to win the Second World War,\" said Marie Lemay, the Mint's President and CEO.  \"Today, that inspirational message has found a new home on a special $2 commemorative circulation coin that is a proud 75th anniversary salute to every Canadian who played a role in ending this historic conflict.\" The $2 circulation coin commemorating the 75th anniversary of the end of the Second World War is inspired by the 1943-45 Victory Nickels designed by Thomas Shingles. The \"V\" for Victory on the inner core of the new toonie was, at the time, a rallying call to support the war effort from coast to coast to coast. The letter is overlaid with a flaming torch and flanked by maple leaves over the dates 1945 and 2020. The words VICTORY and VICTOIRE appear on the outer ring, as does a message engraved in Morse code. \"We win when we work willingly\" and \"La bonne volonté est gage de victoire\" first appeared on wartime Victory Nickels. The obverse features the effigy of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, designed by Canadian artist Susanna Blunt in 2003. Limited to a mintage of three million coins, two million will feature colour. The new $2 coin is now entering general circulation. Canadians will find it in their change as bank branches and businesses replenish their inventories of $2 coins. Betty Bell (Royal Canadian Air Force, Women's Division, Air Woman Grade 1) \"I was in London, England, when victory was declared and the city erupted in one huge celebration.  The crowd danced and sang in the streets of Piccadilly and Trafalgar Square.  Servicemen were sitting on top of lamp posts above the cheering crowd.  Victory had been won at a price, but now Europe was free and the lights were on again.  No more blackout, no more bombs.\" John A. Commerford (Canadian Army, Artillery Gunner) \"I felt a great sense of relief and appreciation for still being alive.\" Carl Reiser (Royal Canadian Air Force, Flying Officer)  \"I was happy to be going home.\" The Mint is adding to this historic commemoration by offering related collector products.  There are 15,000 coloured and 5,000 uncoloured limited-edition special wrap rolls of 25 uncirculated coins each, retailing for $79.95. Customers may also purchase a collector keepsake set featuring both versions of the commemorative circulation coin, packaged with uncirculated versions of our 2020 classic circulation coins (5-cent to $1).  It retails for $22.95 and its mintage is set at 100,000.

    "title": "Rethinking Methane",
    "url": "https://www.prnewswire.com//news-releases/rethinking-methane-301122566.html",
    "text": "DAVIS, Calif., Sept. 2, 2020 -- Researchers from the University of California, Davis are rethinking methane and showing that climate neutrality is within reach for the California dairy sector. Methane (CH4) is a potent greenhouse gas that is 25-28 times stronger than carbon dioxide (CO2) — the primary greenhouse gas driving climate change in California — but how it influences actual warming is much different, according to a white paper released today by UC Davis professors Frank Mitloehner, Ph.D., and Ermias Kebreab, Ph.D., along with Michael Boccadoro, executive director of Dairy Cares. The publication, \"Methane, Cows, and Climate Change: California Dairy's Pathway to Climate Neutrality,\" examines recent literature from leading climate scientists and its implications for the California dairy sector. Methane is a short-lived climate pollutant and exists in our atmosphere for 12 years before it's broken down. This means, when a constant rate of methane is emitted for more than 12 years, one molecule in effect replaces a previously emitted molecule that has since been removed. In other words, methane isn't accumulating in the atmosphere. Currently, the main accounting method used for measuring the climate impacts of greenhouse gases does not describe how individual gases, such as methane warm — or cool — the climate over time. That oversight leads to a misinterpretation of methane's role in warming the climate, while also ignoring possible solutions that could offset greenhouse gases from other sectors such as transport. \"We have been looking at methane incorrectly when it comes to reducing warming,\" said Mitloehner, a professor and air quality specialist for Cooperative Extension in the Department of Animal Science at the University of California, Davis and head of the Clarity and Leadership for Environmental Awareness and Research (CLEAR) Center at UC Davis. \"While more potent than the most prevalent greenhouse gas carbon dioxide, methane is a short-lived climate pollutant, staying in our atmosphere for about 12 years before it's broken down and removed. On the other hand, carbon dioxide remains in our atmosphere for centuries, with new emissions accumulating on top of those previously emitted, making it the main driver of climate change.\" According to the white paper, which examined historic dairy production in that state, California dairy farms have already stabilized methane emissions, which is a critical step to achieving climate neutrality and global climate goals. The authors explain, that as dairies continue to achieve further methane emission reductions, then they can create negative warming, also referred to as \"cooling.\" California — the fifth-largest economy in the world — is responsible for about 1 percent of all global greenhouse gas emissions. More than 80 percent of California's greenhouse gas emissions come from fossil fuel uses such as the transportation (41 percent), industrial (23 percent) and power-generating (16 percent) sectors. Even though California is the United States' largest agricultural producer— producing fruits, vegetables, nuts, livestock, and other essential foods for much of the nation and the world — the agricultural sector's greenhouse gas contribution is roughly 8 percent of the state's total greenhouse gas emissions. Of this, California's largest-in-the-nation dairy sector accounts for 4 percent of the state's total greenhouse gas emissions. To its credit, the state has established goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent by 2030, 80 percent by 2050, as it works toward a goal of \"net-zero\" carbon emissions by 2045. Given greater efficiencies, plus a decrease in the number of cows and total milk production in recent years, the amount of methane emitted by California dairies is less today than it was in 2008. Simply put, California dairy farms are adding less methane today than they did 12 years ago, meaning more methane is being broken down than is being emitted into the atmosphere. California's dairy farmers are making further progress in reducing the amount of methane emissions released into the environment by installing anaerobic digesters designed to capture methane, or through other projects like compost pack barns and solid separators, which are designed to reduce methane production on farms. According to the California Department of Food and Agriculture, efforts to date will result in a 25-percent reduction of manure-related methane (below 2013 levels), as projects are implemented in the next few years. Continued progress in these areas will be necessary for the state's dairy production sector to reach the point at which they are no longer adding to global warming. This is known as climate neutrality. \"Reducing methane emissions and achieving climate neutrality is no small undertaking,\" said Kebreab, who holds the Sesnon Endowed Chair in Sustainable Animal Agriculture in the Department of Animal Science at the University of California, Davis. \"California is among the most efficient producers of milk and dairy products, and its life cycle carbon footprint (per gallon of milk produced) is among the lowest of any region in the world. Further reductions will be accelerated as dairy methane reduction projects are implemented and feed additives become widely available. For other dairy regions, a critical first step will be to achieve similar levels of production efficiency (more milk with fewer cows) to begin stabilizing methane emissions and work toward climate neutrality. The impact of such an accomplishment would have profound global climate effects.\" The white paper identifies methane as an important mitigation opportunity. As well, it follows research on notable differences among individual greenhouse gases and their impact on climate change by leading scientists at the Oxford Martin School and Environmental Change Institute at the University of Oxford.

For example, a sports rights holder such as an NFL team could target potential sponsors based on how likely their fans are to purchase a new car or switch mobile carriers within the next year. After identifying \"in-market\" consumers for products or services among its base, the rights holder can then use Nielsen Fan Insights data to build a compelling case for why they are an effective marketing vehicle for the brand. As globalization advances, Nielsen Fan Insights provides new ways of looking at the world and the sports fans who populate it. It shows the total sports fan population for the six newly added southeast Asian countries (Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam) amounts to nearly 210 million consumers. This massive addressable market represents significant opportunities for sponsors and brands to reach target audiences. Drilling into the data reveals these insights: The Nielsen Fan Insights platform is made possible by the unique combination of Nielsen's world class media measurement and sports industry media valuation and analysis capabilities. Through Nielsen Fan Insights, users can understand what fans are actually buying, watching and listening to across media sources and assess the effectiveness of sponsorship and fan engagement activities.

    "url": "https://www.prnewswire.com//news-releases/lucid-motors-proprietary-electric-drivetrain-technology-powers-record-setting-performance-and-industry-leading-efficiency-in-the-lucid-air-301122827.html",
    "text": "Lucid Air to launch with the most powerful and compact electric drive units ever, with a quarter-mile time of 9.9 seconds along with an estimated EPA range of up to 517 miles per charge NEWARK, Calif., Sept. 2, 2020 -- Lucid Motors, which seeks to set new standards for sustainable transportation with its advanced luxury EVs, today announced details of the proprietary, in-house developed electric drivetrain that will power the forthcoming pure-electric luxury Lucid Air and allow it to become the instant class leader in a number of key performance and efficiency metrics. With up to 1,080 horsepower available in a dual-motor, all-wheel-drive architecture, the Lucid Air is able to achieve quarter-mile times as low as 9.9 seconds on a consistent, repeatable basis. To date, it is the only electric sedan able to achieve a quarter-mile time under 10 seconds, all with an uncompromised package offering room for five passengers and class-leading interior and storage space. The power of the Lucid Air is complemented by an available extended-range capability that achieves an estimated EPA range of up to 517 miles on a single charge. \"Our watchword has been 'focus' since day one at Lucid – a focus on sound engineering principles, a focus on creating efficiencies, and a focus on maximizing power to create a world-class EV,\" said Peter Rawlinson, CEO and CTO, Lucid Motors. \"When the Lucid Air comes to market next spring, the world will see that we have developed the best electric vehicle technology possible by a wide margin and effectively created a new benchmark for EVs. The result is nothing short of a technological tour de force in every facet upon which a luxury performance car is measured.\" Lucid has been able to closely match its own computer-modeled predictions in real world testing by carefully engineering its proprietary technology with a focus on optimizing every aspect of the Air's performance and efficiency. Starting with the in-house development of the Air's drivetrain, Lucid created a line of powerful, compact, and ultra-efficient permanent magnet electric motors. Combining these motors with an inverter and an integrated transmission and differential creates a state of the art, 900V+ electric drive unit that weighs just 163lb (74kg) and is small enough to fit inside a standard airline carry-on roller bag. Each drive unit packs over 650hp, with a power density that is well beyond anything else offered on the EV market at 41hp per liter. This compactness allows for one, two, or even three units to be used to power a Lucid Air. In total, Lucid's drive units are 45 percent lighter and up to 59 percent more powerful than the closest competitor. For their power, the motors are two and a half times more volumetrically compact than the closest competitor. Also notable is the fact that the motors can spin up to 20,000 rpm, a significant performance advantage over the competition. The enablers of these outstanding electric motor characteristics include a set of inventions that are part of Lucid intellectual property. Most notably, an elegant and revolutionary new motor winding technology has been introduced to maximize power output and reduce electrical losses. The motor also features an innovative cooling system that more effectively removes heat from the stator winding, minimizing losses and boosting efficiency. The ultra-compactness of these electric drive units lays the foundation for Lucid's Space Concept vehicle design approach. This is achieved in part by the transmission and differential, which have been fully integrated for the first time in an electric motor – together, they comprise a single rotational system that is both lightweight and extremely efficient. Meanwhile, Lucid leverages a high voltage, silicon-carbide MOSFET system in its inverters to maximize efficiency, especially in real-world driving conditions. An ultra-high, 900V+ architecture combined with Lucid's Wunderbox onboard charging unit serve as the heart of the Air's electrical platform. The Wunderbox is a unique, multi-function unit, developed entirely in-house to ensure compatibility with, and the maximizing of, charging systems of differing voltages, specifically boost-voltage charging. It also allows the Lucid Air to charge at rates of up to 300 miles in 20 minutes and up to 20 miles in one minute when connected to a DC Fast Charging network (such as those offered by Lucid's charging partner, Electrify America, on its nationwide network). The Wunderbox also enables a wide array of future-ready, bi-directional power delivery features from the vehicle to the grid (V2G) for situations such as managing home power outages. It can also enable vehicle to vehicle charging (V2V). Lucid drew upon 10 years of experience and over 20 million miles of real-world testing in creating its compact 113kWh extended-range battery packs with integral race-proven technology and unsurpassed energy density. Atieva, Lucid's technology division, designed, developed, manufactures and has supplied the battery packs for the entire field of entries in the Formula E racing series since 2018 with an agreement continuing through 2022. The result is a battery system for Lucid Air that delivers unparalleled safety and race-proven performance in a form sculpted around the occupant cabin. The production version of the Lucid Air will debut in an online reveal on September 9, 2020. In addition to the vehicle's final interior and exterior designs, new details about production specifications, available configurations, and pricing information will also be shared. About Lucid Motors Lucid's mission is to inspire the adoption of sustainable transportation by creating the most captivating electric vehicles, centered around the human experience. The company's first car, the Lucid Air, is a state-of-the-art luxury sedan with a California-inspired design underpinned by race-proven technology. Featuring luxurious interior space in a mid-size exterior footprint, the Air will be capable of over 500 miles of range and 0-60 mph in under 2.5 seconds. Customer deliveries of the Lucid Air, which will be produced at Lucid's new factory in Casa Grande, Arizona, will begin in early 2021. http://www.lucidmotors.com"

    "text": "School community's guide outlines lessons from its journey to safeguard its community's health, offering a model for schools charting their respective COVID-19 approaches across the country. BROOKLYN, N.Y., Sept. 2, 2020 -- Brooklyn Laboratory Charter Schools (LAB) announced today the launch of its \"Brooklyn Laboratory Charter Schools Public School Facilities Planning in the Era of COVID-19\" Guide, presenting lessons from the school's journey to safeguard community health and offering resources for other schools to learn from its process, planning, and approach. COVID-19 has wreaked havoc on schools in America, leaving many educators struggling to understand and adapt to a new world of learning. LAB closed its middle and high school doors on March 13 before implementing a mix of remote learning and tiered supports to assist roughly 800 middle and high school scholars. In mid April, the school began planning for the 2020-2021 academic year, taking a deep dive into research on different strategies that safeguard health and support learning. LAB consulted experts in diverse fields ranging from health to design to education to equity, finally embarking on a reflection and discernment process to rebuild a learning environment that prioritizes and protects the safety, health, and well-being of everyone in the school community. In August, LAB reopened its doors. LAB, a public school in Downtown Brooklyn, serves students regardless of academic level, English language proficiency, or ability. The school has historically used a design framework to anchor its core approach to teaching and learning, seeking input from diverse stakeholders, fulfilling the needs of all learners, and collaborating with expert partners when necessary. In creating a master facilities plan for the era of COVID-19, LAB utilized all of these practices. Over the course of 16 weeks between April and August, LAB held more than 150 meetings, including a set of intensive working sessions, or charrettes, which served as safe zones to share hopes, fears, concerns, and ideas, and to encourage vulnerability. The school invited industry experts, government officials, architects, urban designers, educators, staff members, parents, scholars, and many others to attend. Key queries included: From these meetings emerged four documents designed to support schools to address COVID-related issues: the Back-to-School Facilities Tool Kit, the Instructional Program Scheduling Map, the Success Coaching Playbook, and the Back to School Learner Identity and Agency Guidebook, all housed under Brooklyn LAB's Equity by Design project—an initiative to engage students, families, teachers, and administrators to generate bold solutions and tools to the challenges presented by the pandemic. Through extensive research on school facilities modifications, LAB has honed specific practices and protocols for the new school year through feedback and insights since publishing these tools, developing a complete guide to support the needs of all learners. Topics covered include strategies for physical distancing, serving students with special needs, and facilitating learning despite disruptions to the new classroom space. These new approaches are categorized into four basic needs: \"We remain steadfast in our commitments to serving the highest need scholars and maximizing wellness and health,\" said LAB co-founder Eric Tucker. \"Right now, we believe the best way for us to deliver on these promises is to create an environment where learning can happen safely. In addition to applying these strategies at LAB, our goal has been to codify and share our findings so other schools can benefit from our strategic reopening process, planning, and approach.\" \"We recognize there is no one solution for every school from Brooklyn to Bakersfield, but we are committed to participating in practical conversations from which we can all learn,\" added LAB Chief Operating Officer Aaron Daly. \"As others follow this same path, we hope this guide becomes a resource and reference for all.\" As a founding partner of the Educating All Learners Alliance, a new coalition of disability, civil rights, and education focused organizations dedicated to educating all learners during the COVID-19 humanitarian disaster, LAB will distribute the Guide through the Alliance's network and beyond. Learn more at the Equity by Design website. Brooklyn Laboratory Charter Schools (LAB), founded in 2013, is a network of public charter schools that will serve 6-12th grade students this fall. LAB was designed to educate high-need urban students, particularly those who are least well-served by their current educational options. Named a \"Center of Excellence\" for its work with Students with Disabilities by the National Center for Special Education in Charter Schools, LAB aims to meet the individual needs of each student and to leverage innovative technologies and learning practices to eradicate the achievement gap. LAB was selected as an XQ school and is actively involved in work to upgrade and rethink high school to better meet the needs of students and of the future.

    "url": "https://www.prnewswire.com//news-releases/varo-puts-100m-in-pockets-of-hardworking-americans-301122507.html",
    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 2, 2020 -- Varo Money, Inc., the first consumer fintech in US history to become a national bank, today announced it has saved its customers more than $100 million in overdraft fees during the past year* and remains committed to supporting hardworking Americans as the country waits for an economic reset. At a time when Americans are facing severe hardships resulting from the pandemic and economic crisis, every penny counts. Yet none of America's 10 largest banks has reduced or waived its overdraft fees.  According to the Center for Responsible Lending, the largest US banks took $11.7 billion in overdraft fees from the accounts of American consumers in 2019. With the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, more American households are experiencing cash flow volatility and financial insecurity - meaning at a time when consumers can least afford it, big banks are likely to earn even more from these fees this year. Through its partnership with The Bancorp Bank, Varo continues to provide significant savings to Americans with its industry-first No-Fee Overdraft (NFO). It allows qualified customers to overdraw their bank account up to $50** with no fees. Three-quarters of Americans support suspending overdraft fees during the COVID crisis. Varo knows these practices are harmful to the financial health of consumers and is leading the way with innovative banking services to help everyone make the most of their money. \"I instantly fell headfirst for Varo,\" said Varo customer Brianna. \"I love everything about the services Varo provides, especially getting my work check two days early and being able to overdraft at no fee! Varo has changed my life and perspective on online banking.\"*** \"Fees, such as overdraft, are often charged to consumers who can least afford them, a model that Varo is fundamentally opposed to,\" said Colin Walsh, founder and CEO of Varo Money. \"Over the past year, Varo customers have been able to benefit from our No-Fee Overdraft - offering a short-term bridge to help our customers stretch their finances to the next paycheck.  It's a clear example of our vision for a better way to bank for everyone.\" Overdraft fees are particularly harmful to the financial health of the consumer. The average amount an account is overdrawn is only $20 for three days, yet the average overdraft fee is $35. What's more, banks may also charge multiple overdraft fees per day, leading to compound fees that can add up to hundreds of dollars. \"Overdraft fees often cover the costs of offering \"free checking.\" This typically means that the people who can least afford it are subsidizing banking for everyone else,\" said Mariel Beasley, co-founder of the Common Cents Lab. \"We need financial products that can still give households quick and easy access to small dollar credit, but in a way that is more fair, more equitable, and without the punishing price-tag.\" With no near-term economic recovery in sight, consumers are actively looking for ways to stretch their money further. Switching to a digital bank can help them avoid punitive fees. Beyond NFO, Varo offers premium banking that's wholly centered on improving customers' financial health, including paying meaningful interest on savings accounts and auto-savings tools that make it easy to build financial resilience. About VaroVaro is on a mission to help people become more financially resilient. Through its mobile app, Varo offers customers premium bank accounts that have no minimum balance requirement or monthly account fee, high-interest savings accounts, and tech-first features to help people save and manage their money more easily. Varo is the first consumer fintech to be granted a national bank charter by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. For more information, visit www.varomoney.com, like Varo on Facebook, and follow us on Instagram and Twitter @varomoney. Bank account services provided by The Bancorp Bank; Member FDIC. *Overdraft fee savings calculated by: Frequency of Varo customers overdrawing account with No Fee Overdraft from August 2019 through August 2020 multiplied by average overdraft fee. **Meet both of these requirements to qualify: Make at least five qualifying Varo Visa® Debit Card purchases in each calendar month AND receive total payroll or government direct deposits of $1,000 or more in the same calendar month. Once you qualify, enroll by turning on No Fee Overdraft in the app. Overdraft available for any debit card transactions only. ***Early access to direct deposit funds depends on timing of payer's submission of deposits. We generally post such deposits on the day they are received which may be up to 2 days earlier than the payer's scheduled payment date. SOURCE Varo Money, Inc. https://www.varomoney.com"

The consolidation of the two largest companies in the online immigration support industry will help break down the barriers that too many immigrants currently face. \"This acquisition is going to allow us to help more than 10,000 immigrants navigate an overly burdensome and complex process,\" said Xiao Wang, CEO and co-founder of Boundless Immigration. \"The move makes us the largest international online immigration company, expands our resources to support the best customer experience available, and helps us rapidly scale our business to even more categories.\" In conjunction with the acquisition, Boundless announced the closing of a $7.5M Series A-1, led by Foundry Group. The round brings Boundless's total equity funding to over $18 million dollars since 2017. In addition to Foundry Group, current investors, including Two Sigma Ventures, Trilogy Equity Partners, Pioneer Square Labs, Forefront Venture Partners, and Kevin Mahaffey participated in the round. About Boundless Immigration Boundless Immigration is dedicated to empowering families to navigate the U.S. immigration system more confidently, rapidly, and affordably.

    "text": "TAMPA BAY, Fla., Sept. 2, 2020 -- TeamViewer®, a leading global provider of secure remote connectivity solutions, announced a new integration with Microsoft Teams, allowing users to launch TeamViewer remote support and augmented reality (AR) connections from within the Microsoft Teams environment. \"Remaining productive while working remotely has never been more important,\" says Alfredo Patron Executive VP of Business Development at TeamViewer. \"Microsoft Teams is used by all types of organizations worldwide for online meetings, collaboration and more. Embedding TeamViewer remote access and AR support will give Microsoft Teams users even more options to collaborate and increase productivity regardless of location.\" The Microsoft Teams platform offers a wide variety of different communication capabilities and serves as a hub that contains the tools that remote teams need to perform their tasks. Now users can download the TeamViewer app from the Microsoft Teams Apps store, log into their TeamViewer accounts and immediately share TeamViewer invites for remote control or AR connections with their colleagues in 1-to-1 or group channels to collaborate and support them more efficiently when you \"just need to see\" what the problem is. AR connections are especially valuable when physical tasks are required -  with TeamViewer Pilot, you can 'virtually' point and draw in the user's field of view to demonstrate in detail what to do, as well as share files, type and talk. Moreover, through the intuitive TeamViewer device access toggle buttons, product teams can work more efficiently by instantly sharing access to all the required devices and environments with the rest of their working groups. Having the ability to do all these from within Microsoft Teams is key for an intuitive user experience and higher productivity. Once the integration is deployed, Microsoft Teams users can manage device groups they can access, share devices with team members and view their TeamViewer Dashboard as a personal tab, providing a view of all active sessions, connection history and a helpful user guide. To leverage this integration, organizations will need a Microsoft Teams license and a compatible TeamViewer plan. For more information, go to https://www.teamviewer.com/microsoft-teams.

    "text": "CLEVELAND and DELAFIELD, Wis., Sept. 2, 2020 -- Modern Hire, the all-in-one enterprise hiring platform that enables organizations to continuously improve hiring experiences and outcomes with trusted science and technology, today unveiled CognitIOn by Modern Hire. CognitIOn by Modern Hire is the company's industry-leading science, represented by its capabilities and expertise in data science, predictive analytics, artificial intelligence and industrial-organizational (I/O) psychology. It is also built on Modern Hire's deep experience with HR and hiring process, legal know-how and candidate focus, representing the deepest and broadest talent intelligence available to hire the most diverse, engaged and qualified workforce. \"Our team of Ph.D. data scientists and industrial-organizational psychologists are the best in their field and absolutely integral in everything Modern Hire does,\" said Mike Hudy, Ph.D. and Chief Science Officer at Modern Hire. \"The rigorous and ongoing science powered by CognitIOn by Modern Hire enables our clients to make more personalized, data-driven hiring decisions and provide a superior candidate experience. This launch reaffirms our commitment to driving research and innovation in our field while delivering practical new ways of measuring and understanding human performance in the workplace.\" CognitIOn by Modern Hire is powered by tens of millions of annual candidate interactions, practical application of advanced AI techniques, and nearly two decades of diligent, data-driven client research and practice by the company's 40+ Ph.D. industrial-organizational and data scientists. By combining comprehensive expertise in I/O psychology, talent selection science, diversity and fairness, candidate experience, the practical application of ethical AI, data science, advanced analytics, and employment law, CognitIOn by Modern Hire empowers its enterprise clients – including 47 of the Fortune 100 – to make more transparent, predictive, engaging and fair hiring decisions. CognitIOn by Modern Hire is embedded in all of the company's products and innovations, including its Automated Interview Scoring (AIS), an on-demand video interview feature that uses AI to evaluate candidate responses and provide recruiters and hiring managers with recommended scores to ensure a more fair, unbiased and complete hiring experience. AIS is currently available to existing clients as part of an Early Access Program and will go to general release later this year. AIS uses proven science, natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning to reliably replicate the judgment of professionally trained experts. While most models of this type are deployed with a 60% reliability factor compared to humans, Modern Hire presented scientific study results showing that AIS received a reliability score of 89% at a recent Society of Industrial-Organizational Psychology event – proving that AIS arms interviewers with a tool that enables more consistent, accurate, efficient and fair hiring decisions. \"Interviewing is a traditionally subjective and biased process. Through no fault of their own, interviewers incorporate factors not related to the job into their evaluation of candidates,\" said Eric Sydell, Ph.D. and EVP of Innovation at Modern Hire. \"AIS removes the subjective, biased nature of the interviewing process by focusing only on the job-relevant aspects of candidates' responses and evaluating every candidate on the exact same criteria. This creates a more transparent, ethical and consistent hiring process, while still enabling the interviewer – not the AI – to make the final decision.\" CognitIOn has been leveraged by Walmart, Amazon, CVS Health and Bank of America to win four of the last five prestigious Human Resource Impact Awards from SIOP and SHRM. These awards recognize each organization's hiring solution for saving millions of dollars annually in reduced turnover, saving decades of hiring manager time in increased efficiency, supporting extremely high-volume hiring, and delivering an innovative and engaging candidate experience.

    "text": "PLEASANTON, Calif., Sept. 2, 2020 -- Despite tight housing inventory across the country, Millennial purchase activity continued to rise in July, according to the latest Ellie Mae Millennial Tracker. Share of all purchase loans closed to millennials reached 61% for the month, up five percentage points from June. This increase marks the highest purchase share for the generation since March 2020. During July, millennial purchasing power grew as the average interest rate for all loans closed by this cohort fell to 3.25%, the lowest it's been since Ellie Mae began tracking this data. The previous low occurred just one month prior, when the average rate dropped to 3.36%. Younger millennials, those born from 1991-1999, were the sub-group responsible for the most closed purchase home loans for the month. 81% of loans closed by younger millennials were for purchases, while 19% were for refinances. This was a stark contrast compared to loans closed by older millennials (30-40 years-old), many of whom already own homes. Fifty-three percent of their loans were for purchases and 46% were for refinances. Younger millennials also took advantage of FHA loans in July. Ninety-seven percent of closed FHA loans for purchases were for younger millennials, the highest percentage since Ellie Mae started tracking this data in 2016. In comparison, 92% of closed FHA loans by older millennials were for purchases. Younger millennials also closed loans with a slightly lower FICO score average of 728 in July, compared to older millennials with an average FICO score of 747. Average FICO score for all closed loans across the generation was 739. \"We're seeing a new wave of younger millennial home buyers flood the market as we enter peak homebuying season,\" said Ellie Mae Chief Operating Officer, Joe Tyrrell. \"With interest rates at historic lows, now is the perfect time for younger millennials to purchase a home and start building equity.\" \"To encourage homeownership among the millennial generation, especially younger millennials, it is imperative lenders educate these borrowers on all loan types, including affordable options with less stringent credit requirements such as FHA loans,\" added Tyrrell.

Read the full report: https://www.reportlinker.com/p05955422/?utm_source=PRN However, most companies in the global adhesives and sealants industry are still in the early adoption stages of digital transformation in many domains and have put digitalisation to use in only a limited number of digital domains.Company research suggests digitalisation provides several growth opportunities for companies in the adhesives and sealants industry. This report tracks the industry's transformation and seeks to identify future opportunities for digital technology. The use of innovative digital technologies in business models will enable easier management of key operations, deep and wide databases, customer interactivity, and diverse applications and verticals. Such innovative business models are expected to take center stage in the next 5 to 7 years in the global adhesives and sealants industry.Nearly 50% of revenue from the global adhesives and sealants market is contributed by a small number of large global participants while the rest of the market is fragmented among several smaller companies. Of which, 7 of these 10 companies mostly operate in the formulation and sale of adhesives and sealants. The way in which digital technology will affect these companies will be strongly influenced by the specific requirements of the adhesives and sealants industry. The findings in this report will be presented using the same 7 domains identified in the previous study. These domains are as follows: • Digital Innovation investigates the use of digital technology in research and development and new product innovation. • Digital Sourcing tracks the use of digital technology in the process of finding and procuring raw materials. • Digital Business Models covers strategies designed to make a company's general business processes more digitalised. • Digital Plant looks at how adhesives and sealants plants themselves can benefit from digital technology. • Digital Product investigates the potential for adhesives and sealants (as a product) to be complemented by a digital offering. • Digital Customers looks at how digital transformation within the key end-markets (customers) is transforming their demand for adhesives and sealants. • Digital Marketing tracks the use of digital technology in marketing products to potential customers.In summary, this study will explore: • The enabling technologies behind digital transformation • Current activity among adhesive and sealant formulators and raw materials suppliers in the 7 digital domains • Future scenarios for adhesives and sealants in an increasingly digital world Author: Christeena ThomasRead the full report: https://www.reportlinker.com/p05955422/?utm_source=PRN About Reportlinker ReportLinker is an award-winning market research solution.

    "text": "LOS ANGELES, Sept. 2, 2020 -- This October, Polar Music/UMe celebrates Super Trouper, the album that soundtracked the Christmas season and far beyond 40 years ago. The first of only two albums that ABBA made in the 80s, Super Trouper was their sixth consecutive No.1 in Sweden, a chart-topper around Europe and a US Top 20 album. Powered by classic singles, including the title track, \"The Winner Takes It All\" and \"Lay All Your Love On Me,\" Super Trouper became the best-selling album in the UK in 1980. Taking its name from a large follow spotlight used on stage, the Super Trouper album seems a bright, shining statement, but in 2020, we now realize on how many levels ABBA worked. Of course, there is the beautiful shining pop, forever remembered in the smash-hit musical and film Mamma Mia! and the full dancefloors that ABBA constantly inspires. But there is also the masked sadness – virtually every fan old and new is aware that the story of ABBA is entwined with two star-crossed unions and breakups, those of Björn Ulvaeus and Agnetha Fältskog, and Anni-Frid (Frida) Lyngstad and Benny Andersson. Finally, the musicianship, production and arrangement, which makes Super Trouper sound as fresh and sparkling four decades later as when it was first heard in 1980. Super Trouper is well-known, too, for its cover, of Agnetha, Frida, Benny and Björn surrounded by carnival performers: the original idea was to shoot it in London's Piccadilly Circus. Unsurprisingly, that idea was rejected, and the cover was photographed in Stockholm. The circus has always been a powerful metaphor in art – throughout history, the joy of performance conceals an inner sadness. ABBA's global No. 1, \"The Winner Takes It All,\" could not make this plainer. The first single from the album, it was released in August 1980, with lyrics written by Björn for his recently divorced wife Agnetha to sing: \"There is so much in that song,\" Agnetha was to say. \"It was a mixture of what I felt and what Björn felt, but also what Benny and Frida went through.\" It shot to No. 1 in the UK, becoming their first chart topper in over two years – and was followed in November by the joyous title track. Coming in July the following year, the thumping 12 inch of \"Lay All Your Love On Me\" helped keep Super Trouper on the UK charts for a staggering 43 weeks. Being an ABBA record, Super Trouper's album tracks are almost as well-known as its singles. Among them, the stomping \"On And On And On,\" the classic \"Andante Andante,\" and the super-poignant \"Happy New Year,\" with its lines \"the dreams we had before are all dead, nothing more than confetti on the floor.\" Super Trouper closes with \"The Way Old Friends Do,\" recorded live at their record-breaking Wembley concerts the year before, which underlines that no matter what, the bond between ABBA would remain forever strong. Super Trouper is presented in an expansive half-speed master, carried out at Abbey Road by Miles Showell, and in keeping with recent releases there is a 7\" collector's box, and ultra-collectible picture disc set. Its beam still blinds us, all these years later. Highly collectible, strictly limited-edition picture disc 7-inch singles will be available to purchase separately via the ABBA Store, Sound of Vinyl and uDiscover.

    "text": "LOS ANGELES, Sept. 2, 2020 -- Independent publishing company Echelon Graphic Novels has inked a development deal with Platinum Studios, Inc., a comic book-based entertainment company controlling a library of thousands of comic characters. The multi-year agreement entitles Platinum to develop the properties into entertainment franchises for theatrical release, TV/streaming and merchandising. Platinum CEO Scott Mitchell Rosenberg will produce, and VP of development Kendall Rosenberg and development executive John Lechago will co-produce. Publisher Ethan Murphy founded Echelon to create an outlet for more diverse stories. The comics world has seen a massive influx of new authors and readers from all backgrounds, further fueled by conventions, where indie properties see greater exposure alongside the mainstream titles. The time is right for Platinum Studios to bring these stories to a wider audience on big and small screens. Echelon's flagship title, \"Slate & Ashe,\" about an unlikely partnership between a young, Black policeman and a zombie in a dystopian future, debuted in 2013 at Awesome Con in Washington, D.C., selling out of its initial run and garnering recognition as a Con favorite. Echelon has since expanded its team with co-owner and colorist Veronica Smith, editor Susan L. Holland, illustrators Zach Snyder, Eder Messias and Adam Fields, cover artists Carlos Eduardo and Luigi Teruel, and graphic designer and letterer Alex Scherkenbach. Echelon has self-published published three more titles, with another debuting in 2021: Rosenberg created and produced the $175 million-grossing Cowboys & Aliens, based on the New York Times best-selling graphic novel of the same name, which Platinum Studios also produced alongside Universal Pictures, DreamWorks and Paramount Pictures. Rosenberg previously owned Malibu Comics (later sold to Marvel/Disney), through which he brought the billion-dollar Men in Black franchise to Sony. \"After reading 'Slate & Ashe,' I immediately wanted to see more. Ethan's whole line of comics is as amazing as it is diverse. There's absolutely a wide audience potential for them all,\" Rosenberg said. \"Storytelling has always played a pivotal role in my life,\" said Murphy. \"I always knew that I wanted to carry on that tradition, but now, I'm more motivated than ever. People of all colors need to feel represented by what they read, inspired by heroes that genuinely resonate with them and given hope by a voice they can understand. I'm thrilled to have Platinum Studios join us on this journey.\" Visit www.echelongnovels.com for more information.

    "text": "ORLANDO, Fla., Sept. 2, 2020 -- Harrington Group International, a widely renowned business management company, is excited to announce that a new version of Harrington Quality Management System (HQMS) has been released. HQMS is now HTML5-compliant, which means it works with all modern web browsers. HQMS and the Collaboration Portal track the FPA/PPAP processes to ensure complete compliance with expected deliverables. With the introduction of this new feature, users can now create purchase and payment order reports to properly organize their recently procured materials and payment distributions, respectively. To confirm the delivery of materials from a supplier, users can now create receipt records. They can also add a supplier from the Supplier Records and link it to an existing purchase order. Receiving Inspection offers configurable AQL tables and provides an industry-standard workflow to accept or reject received materials. SCAR and MNC records can be created instantly to track inspection failures to resolution. The Supplier Deviation Change Request module is for documenting nonconforming or substitute parts. Without the Supplier Portal, users can now create the deviation record within HQMS and specify both the item and the supplier. Buyer Profile records are now utilized by Supplier records on their detail pages, allowing the user to specify up to four contacts for that particular supplier and displaying the contacts for their company. Users cannot create standalone debit memo records, but they can now initiate a debit memo within each Material Non-Conformance record. SCAR (Supplier Corrective Action Request) records in HQMS provide a means to assign corrective actions to suppliers. The supplier will provide its root cause, solution and evidence. HQMS now generates supplier scorecard records automatically with one scorecard per supplier each month. HQMS starts generating scorecard records after one month's worth of usage and they can be viewed or modified in the supplier portal. Users can now change their logins and passwords from the home page instead of the MY HQMS settings page. On the modules page, users can modify their \"My Modules\" list by simply selecting or checking modules. In the previous version, users had to click Update My Modules. The tabs on the right side now display in a drop-down box. All sub-lists within the tab areas include the export buttons if users wish to print or save this information. Users can move to the new page with a single click now. The toolbar will remain at the top of the screen with options to edit/save, open a new record, print and more. On a new or existing detail page, authorized users can modify or remove keywords and drop-down entries. harrington-group-international.jpg Harrington Group International Contacts Harrington Group International Introduces HTML5 Compliance & Other Improvements in HQMS Software http://www.harrington-group.com"

    "text": "ARMONK, N.Y., Sept. 2, 2020 -- The August findings of an ongoing IBM (NYSE: IBM) Institute for Business Value (IBV) survey of global consumers reveal that across the globe individuals remain highly concerned about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their daily lives, but there are clear differences in outlook across age groups and countries. The survey of more than 14,500 adults across Brazil, China, Germany, India, Mexico, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States showed that due to the pandemic individuals are making marked changes in how they work, shop and live – new habits that may not shift dramatically even once a vaccine becomes available. \"Our data tells us that many individuals are looking for more transparency and flexibility from their employers as they navigate this great uncertainty caused by the pandemic,\" said Jesus Mantas, senior managing partner, IBM Services. \"Organizations need to focus on building trust with their workforce and customers, and agility to deliver solutions that meet them where they are.\" Consumers globally report high levels of concern about the pandemic and its impact on their lives. The overwhelming majority of global respondents said they believe we will see more pandemic events like this in the future. 69% of Americans surveyed expressed concern about a second wave hitting later in 2020, while in the UK, Mexico, Spain and Brazil, at least three in four respondents expressed similar views. 70% of surveyed Americans said COVID-19 has made them more concerned about the safety and health of themselves and their families, consistent with July. 88% of Brazilians and 54% of Germans surveyed agreed. There is consumer optimism, however, with one-third of responding Americans who believe the U.S. economy will recover in 2021. Compared to other countries, respondents in India and China were the most optimistic about their national economies recovering in 2020. Globally, the data suggests there is a generation gap. Consumers' opinions about the impact of the pandemic vary widely across age groups: In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, more than half (52%) of Americans surveyed reported that they trust their employer. At the same time, their expectations about the measures needed to feel comfortable returning to a workplace remained high across August and July. 64% of Americans surveyed said employers need to clearly communicate what is being done to sanitize the workplace (63% in July), and more than half indicated interest in technology-driven solutions like systems for reserving spaces to avoid crowded 'hot spots' in the workplace. Some participating consumers seem to be feeling the fatigue of \"working from home\" feeling more like \"living at work.\" The percentage of responding Americans indicating they would like to continue to work remotely at least occasionally declined from more than 80% in July to 67% in August, and half said they wanted remote work to be their primary way of working (down 15 points from July). India had the highest percentage (33%) of respondents preferring to exclusively work remotely. Roughly one in three Americans surveyed cited mental health as the number one factor affecting their preference for their future working environment; nearly half of respondents in India and Brazil agreed. Other U.S. findings among those surveyed: New patterns for shopping and visiting venues in the U.S. reveal opportunities for businesses to provide options that meet consumers where they are During the pandemic, American consumers have been experimenting with new types of shopping services and tools – even across the technological generation gap. 44% of those surveyed have tried or would like to try placing an order via mobile app (30% pre-pandemic), 46% ordering online with curbside pickup (18% pre-pandemic), and 30% virtually trying on an outfit (9% pre-pandemic). But almost seven in ten Americans surveyed believe a COVID-19 vaccine will not be available until 2021 or later, and even when a vaccine is available, many consumers are not sure if they will be comfortable visiting many types of venues. Only 27% will definitely visit a shopping mall once a vaccine is available, 21% a movie theater and 18% a live sporting event. The IBV has surveyed more than 68,000 consumers since April and plans to continue polling the public in the months ahead. Later this fall, the IBV plans to release a report examining how more than 3,500 C-Suite executives globally are transforming their business to survive and thrive in the new normal across industries such as banking, retail, healthcare and technology.

    "text": "TEWKSBURY, Mass., Sept. 2, 2020 -- Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc. (CIL), the world leader in stable isotopes and stable isotope-labeled compounds, recently announced a capacity expansion for deuterated benzene at Cambridge Isotope Separations, LLC (CIS), located on 33 acres in Xenia, Ohio. This capacity expansion started in the summer of 2019 and consisted of two new reactors being added; the first was active in January 2020 and the second new reactor came online this summer. To complete the final phase of this expansion, an additional distillation unit will be active by the end of 2020. This is the first deuterated benzene capacity expansion at CIS since the process began in 2008. \"This investment in Xenia will increase our deuterated benzene capacity six times our current capability with additional capacity expansions easily achieved,\" said CEO Cliff Caldwell. \"It also demonstrates our ability to bring this solution to scale, meeting the market's expectations for quality, pricing, and demand.\" The capacity expansion of deuterated benzene has also allowed CIL to invest in new reactors to increase the production of deuterated bromobenzene in the Andover, Massachusetts, facility. \"The increased output of benzene-d6 allows CIL to yield more deuterated bromobenzene per month,\" said Vice President of Operations Warren Arenz. CIL's chemical synthesis group in Andover and the chemical engineering and isotope-separation group in Xenia continually work together to produce deuterated solvents and reagents for the growing analytical field and, more recently, for the increased demand in some new industrial applications for both the electronic and pharmaceutical markets. Deuterated benzene is being used in the manufacture of electronics as it is proven to increase performance. By harnessing the kinetic isotope effect, these companies will have better-performing electronics, faster microprocessors, and an increased life span of their devices, including OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode) screens. Bromobenzene-d5 is used in the manufacturing of electronic components and OLED displays. Additionally, pharmaceutical companies and CMOs utilize bromobenzene-d5 to manufacture deuterated active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). A potential benefit of replacing the hydrogen atoms with deuterium atoms is that deuterated compounds can have a slower pharmacokinetic effect, extending the absorption and distribution in the body. This may decrease the number of doses a patient would require compared to its non-deuterated counterpart. CIL continues to be the world's leading producer of deuterated NMR solvents and deuterated reagents for analytical and synthetic applications. For nearly 40 years, CIL has continued to expand its capabilities to produce deuterated solvents and reagents on a larger scale (multikilogram to metric ton quantities) and at even higher purities and enrichments to meet market demands. About Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc. CIL is the world's largest manufacturer and global supplier of stable isotopes and stable isotope-labeled compounds used in research, environmental, neonatal, pharmaceutical, medical diagnostic, OLED, and industrial markets. CIL is an operating business owned by Otsuka Pharmaceuticals. The CIL business consists of two facilities in the Boston, MA, area; a large isotope-enrichment production plant in Xenia, OH; CIL China; CIL Canada; ABX in Dresden, Germany; and Eurisotop in Saclay, France.

(OTC:HTSC) is pleased to announce that Charles Gryba, a specialist in designing mining methods, is now a strategic advisor of its wholly owned subsidiary, Fortune Nickel and Gold Inc. (\"Fortune\").  Since the age of 36, Mr. Gryba has been President and Director of four listed TSX or TSXV junior mining or exploration companies. \"I am very pleased to take on the role of strategic advisor to Fortune,\" said Mr. Gryba.  \"The battery requirement for nickel is spurring exploration for nickel in the Timmins camp. Canada Nickel is in the process of drilling off an exceptionally large deposit grading 0.3% nickel plus platinum, palladium, cobalt and gold with over 300-meter widths. Located just 10 miles to the southeast of Canada Nickel, Fortune has bought 100% ownership of 28 units in Gowan Township that has an 8.3-meter intersection in glacial till that graded 3.5% nickel and 1.2% copper just above bedrock.  This high-grade intersection is only 10 miles by road, directly north of the Kidd Creek mill which has an operational nickel sulphide circuit. The source of the nickel is probably just to the northwest.  It will be an exciting project finding the source of the nickel mineralization.\" Charles Gryba has been involved in the exploration of the Timmins Camp since 1980. From 1980 to 1986 he worked with Pamour to increase its gold reserves from 3 years to 8 years, while milling 6,000 tpd for those 6 years. In 1986 Mr. Gryba became President, CEO and Director of Moneta Porcupine Mines Ltd (TSX: ME) and spent 10 years exploring from Timmins to the Quebec border. In 1988, Moneta discovered the Michaud Orebody, which is still being explored and has more than 1 million ounces of gold. About Here To Serve Holding Corp.

    "text": "AUSTIN, Texas, Sept. 2, 2020 -- Overhaul, an intelligence driven, real-time supply chain visibility and risk management technology provider, announced today its Affinity Partnership with Texas Trucking Association (TXTA). Overhaul's software platform offers real-time visibility for supply chains with proactive, automated risk management. Additionally, the company is launching TruckShield, an app-based risk management solution for North American trucking. TruckShield utilizes existing hardware and technology to protect professional drivers and freight. An easy to set up and use solution, TruckShield provides three key elements. LoadLock allows a stationary shipment to be locked in place, automatically alerting the driver if the truck moves. If theft is confirmed, TruckShield utilizes LE Connect, an extensive network of law enforcement and recovery partners, to get ahead of the stolen cargo and recover it successfully. Finally, Claims Buddy, a post-accident claims management tool, offers guidance and simple information gathering to aid the driver after an incident. The trucking industry has been hit especially hard in recent years with high insurance premiums and nuclear verdicts, forcing many bankruptcy filings. This trend contrasts greatly with the overall need for more truckers and the strain of the COVID-19 pandemic on supply chains. TruckShield by Overhaul is a technology to help bridge the gap between driver safety, freight security, and insurance. The primary component of the new Affinity Partnership with TXTA entails Overhaul's new TruckShield solution to help protect professional drivers and the freight they're hauling. \"Overhaul is excited to partner with TXTA, as they work tirelessly to provide support for professional drivers,\" states Barry Conlon, Overhaul's CEO and founder. \"We look forward to driving greater innovation in the trucking industry.\" Texas Trucking Association is a trade organization dedicated to enhancing the effectiveness of its members by advocating sound public policies, providing excellence in education, training, and information, and promoting a safe, dependable, and cost-effective motor transportation system to better serve the people of Texas. \"Overhaul is a leader in the field of technology that is helping the trucking industry become even more safe and effective,\" said TXTA President and CEO John D. Esparza. \"TXTA is proud to partner with such an innovative company that will allow us to provide these essential benefits to our member companies.\" Overhaul will offer TXTA members early access to TruckShield, before a general market launch in 2021. \"With early access to TruckShield, TXTA members will be able to support their drivers, protect freight, and speed up insurance claims. This partnership is an important step in our innovative technology that reduces friction between the trucking industry and insurance providers,\" says Overhaul's Chief Risk Officer, Pat Stoik. Headquartered in Austin, Texas, Overhaul provides intelligent, real-time supply chain visibility and risk management software solutions for global shippers and logistics providers. In addition to its platform solution for supply chains, Overhaul is now providing a risk management app for the North American trucking industry to minimize loss and improve insurance relationships.

    "url": "https://www.prnewswire.com//news-releases/saskatchewan-polytechnic-chooses-igel-os-as-an-end-user-computing-solution-that-just-works-301122978.html",
    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 2, 2020 -- IGEL, provider of the next-gen edge OS for cloud workspaces, announces that Saskatchewan Polytechnic in Canada has adopted virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) along with IGEL OS to streamline how it delivers, manages and secures its entire end user computing (EUC) environment for over 16,000 students. This comprises 3,200 endpoints in 200 computer laboratories split across four geographically dispersed campuses. Darryl Meyers, Sask Polytech's team lead enterprise desktop management, explains, \"Students were the catalyst for change. Moving to VDI was a big change with many moving pieces. As part of this we needed a thin client platform that 'just works' which IGEL delivers.\" IGEL OS has been used to quickly convert existing Dell PCs into Linux-based managed endpoints. This means Sask Polytech can extend the lifespan of desktop hardware thereby saving CAD $1 million over five years as devices aren't refreshed annually. This frees-up budget to invest in other projects and helped to fund the educational institutions move to VDI. Sask Polytech is Saskatchewan's only polytechnic and the province's primary institution for post-secondary applied education and research. Offering more than 150 programs and employing more than 1,500 faculty and staff, Sask Polytech provides certificate, diploma and degree programs and apprenticeship technical training for students on four campuses - Prince Albert, Regina, Moose Jaw and Saskatoon - as well as through distance education opportunities and academic partnerships. Located at its main datacenter in Saskatoon, Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops has been installed running on clustered Cisco UCS Servers which utilize VMware's vSphere Hypervisor.  Sask Polytech worked with Canadian cloud specialist and IGEL reseller, iRangers, on the project. Implementing VDI meant a new desktop solution was required to provide connectivity and help the organization meet three primary goals. First, the technology had to be simple to learn, while offering advanced capabilities with easy implementation. Second, the polytechnic wanted to extend the physical lifespan of hardware in VDI-converted labs. Third, a consistent user experience was essential. VDI has drastically simplified how IT is now managed and enables staff and students to work in any computer lab at any time to access applications specific to their courses rather than being tied to particular physical classrooms and availability based on teaching schedules. Meyers says, \"Our technical team is small. Having something that they could have confidence in supporting properly was a priority. IGEL stood out. It matched our primary goals and then some.  And this has proved to be the case in practice. The simplicity of the system is its biggest advantage as it just works. Anyone can bring a computer online in minutes so we can respond to departmental requests for equipment really fast.\" The IGEL OS-powered endpoints have also enhanced IT security. Because the OS is 100% locked down, students can't move icons about, introduce malware or viruses which used to be a constant worry. Ken Shipman, IGEL's regional sales manager in Canada, said, \"For academic institutions where IT environments are complex and budgets at an absolute premium, IGEL OS is a compelling, unique and defendable solution. Converting and then leveraging existing PC hardware – some of which was 10 years old in Sask Polytech's case – saves a huge amount of money yet adds all the configuration and management features that anyone could require when tasked with running thousands of endpoints.\" Moving forward, the Sask Polytech EUC team will work on a project to install IGEL OS on desktop computers connected to peripherals in 600 smart classrooms. These devices include overhead projectors, smartboards, document cameras and so on. The target is to convert every computer room and computer to run IGEL OS by the end of 2020.

    "text": "PHOENIX, Sept. 2, 2020 -- SenesTech, Inc. (NASDAQ: SNES), a developer of proprietary technologies for managing animal pest populations through fertility control, today confirmed that California's AB1788 has been passed by the California Legislature and is being sent to the Governor for signature. California is poised to create the California Ecosystems Protection Act of 2020 (the Bill), which would prohibit the use of the four major Second Generation Anticoagulant Rodenticides (SGARs) commonly used in rodent pest control under many circumstances.  While the Bill is intended to address the vulnerability of wildlife to the lethality and ecologic persistence of these SGARs used for rodent control, it also creates a challenge to pest management professionals (PMPs) who incorporate SGARs in their integrated pest management (IPM) programs. Absent the use of these SGARs, pest management will have to rely on other lethal and non-lethal tools, such as fertility control. \"ContraPest® has been proven to increase the effectiveness of IPM programs in diverse environments such as San Francisco parks and neighborhoods, Washington D.C. urban areas, California animal shelters, and a number of California agricultural settings. This positions ContraPest as a potentially crucial addition to all IPM programs,\" said Kenneth Siegel, SenesTech's CEO. \"California has always been at the forefront of sustainable innovation in pest control, and I have no doubt that the industry will adapt quickly and effectively to this latest change. We will be working with California's PMPs to see how we can best support their IPM efforts in this new regulatory environment,\" said Dr. Steven Krause, SenesTech's EVP of Sales and Marketing. \"It is clear to me that other states will be watching closely to California's lead, and will move to adopt similar, proven innovations.\" SenesTech is changing the model for pest management by targeting one of the root causes of the problem: reproduction. ContraPest® is an innovative technology with an approach that targets the reproductive capabilities of both sexes in rat populations, inducing egg loss in female rats and impairing sperm development in males. Using a proprietary bait delivery method, ContraPest® is dispensed in a highly palatable liquid formulation that promotes sustained consumption by rat communities. ContraPest® is designed, formulated and dispensed to be low hazard for handlers and non-target species such as wildlife, livestock and pets, where the active ingredients break down rapidly. We believe ContraPest® will establish a new paradigm in rodent control, resulting in a decreased reliance on lethal options. For more information visit the SenesTech website at www.senestech.com.

Connell, a marketer and distributor of specialty chemicals and ingredients in the Asia-Pacific region, donated the main ingredient, 98% ethanol, along with additives of hydrolyzed jojoba ester and moisturizer. Dow, a global materials science company, contributed ACULYN™ 22, a Dow product that helped to give the sanitizer a pleasant, non-tacky feel. The sanitizer was produced and bottled in Yangon. Local production of the sanitizer for donation to the government has now sparked plans to offer the new sanitizer in Myanmar as a commercial product. \"This is a good, appealing, responsible product that stacks up to anything offered on the world market,\" Larsen said. Accordingly, the next step will be to go from producing institutional-sized bottles to small samples that can be distributed as part of a local marketing effort. \"We were happy to team up with Dow on our donation effort,\" Larsen added. \"Now we look forward to working to provide the people of Myanmar with a great product going forward.\" Connell is a leading marketer and distributor of specialty chemicals and ingredients in Asia-Pacific.

    "text": "NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J., Sept. 2, 2020 -- The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson today announced that it has made a strategic decision to discontinue the development of pimodivir, an investigational antiviral treatment for influenza A infection. This decision is based on recent results from pre-planned interim analyses of the pimodivir Phase 3 trial in hospitalized patients with influenza A, that found pimodivir in combination with the standard of care (SOC) was very unlikely to demonstrate added benefit in hospitalized patients with influenza A compared to SOC treatment alone. The study in hospitalized patients with influenza A and the parallel Phase 3 study of pimodivir in outpatients with influenza A will be halted. \"While our goal was to develop an innovative new treatment option for patients at risk of respiratory infections, unfortunately these data show that pimodivir does not offer a benefit above the existing standard of care,\" said James Merson, Ph.D., Global Therapeutic Area Head for Infectious Diseases at Janssen Research & Development.  \"At Janssen, we have a deep heritage of caring for those affected by respiratory infectious diseases and will continue to do so, focusing on clinical development programs that we believe will offer transformational medical innovation to patients.\" Pimodivir Phase 3 study was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of pimodivir in two Phase 3 trials in combination with standard of care (SOC) treatment in hospitalized adolescent, adult and elderly participants with influenza A infection (NCT03376321, known as 3001), and in non-hospitalized adolescent, adult, and elderly participants with influenza A infection who are at risk of developing complications (NCT03381196, known as 3002). The Company is in the process of informing all study investigators and relevant health authorities. This decision was reached in consultation with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and co-funder for the program. The pimodivir development program received funding support from BARDA under contract HHSO100201500014C.

The announcement follows yesterday's release of a shortlist of ten semi-finalists, selected by a preliminary judging panel as the ten best entries from all projects submitted. One of the premier events in Bitcoin Association's developer education programme, Bitcoin SV Hackathons are global coding competitions designed to challenge developers to both learn about the technical power of Bitcoin's original protocol and innovate on the fly. Organized by Bitcoin Association, run by leading blockchain research & development firm nChain, and sponsored by CoinGeek, Bitcoin SV Hackathons task entrants with developing an application or service within the parameters of a given theme that leverage the unique capabilities of the Bitcoin SV blockchain, all within a set period of time. The theme for the 3rd Bitcoin SV Hackathon was 'Connecting the world to one global blockchain'. A distinguishing feature of the Bitcoin SV blockchain is its ability to scale unbounded, enabling greater data capacity and high volumes of low-fee transactions sent instantly across the globe. These capabilities support the rise of a single digital currency (BSV) for micropayments, break down historical industry data silos, and facilitate technical interoperability in ways never before possible. Entrants were challenged to utilise these capabilities in their project, using the Bitcoin SV blockchain to establish new efficiencies and opportunities for interconnectivity. This edition of the Bitcoin SV Hackathon was the most competitive to date. In all, 418 people from 75 countries took part over an eight-week coding phase, with 42 final projects submitted for consideration. The three finalists will be invited to present their projects at the upcoming CoinGeek Live 2020 conference, September 30 – October 2.  The Hackathon Final Round presentations will be on Day 1 (September 30) of the conference, with winners announced on Day 3 (October 2). The finalists will compete for a share of a USD $100,000 BSV prize pool – $50,000 for 1st place, $30,000 for 2nd, and $20,000 for 3rd. Final placings will be determined by a combination of a Final Round judging panel and audience voting through an augmented reality experience for online attendees of CoinGeek Live. Kyrt Kyrt integrates Bitcoin microtransactions with subscribable events available via Zapier – a major platform enabling easy integration workflows across more than 2000 applications. Zapier is an incredibly powerful tool and by integrating a micropayment rail into any application interaction, the possibilities are endless. RepZip Identity on-chain is a fiercely discussed topic in Bitcoin SV and a key missing piece of infrastructure. RepZip not only provides a real solution to the problem, but also integrates with Paymail and existing Bitcoin data infrastructure in a way that can satisfy a plethora of use cases. Identity is powerful and is a core link between the digital and the physical world. When the solution integrates 3rd party attestation, this will become a core and central part of day to day Bitcoin interactions. STOTASK STOTASK is a new entrant in the 'gig economy' that allows owners of datasets to leverage the idle time of anyone to apply human interpretation to tag data. This is a missing link between human classification and machine learning. Classification tasks that are easy for humans but hard for machines can become machine-learned with an initial human input. Bitcoin SV is used as the payment rail for STOTASK, enabling work to be paid out in very small increments. Coupling this with Metanet data structuring in the future has huge potential. \"With each iteration of the Hackathon, we're seeing the quality and creativity of entries continue to improve. This time around, with the extended coding phase of the competition, it's clear that the additional time has been put into really developing these ideas into high-quality, well-thought-out submissions. I'm excited to see each of the three finalists present their project at CoinGeek Live, but it's certainly not going to be easy determining a winner!\" \"The standard of submissions for the 3rd Bitcoin SV Hackathon has raised the bar once again and reflects the continued maturing of Bitcoin SV development. What impressed me the most is the diversity of projects entered – business and consumer applications that each have a unique take on our theme of 'Connecting the world to one global blockchain' – but all with the common thread of leveraging the distinguishing powers of the Bitcoin SV blockchain. I'd like to thank all of the more than 400 people who took part in the competition.  While we select a champion in a few weeks' time, all the participants win by building on BSV.\" Bitcoin Association is the Switzerland-based global industry organization that works to advance business on the Bitcoin SV blockchain. It brings together essential components of the Bitcoin SV ecosystem – enterprises, start-up ventures, developers, merchants, exchanges, service providers, blockchain transaction processors (miners), and others – working alongside them, as well as in a representative capacity, to drive further use of the Bitcoin SV blockchain and uptake of the BSV digital currency. The Association works to build a regulation-friendly ecosystem that fosters lawful conduct while facilitating innovation using all aspects of Bitcoin technology. More than a digital currency and blockchain, Bitcoin is also a network protocol; just like Internet protocol, it is the foundational rule set for an entire data network.  The Association supports use of the original Bitcoin protocol to operate the world's single blockchain on Bitcoin SV."

Trashbots' full-service robotics platform comes with the hardware to build, the software to code and the training resources to support interactive learning.

Rohit and Sidharth were motivated to create a platform and a solution that is accessible and adaptable to any environment. The result has helped Trashbots become the future of STEM education. The Company will use this funding to grow their supply chains and inventory, marketing costs and new hires. \"We are thrilled to announce this next phase of growth for Trashbots. The global pandemic has uprooted our education system, as we know it, making room for innovation and the opportunity to reimagine the future of learning.\" Co-Founders of Trashbots, Sidharth and Rohit said, \"We launched Trashbots as a way to close the gap in STEM education by creating an accessible robotics and coding platform for every student and teacher worldwide. Now more than ever, the adoption of an affordable, high quality STEM platform will be crucial to rebuilding and preparing students for the modern economy.\" Past member of Major Lazer, Trinidadian DJ and entrepreneur, Jillionaire stated, \"As global economies develop and new technologies emerge, the demand for skills changes. Trashbots is poised to positively impact education outcomes across the world, by leveling the playing field and creating long term impact for the next generation.\" \"I'm excited for this partnership with Trashbots and helping to continue their work expanding STEM education globally.\" Added John Berkowitz, Co-founder and CEO of OJO Labs, \"By giving students the tools needed to bridge hardware and software, Trashbots is breaking down the barriers around robotics and coding.\" Trashbots is an affordable robotics kit created with the mission to make hands-on STEM education accessible to all.  Founded in 2017 by teenage brothers Rohit and Sidharth Srinivasan, Trashbots is pushing the boundaries of robotics and coding by providing low-cost robotics and engineering kits for schools and families with an artistic twist and structured curriculum.

Imposition of regulatory compliances regarding protection of private & sensitive data, decline in prices of hardware encryption devices, upsurge in penetration of consumer electronics such as smartphones and tablets, and increase in complexity & risk of data breaches & brute-force attacks drive the growth of the global hardware encryption market. On the other hand, high capital investment and limitations in use of encrypted devices in some countries restrain the growth to some extent. However, widespread adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) technology & cloud services and ongoing technological advancements in encryption chips are expected to create multiple opportunities in the industry.

The AES segment, on the other hand, would register the fastest CAGR of 33.0% during the study period, Wide acceptance of advanced encryption standard as a highly secure and fast algorithm for encryption fuels the growth of the segment. Based on architecture, the ASIC segment contributed to nearly two-thirds of the global hardware encryption market revenue in 2018, and is anticipated to rule the roost by 2026. This is attributed to rise in demand for ASIC in the consumer electronics industry because of low cost of implementation. Simultaneously, the FPGA segment would garner the fastest CAGR of 31.9% from 2019 to 2026. This is due to increase in popularity of FPGA algorithms on account of low cost and enhanced flexibility. For Purchase Inquiry: https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/purchase-enquiry/358 Based on geography, Asia-Pacific held the major share in 2018, generating nearly two-fifths of the global hardware encryption market. The same region would also register the fastest CAGR of 33.2% throughout the forecast period.

    "text": "PALO ALTO, Calif., Sept. 2, 2020 -- Today, Wealthfront launched an exciting new service called Autopilot that automates a client's savings plan so they no longer need to manually monitor accounts and move money around. This is a huge milestone toward Wealthfront's ultimate goal of delivering a nextgen banking service that fully automates their clients' finances, or what they refer to as Self-Driving Money™. \"Our clients are diligent savers and follow best practices to grow their savings, but they struggle to prioritize managing their finances among a long list of competing priorities,\" said Chris Hutchins, Wealthfront's Head of Autonomous Financial Planning. \"This can lead to missed days in the market or missed days of compounding interest, which has a huge negative impact on your long term net worth. Autopilot is your free financial assistant, automating your financial tasks to ensure your savings are put to work immediately in the best account for your goals.\" Autopilot can be set up in just a couple of minutes and monitors your account daily to ensure you only keep the amount of cash on hand that you really need. When your balance exceeds your prescribed amount, Autopilot automatically deposits the money into the account of your choosing. You can choose which account to monitor and save in and you always have full control over the routing if you need to cancel or change it for any reason. Many of Autopilot's beta users have been using the feature to take the stress out of monitoring their checking accounts for excess money to invest into the market. This has given them peace of mind knowing they don't need to constantly check accounts or pick the perfect day to invest. As one early user put it, \"I love not having to think about stuff and know it's being taken care of. It's nice knowing my money is going to be working for me without thinking about it.\" Wealthfront co-founder, Dan Carroll, is optimistic about the leap forward towards Self-Driving Money™ and the impact it will have on their clients' finances. \"We've set out to build a new system that makes money with our clients, not off of them as traditional banks do,\" he says. \"The system we're building has the potential to be one of the biggest wealth creation engines of our generation, automatically optimizing your money in the background while saving you time and stress.\" The next big area of focus for the company will be to improve upon the speed of money movement within the Wealthfront ecosystem.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-dollars-fall-is-likely-to-continue-heres-why-you-can-thank-the-fed-11598981331?mod=home-page",
    "text": "Foreign-exchange traders pushed the U.S. dollar to a new round of lows Tuesday before letting up, and currency watchers expect the greenback to remain under pressure on expectations the Federal Reserve will succeed in its attempt to drive inflation higher. There were no obvious catalysts for the initial Tuesday decline, but the dollar’s continued weakness comes after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell last week made clear that policy makers would tolerate above-target inflation as part of a new policy-making framework that abandons the central bank’s previous bias toward pre-emptively hiking interest rates when the labor market gets tight and signs of potential inflationary pressures build. “With Chair Powell cementing the negative real yield narrative for the dollar, there is little to suggest the current U.S. dollar bear trend is to stop, wrote analysts Francesco Pesole and Petr Krpata of ING, in a note. A resulting pickup in inflation expectations has dropped real yields — the yield on U.S. Treasurys minus expected inflation — to all-time lows. The real yield on the 10-year Treasury note on Tuesday stood near -1.08% after hitting an all-time low of -1.11% on Monday. The negative expected return makes the dollar less attractive to investors. The adoption of average inflation targeting and a tolerance for an inflation overshoot suggests interest-rate hikes “are a very distant proposition” and that U.S. real interest rates will remain low and may go even lower if the Fed succeeds in generating domestic inflationary pressure, they said. “None of these should strategically bode well for the dollar,” the analysts wrote, noting that high nominal and real rates were the key ingredients behind a stronger dollar in recent years. The dollar’s slide has been under way since spring, with the currency dropping back sharply after running to a more than three-year high in March as the pandemic-induced global economic collapse and accompanying financial market turmoil sparked a global scramble for dollars. As financial markets stabilized and central banks, particularly the Fed, stepped in to provide aggressive monetary stimulus alongside fiscal efforts by governments, the dollar has retreated. The Fed also moved to quench the global thirst for dollars by enhancing existing currency swap lines with major central banks and opening new ones. The dollar’s decline began to pick up steam in the summer, with the DXY falling 4% in July for its biggest one-month drop in nearly a decade. The dollar’s drop from its pandemic peak was already being attributed to falling U.S. real yields and expectations the global economy was poised to outperform the U.S. as the pandemic eventually runs its course. “The dollar cycle has turned because real yields have collapsed, in absolute and relative terms, and because the U.S. growth advantage relative to other major economies has been diminished,” said Kit Juckes, global macro strategist at Société Générale, in a Tuesday note. Related: Dollar could become a ‘crash risk’ if U.S. loses credibility, analyst warns Commodities are also seen benefiting from a weaker dollar, as it makes assets denominated in the unit cheaper to users of other currencies. Juckes argued, however, that last week’s Fed move was relatively “modest” after the policy makers in March proved their willingness to go far beyond what previous officials had done. Market participants, however, have embraced the policy changes without asking important questions, he said. Ahead of last week’s announcement, the Fed had already pledged to keep interest rates lower for far longer than previously anticipated, he noted. And, Juckes added, while the Fed’s willingness to allow inflation to move above its target for a time is a significant step, there’s little attention paid to the fact that the Fed has so far been unable to push inflation up to its 2% target any more than the Bank of Japan or the European Central Bank. “The currency has moved further than the shift in growth expectations so far would seem to justify,” he said, while bets on a falling dollar have pushed speculative positioning to an extreme, though “when that triggers a correction isn’t easily forecastable. ” Apple Inc.’s stock price will appear quite a bit lower Monday morning, but investors shouldn’t fret.

    "title": "The dollar’s fall is likely to continue — here’s why you can thank the Fed for that",

    "text": "Foreign-exchange traders pushed the U.S. dollar to a new round of lows Tuesday before letting up, and currency watchers expect the greenback to remain under pressure on expectations the Federal Reserve will succeed in its attempt to drive inflation higher. There were no obvious catalysts for the initial Tuesday decline, but the dollar’s continued weakness comes after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell last week made clear that policy makers would tolerate above-target inflation as part of a new policy-making framework that abandons the central bank’s previous bias toward pre-emptively hiking interest rates when the labor market gets tight and signs of potential inflationary pressures build. “With Chair Powell cementing the negative real yield narrative for the dollar, there is little to suggest the current U.S. dollar bear trend is to stop, wrote analysts Francesco Pesole and Petr Krpata of ING, in a note. A resulting pickup in inflation expectations has dropped real yields — the yield on U.S. Treasurys minus expected inflation — to all-time lows. The real yield on the 10-year Treasury note on Tuesday stood near -1.08% after hitting an all-time low of -1.11% on Monday. The negative expected return makes the dollar less attractive to investors. The adoption of average inflation targeting and a tolerance for an inflation overshoot suggests interest-rate hikes “are a very distant proposition” and that U.S. real interest rates will remain low and may go even lower if the Fed succeeds in generating domestic inflationary pressure, they said. “None of these should strategically bode well for the dollar,” the analysts wrote, noting that high nominal and real rates were the key ingredients behind a stronger dollar in recent years. The dollar’s slide has been under way since spring, with the currency dropping back sharply after running to a more than three-year high in March as the pandemic-induced global economic collapse and accompanying financial market turmoil sparked a global scramble for dollars. As financial markets stabilized and central banks, particularly the Fed, stepped in to provide aggressive monetary stimulus alongside fiscal efforts by governments, the dollar has retreated. The Fed also moved to quench the global thirst for dollars by enhancing existing currency swap lines with major central banks and opening new ones. The dollar’s decline began to pick up steam in the summer, with the DXY falling 4% in July for its biggest one-month drop in nearly a decade. The dollar’s drop from its pandemic peak was already being attributed to falling U.S. real yields and expectations the global economy was poised to outperform the U.S. as the pandemic eventually runs its course. “The dollar cycle has turned because real yields have collapsed, in absolute and relative terms, and because the U.S. growth advantage relative to other major economies has been diminished,” said Kit Juckes, global macro strategist at Société Générale, in a Tuesday note. Related: Dollar could become a ‘crash risk’ if U.S. loses credibility, analyst warns Commodities are also seen benefiting from a weaker dollar, as it makes assets denominated in the unit cheaper to users of other currencies. Juckes argued, however, that last week’s Fed move was relatively “modest” after the policy makers in March proved their willingness to go far beyond what previous officials had done. Market participants, however, have embraced the policy changes without asking important questions, he said. Ahead of last week’s announcement, the Fed had already pledged to keep interest rates lower for far longer than previously anticipated, he noted. And, Juckes added, while the Fed’s willingness to allow inflation to move above its target for a time is a significant step, there’s little attention paid to the fact that the Fed has so far been unable to push inflation up to its 2% target any more than the Bank of Japan or the European Central Bank. “The currency has moved further than the shift in growth expectations so far would seem to justify,” he said, while bets on a falling dollar have pushed speculative positioning to an extreme, though “when that triggers a correction isn’t easily forecastable. ” These tech companies have yet to report financial results for the quarter but have demonstrated they are benefiting from the pandemic.

    "text": "Deal talks for TikTok’s U.S. operations have hit a snag over the key question of whether the app’s core algorithms can be included as part of a deal, according to people familiar with the matter. The algorithms, which determine the videos served to users and are seen as TikTok’s secret sauce, were considered part of the deal negotiations up until Friday, when the Chinese government issued new restrictions on the export of artificial-intelligence technology, according to people familiar with the matter. Now both sides are trying to figure out whether the order means the algorithms need Chinese government approval for transfer, and if so, whether Beijing would sign off. The complexity involved has reduced the chances that a deal could be completed any time soon. TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance Ltd., has said it will comply with the Chinese government order, and is trying to get clarity from Beijing on how to proceed with a sale if the new restrictions apply to its algorithms, some of the people said. For bidders, the idea of buying TikTok without the algorithms completely changes the outlook on what the companies are bidding for, other people familiar with the situation said. They believe a large portion of the value of TikTok is in the suggestion algorithms that keep users glued to the app. An expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/google-is-making-advertisers-foot-the-bill-for-painful-new-digital-taxes-11599044982?mod=home-page",
    "text": "Google will pass on the cost of new European digital taxes to advertisers, incorporating these fees into its rates instead of paying them out of pocket. All three countries have instituted digital taxes within the last year, in an attempt to capture more of the revenues that technology giants generate within their borders. But investors worried that these digital taxes would hit Google’s bottom line will be relieved to hear that advertisers will bear the costs instead. Phil Smith, the director general of the ISBA, which represents British advertisers, said the move was “the inevitable outcome of the U.K.’s unilateral approach to digital taxation.” Starting November 1, a 2% fee will be added to invoices in the U.K., while customers in Austria and Turkey will have to pay a 5% fee on top of regular ad rates. These fees explicitly cover the cost of digital services taxes in the U.K. and Austria, and for Turkish customers represent “the complexity and cost of complying with regulations.” For now, Google won’t be extending fees covering digital taxes to all European countries that have imposed them, such as in France, which has committed to taxing tech giants this year regardless of whether an international tax standard for big tech is reached. Despite being relatively isolated from the economic impacts of the coronavirus pandemic, Google and Amazon have taken these fee decisions to protect their finances. Google’s revenues in the second quarter of 2020 remain only marginally lower than the year before, while Amazon’s share price is up over 48% year-to-date. Meanwhile, the advertising sector is in a rut, with marketing budgets being slashed across the board as companies cut costs to meet the economic challenges of the pandemic. “Digital service taxes and other regulations increase the cost of digital advertising. Typically, these kinds of cost increases are borne by customers,” a Google spokesperson said. “We’ll also continue to encourage governments globally to focus on international tax reform rather than implementing new, unilateral levies.” Opinion: Why the U.K. and France play against type in digital tax row with the U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is getting heat over a solo hair salon visit in San Francisco at a time when California businesses are limited by concern over coronavirus.

    "text": "The 2020 election race between incumbent President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden is a coin toss,  LPL financial chief market strategist Ryan Detrick says. Indeed, a number of polls and betting odds indicate that a once-yawning lead enjoyed by Biden is starting to wane. Real Clear Politics shows that the Democratic nominee is leading Trump by 6.2 percentage points, based on an average of national polls, and his advantage in so-called battleground states, stands at a relatively razor-thin margin of 2.7 percentage points, according to a separate RCP poll average. But Detrick says that a simple equity-market chart has been the best predictor of U.S. presidential elections since 1984, proving 100% accurate—and is 87% accurate since 1928. The LPL analyst says that a chart of the S&P 500’s performance in the three-month period ahead of Election Day, which is Nov. 3 this year, has proven accurate over the past nearly four decades. Detrick writes that a positive return over that three-month period “may signal an increased likelihood that the incumbent party may win, while stock market losses during the same period have tended to predict an opposition party win.” To be sure, the strategist acknowledges that the market isn’t the economy and that millions of people are out of work due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, but notes that a look at what stocks may say about the outcome of election may be one thing for investor to consider as they prepare for an uncertain stretch of trade ahead of that key vote. “The unique circumstances around this year’s pandemic seem to add plausibility that this could be the first time in almost 100 years that this signal may be wrong—especially if the stock market and economy continue to recover between now and Election Day,” he wrote. All that said, Detrick said that Trump is still contending with an even bigger factor that could stymie his re-election chances beyond the stock-market gains: a recession. “History has shown that when a recession has occurred during the two years before the election, the incumbent president has tended to lose,” the analysts wrote. “ In fact, the economy incredibly has predicted the winner of every presidential election going back to President Calvin Coolidge,” he added. That statistic also offers its own inherent caveat since the recession that ensued in this pandemic is a global one and occurred a stunning and historic rate. But the president’s handling of the current pandemic and the ensuing public-health crisis may be the one thing that voters weigh against or in favor of Trump. MarketWatch columnist Mark Hulbert, in an article on Tuesday pointing out the fallibility of trying to spot correlations between stock performance and election outcomes, says that investors should “be on your guard…for those using the stock market to predict who will win the White House in November.” Notably, he says that the historical data can be contorted to say a number of things but also that the range period, including a three-month stretch before the election, is arbitrary and should raise a caution for observers.

    "text": "It is hard to imagine a less-loved sector than energy. There is a whole host of worries. In the short term, there is less of a need for energy of any sort, since economies are still running well below capacity due to the coronavirus pandemic. There is also the potential of higher taxes in a Joe Biden administration, and, bigger picture, climate change, which not only makes the sector unpopular to environmentally-focused investors but also is likely to prompt tougher regulation. Which is where an interesting piece of research from Goldman Sachs comes in. Entitled “Reimaging Big Oil: The Age of Transformation,” the bank says a new European Commission rule kicking in by the end of next year can actually drive this shift. It will require companies to classify their activities with regard to sustainability. “Big Oils have always been vertically integrated in oil, from production to downstream processing, trading and retail, and have been able over recent years to develop and manage complex energy supply chains in natural gas. We believe that they have the capability to transition from international oil companies to integrated energy companies and see them integrating vertically in low carbon power, leveraging their brand and trading capabilities to acquire power customers,” say the analysts, led by Michele Della Vigna. Under what is called the EU taxonomy, Goldman analysts see five categories that are eligible to be labeled as sustainable in which Big Oils have a material or growing presence: low-carbon electricity; petrochemicals manufacturing; biofuels manufacturing; clean hydrogen and carbon sequestration. They estimate European big oil companies could increase their share of taxonomy-eligible revenue to 25% by 2030, from 7% now, and 50% of capital expenditure, from 10% today. One issue: most of these low-carbon businesses aren’t consolidated and remain off balance sheet at the moment, the analysts say. “We therefore view that as the low carbon electricity business expands, it will become more important for these businesses to be consolidated and for sufficient visibility over these businesses to be provided by the companies,” say the Goldman team. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease official, said a COVID-19 vaccine could be available earlier than expected if ongoing clinical trials produce overwhelmingly positive results. The National Institutes of Health said there are insufficient data to recommend either for or against the use of convalescent plasma for the treatment of COVID-19 — approved on an emergency basis by the Food and Drug Administration after White House pressure — and should not be considered standard of care. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued an order forbidding evictions of tenants who can’t pay rent due to the coronavirus pandemic through the end of the year.

    "title": "Only 19% of Tesla analysts say buy the stock while investors remain ‘insatiable’",
    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/only-19-of-tesla-analysts-say-buy-the-stock-while-investors-remain-insatiable-2020-09-01?mod=home-page",
    "text": "There is an old Wall Street saying that investing isn’t about being right or wrong, it’s about making money. No one understands that better than an investor in Tesla Inc.’s stock. The financial fundamentals and the historical valuations of earnings suggest the market is wrong about the electric vehicle (EV) maker’s stock price, according to the overwhelming majority of Tesla analysts. But the stock keeps rising and Tesla investors keep making money. No one is making more money than Elon Musk, Tesla’s chief executive officer, largest shareholder and arguably its most important cheerleader, who just became the third-richest person in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak, who has been bearish on Tesla since Jan. 23 2019, when the stock closed at $57.52, put it this way in a note to clients: Spak raised his price target to $290 from $170, but his target was still 42% below Monday’s closing price. See related: His short position just got ‘obliterated,’ but this Tesla bear isn’t giving up. Also read: Tesla takes advantage of stock’s best month in 7 years with $5 billion offering. There are some fundamental reasons for investors being right to buy, as Tesla has been profitable for four straight quarters, while Wall Street was wrong to expect losses in three of the past four quarters. And despite concerns about the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, Tesla delivered way more EVs than expected during the second quarter. While the 5-for-1 stock split Tesla announced on Aug. 11 didn’t improve the company’s fundamentals in any way, investors were right to buy or hold on to their shares, for now, as the price has charged up more than 80% since the announcement through Monday. Read more: Tesla stock rally accelerates further into record territory after split takes effect. Despite such strong investor conviction, 81% of analysts don’t recommend buying. Of the 36 analysts surveyed by FactSet, only seven, or 19%, have the equivalent of buy ratings on Tesla’s stock. And only one of those analysts, Jefferies’s Philippe Houchois, had a price target — $500 — that was above Monday’s closing price. Meanwhile, half the analysts had the equivalent of hold ratings and 11 analysts, or 31%, had the equivalent of sell ratings. The average price target of all the analysts was $261.85, according to FactSet, which implied a 47% drop from Monday’s closing price. Most of what analysts have been wrong about Tesla has taken place over roughly the past five months. At the end of March, when the COVID-19 crisis was full blown, there were the same number of bearish analysts as there are now and the average stock price target was $101.86, just 2.8% below the March 31 closing price of $104.80. With the stock’s gain since then, Tesla’s market capitalization increased to $464.3 billion as of Monday’s close, which was the seventh highest among U.S. companies. RBC’s Spak suggested that what may also keep supporting the stock is that given the sheer market valuation of Tesla, many portfolio managers have to add to positions “just to keep pace.” He also believes investors have been willing to show more patience and look further into the future to value the stock. “We still view Tesla as fundamentally overvalued and having to grow into its valuation,” Spak wrote. Spak recognizes that Tesla is clearly ahead of its competition, has relatively inexpensive access to capital, the ability to attract talent, an “incredible” brand, and understands that “narrative, momentum and other factors” can impact the stock price. But he still believes that ultimately, a company’s value is related to fundamental factors. Basically, he’s suggesting that one of the biggest risk factors to Tesla’s stock isn’t good or bad fundamental news, but how investors value that news. The next major potential news catalyst is Tesla’s “battery day” scheduled for Sept. 22, of which Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said recently he’s expecting a number of potential “game changing” developments. One of those developments is the “million mile” battery, which in theory will support an EV for 1 million miles, which could put Tesla miles ahead of its traditional gasoline-powered automotive competitors. That said, Ives is one of the analysts that doesn’t recommend buying — he’s at hold — while his price target of $380 suggests the stock could fall 24%. For those looking for actual fundamental risks, the following are just some of those included in the more than 20 pages of “risk factors” Tesla lists in its latest quarterly report filed on July 28. So far, those risks haven't mattered to Tesla investors. • “We are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer.” • “We have been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by the global COVID-19 pandemic, the duration and economic, governmental and social impact of which is difficult to predict, which may significantly harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.” • “We have experienced in the past, and may experience in the future, delays or other complications in the design, manufacture, launch, and production ramp of our vehicles, energy products, and product features, or may not realize our manufacturing cost targets, which could harm our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.” • “Our future growth and success is dependent upon consumers’ willingness to adopt electric vehicles and specifically our vehicles. We operate in the automotive industry, which is generally susceptible to cyclicality and volatility.” • “Any issues or delays in meeting our projected timelines, costs and production at or funding the ramp of Gigafactory Shanghai, or any difficulties in generating and maintaining local demand for vehicles manufactured there, could adversely impact our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition.” • “If our vehicles or other products that we sell or install fail to perform as expected, our ability to develop, market and sell our products and services could be harmed.” • “The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and we may not be successful in competing in these industries. We currently face competition from new and established domestic and international competitors and expect to face competition from others in the future, including competition from companies with new technology.” Apple Inc. shares  are up 1.7% in premarket trading Tuesday after J.P. Morgan analyst Samik Chatterjee raised his price target to $150 from a split-adjusted $115. Chatterjee wrote that \"investors have widely acknowledged the rich valuation\" of Apple's stock after the company became the first in the U.S. to notch a $2 trillion valuation in late August, but he still sees room to run for the shares. \"While the $2 trillion market cap valuation in itself is a significant milestone, that Apple shares crossed it in a year with significant COVID-19 disruption testifies to the recurring nature of not only its services, but also its products, such that investors are now willing to pay a services-like premium on the entire earnings stream and a modest premium on account of expectations for further revenue/earnings upside,\" Chatterjee said in a note to clients. Also on Tuesday, Bloomberg reported that Apple has asked its suppliers to build at least 75 million 5G iPhones in the coming months, which is similar to what the company asked for during its prior launch, a signal that Apple is seeing stability in its business despite the COVID-19 crisis. Apple shares have gained 60% over the past three months as the Dow Jones Industrial Average  has increased 12%.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-what-to-know-about-abbotts-15-minute-covid-19-test-11598982464?mod=home-page",
    "text": "On Aug. 26, the Food and Drug Administration granted an Emergency Use Authorization to a new rapid antigen test for COVID-19 called the BinaxNOW test. I study public health policy to combat infectious disease epidemics. Testing is one of the most powerful tools available to fight the spread of COVID-19. The new test is inexpensive, rapid and easy to use. It will massively scale up access to testing, but hurdles remain in achieving widespread, frequent COVID-19 testing. The credit-card-sized test is an antigen test that detects a specific viral protein from SARS-CoV-2. It costs $5 and doesn’t require a lab or a machine for processing. Performing the test is simple. A health-care worker or technician would use a swab to collect a sample from less than 1 inch inside the nostril. They would then combine the sample with a few drops of chemicals inside the test card. Within 15 minutes, the test strip would show a positive or negative result. The test is also paired with an app that produces a digital code that can be scanned to show proof of a recent negative COVID-19 test. The BinaxNOW test is currently only authorized for patients who have had COVID-19 symptoms for seven days or less, which is when virus levels in the body are likely to be high. It must be prescribed by a physician and performed by a trained technicianor other health-care worker. The PCR test for COVID-19 is currently widely used and considered the gold standard, but requires patient samples to be sent to a lab and can take days to provide results. The new antigen test is designed to be a cheap and quick alternative to PCR testing for diagnostic purposes in a medical setting. It would add critical capacity to an overstretched testing system. The emergency use authorization provides preliminary authorization for doctors to prescribe the antigen test while the full FDA approval process is ongoing. The authorization could be revoked if the test is not as accurate or reliable as expected. However, the true accuracy could be lower because the performance testing group was only 102 people and the accuracy hasn’t been validated by the FDA as part of the full approval process. There will inevitably be some false negatives and false positives with the BinaxNOW test since accuracy isn’t 100%, but the FDA will monitor the data to make sure the test meets the reported accuracy. The BinaxNOW test is cheap, rapid, able to be mass-produced and easy to use outside a lab. This makes it a promising candidate for widespread screening. However, the test is currently only authorized for people with COVID-19 symptoms. This is an obstacle because an estimated 40% of all COVID-19 cases are asymptomatic and these people likely don’t know that they’re contagious. To maximize the effectiveness of any COVID-19 screening program, it is important to test people whether they have symptoms or not. Health-care providers are able to prescribe the BinaxNOW test for asymptomatic patients for off-label use, but health officials don’t yet know how accurate the test is when performed on asymptomatic people. The massive expansion of testing access made possible by the BinaxNOW test will almost surely outweigh the downsides of a small number of inaccurate results. Abbott plans to manufacture 50 million tests per month starting in October. This will quickly exceed the 76 million COVID-19 tests the U.S. has performed over the last six months. Widespread, frequent testing is effective at slowing the spread of the coronavirus. The new testing capacity made possible by the authorization of this rapid antigen test represents a major advance in bringing the pandemic under control. Zoë McLaren is an associate professor of public policy at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. This was first published by The Conversation — “Will the new 15-minute COVID-19 test solve US testing problems?“ The major market indexes keep going up, but the notion that the stock market might be too frothy for its own good continues to be downplayed.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/an-experts-guide-to-road-tripping-with-your-dog-2020-09-02?mod=home-page",
    "text": "Even in the heart of a COVID-19 pandemic…make that especially in the heart of a COVID-19 pandemic, the summer road trip is a traditional taste of freedom that’s been celebrated since the automobile was invented. Inviting your dog to join you on these highway adventures makes you a much better person (just ask your pup). Keep in mind, however, that it’s going to take a little bit of planning. Nothing major, just some smart forethought and consideration for your 4-legged traveling companion. If you’re reading this story on your phone as your road-trip vehicle idles in the driveway, your dog in the seat next to you and you’re waiting for the Sherpas to finish packing the car, stop. You’ll still have a great road trip, but you should have started thinking through this journey with the dog a few weeks earlier. That’s when you would have gathered your pooch’s essential traveling tools like vaccination records, medicines, and a current dog tag with your mobile number on it. Of course, your dog has an ID microchip implanted because you love him/her, right? OK, be sure that the chip number is loaded into your smartphone. A pre-trip trip to the vet isn’t a bad idea either just to make sure everything is in order. And vet runs are always good practice for how well a dog travels. Another important pre-road trip consideration is which vehicle to take. If you’re a one-car family, of course, that’s academic. But if you have a choice, choose the SUV that has AC vents in back (your dog will worship you if you can get cooling air to the rear seats where most road trip dogs travel). Summer heat is unforgiving, especially to canines. Although SUVs work best for road trips with dogs — lots of extra gear comes along — cars will work just fine, too, and you won’t get any complaints out of Muttley either way. The important thing is to try to keep the second row — aka, the back seat — clear of luggage and gear so that your dog can take ownership of the space and feel secure in it. Leather seating cleans easier, but if you’re a big-dog owner, make sure you protect the rear seat from scratching nails with a pet hammock seat cover designed to keep your dog safe and protect the seat from natural pet behavior. It’ll also make cleaning up after the trip — dogs are dogs and they never learn to clean up their rooms, after all — infinitely easier. Other essentials to prep before you go are a no-spill water dish, treats (of course), toys (of course, of course), and a few items from home that carry your scent to comfort him, like a favorite blanket or even your pup’s bed. Don’t forget to pack food (pack about 15%t extra for travel) and food bowls. If you plan on camping or hiking, a first aid kit designed specifically for dogs is a good addition to your list. All you have to do now is get your dog’s Instagram account set up and you’re ready to travel. 1. I’m thirsty. 2. I have to pee. These sweetly ironic rules should come as no surprise. Water helps dogs function, flush toxins, regulate body temperature, and keep noses wet for optimal sniffin’. And it keeps them peeing throughout the day. When you’re on the road with a canine companion, always keep those two facts in mind as priorities. Pee stops are a good chance to get a little exercise, too, for both the dog and the driver. Speaking of exercise, no matter where you are on the journey, don’t hesitate to ask your smartphone for the location of the nearest dog park (every city and town has at least one) or if you’re doing a coastal trip, a dog beach. Both of these places are great shared communities where the natural practice is to stay at least 6 feet apart without seeming unfriendly. That’s true all across America, from the Union Square Dog Run in Manhattan to the Cayucos Dog Beach along California’s Highway 1. Plus, a worked out, sleeping dog travels best. Camping with dogs is a special kind of blast. These days, however, motels (and many hotels) seem to be getting more dog-friendly than ever. It’s easy to find a place where your tail-wagger can bunk with you free or for a very small fee. Many restaurants, too, especially now that coronavirus has forced so many dining establishments to expand their outdoor seating, are happy to accommodate with a big smile, a full menu and a fresh bowl of water for Fido. A road trip seen through eyes of a dog keeps car travel fresh. It may not always be super simple, but it is always rewarding and guaranteed to bring you and your companions, human and nonhuman, closer together. Treat every meal, motel stay and pee stop as a teaching and learning moment — a chance to refine your pup’s already stellar behavior. So relax and go have fun. If you and your dog have found a rhythm together at home, you’ll absolutely find one on the road. This story originally ran on Autotrader.com. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is using its authority to implement a temporary eviction moratorium through the end of the year, the Trump administration said Tuesday evening. Unlike the federal moratorium included in the CARES Act that expired in late July, the CDC's moratorium will apply to all rental units nationwide, senior administration officials said. Renters will be eligible for the moratorium's protection if they received a stimulus check, and they must be able to prove that they made an effort to receive government assistance and that they could not afford rent.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/uk-house-prices-surge-to-all-time-high-in-august-2020-09-02?mod=home-page",
    "text": "House prices in the U.K. surged to an all-time high in August, fueled by pent-up demand and record low mortgage rates, according to new figures from Nationwide. Britain’s biggest building society said prices jumped by 2% in August, following a 1.8% rise in July, marking the highest monthly increase since February 2004. Annual house price growth jumped to 3.7% last month from 1.5% in July. The average price was £224,123 ($298,864) in August, up from just under £170,000 10 years ago, Nationwide said. Robert Gardner, Nationwide’s chief economist, said the bounce back in prices reflects the unexpectedly rapid recovery in housing market activity since the easing of lockdown restrictions. “This rebound reflects a number of factors. Pent-up demand is coming through, where decisions taken to move before lockdown are progressing. Behavioral shifts may also be boosting activity, as people reassess their housing needs and preferences as a result of life in lockdown,” he said. The housing market was hit hard in March at the height of the lockdown, as estate agents were forced to close their offices and viewings weren’t allowed. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the next few months are crucial for Barratt because, while the group demonstrated its strength during the lockdown, an extended recession would prove an even tougher test. “The taxpayer funded furlough scheme, mortgage holidays and a ban on evictions are all due to be unwound in the autumn, which all could have major implications on demand for housing going forward,” she said. Read:U.K. jobs picture looks bleak with 7.5 million furloughed or away from their job Shares in Barratt rose 6.91% in early morning London trading. Gardner said that the trends look set to continue in the near term, further boosted by Chancellor Rishi Sunak’s recently announced stamp duty holiday — the transfer tax paid when buying a home. However, Gardner cautioned that most forecasters expect labor market conditions to weaken significantly in the quarters ahead, as a result of the after effects of the pandemic and as government support schemes wind down. “If this comes to pass, it would likely dampen housing activity once again in the quarters ahead,” Gardner said. The major market indexes keep going up, but the notion that the stock market might be too frothy for its own good continues to be downplayed.

    "text": "Bill Ackman has an idea for saving the system that made him a billionaire. The Pershing Square Capital Management chairman told investors in a recent note that, in order to preserve capitalism, steps need to be taken to close the increasing inequality gap. One possible measure: investment accounts for every child. Under Ackman’s plan, each child born in the U.S. would receive $6,750 in a government-funded basket of index funds that could only be tapped at retirement. Assuming 8% returns over 65 years from birth to retirement, that total would ultimately exceed $1 million, and it would cost the government about $26 billion a year, if the birthrate holds. “Compounded returns over time are indeed one of the great wonders of the world, and every day we wait to address this issue, the problem looms larger,” the hedge-fund manager wrote. He added that a government-led push for equities-investing accounts could “encourage greater financial literacy” and spread the stock-market’s gains across a wider swath of the U.S. population. “Americans that have no ownership in the success of capitalism, and who are suffering economically, are more motivated to turn toward socialism or other alternatives,” he said in the note. Meanwhile, Ackman’s strong showing this year continues, thanks in large part to a well-timed bearish bet on corporate bonds in early 2020. That investment yielded a profit of more than $2 billion during the March coronavirus meltdown in the stock market. President Donald Trump dove into the latest eruption in the nation’s reckoning over racial injustice on Tuesday, visiting the “destruction” left by rioters in Kenosha, Wisconsin, and declaring it was enabled by Democratic leaders.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/trump-camp-mocks-joe-biden-for-campaigning-for-president-of-animal-crossing-with-virtual-yard-signs-2020-09-01?mod=home-page",
    "text": "So much for playing videogames to escape reality — the 2020 U.S. presidential election has now even infiltrated “Animal Crossing.” Yes, the millions of people playing “Animal Crossing: New Horizons” since it was released for the Nintendo Switch in March, in which players build their own virtual islands populated by cute critters, can now add Joe Biden campaign signs to their digital front yards. Biden’s presidential campaign revealed its “Animal Crossing” partnership on Tuesday. “Show your Biden/Harris pride virtually!” it declared on its official campaign store, along with QR codes for players to scan and add the free political insignia all over their islands. The designs include the official Biden-Harris logo, a Team Joe logo, a “Joe” Pride logo, as well as a print of three aviator sunglasses in red, white and blue. “’Animal Crossing’ is a dynamic, diverse, and powerful platform that brings communities together from across the world,” Christian Tom, director of digital partnerships for the Biden campaign, said in a statement. “It is an exciting new opportunity for our campaign to engage and connect Biden-Harris supporters as they build and decorate their islands.” And the virtual campaign signs fit into the Biden camp’s pandemic playbook of hosting more online events, live-streamed fundraisers and speeches, while Trump has continued to campaign in person. Reps from Nintendo did not immediately respond to a MarketWatch query about whether the Biden campaign had to pay for those virtual signs to be available in the “Animal Crossing” game. Trump’s reelection campaign has not officially created campaign signs or T-shirts for “Animal Crossing,” although players can make their own — and in fact, have already done so. There are Trump and MAGA insignia on many individuals’ islands. CNN noted that, so far, there actually appear to be a few dozen more “MAGA” and “Trump” designs created by “Animal Crossing” gamers than Biden designs. Trump campaign deputy national press secretary Samantha Zager mocked Biden’s videogame gambit on Tuesday. “This explains everything: Joe Biden thinks he’s campaigning for president of ‘Animal Crossing’ from his basement,” she told CNN. “The Trump campaign will continue to spend its resources campaigning in the real world with real Americans.” Many people on social media also groaned at the Biden campaign’s “Animal Crossing” signs, as well, recalling Hillary Clinton calling on voters to “Pokemon Go to the polls” while she was running against Trump in 2016, citing another Nintendo gaming title. This isn’t the first time that political movements have made a mark in “Animal Crossing,” however. Players have also added Black Lives Matter flags and T-shirts to the game. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is getting heat over a solo hair salon visit in San Francisco at a time when California businesses are limited by concern over coronavirus.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/nvidia-launches-new-generation-of-gaming-chips-announces-fortnite-will-introduce-ray-tracing-11598978708?mod=home-page",
    "text": "Nvidia Corp.’s stock closed at a record Tuesday as the chip company launched its new line of gaming cards and detailed more videogames that are taking advantage of the ray-tracing technology that was introduced in the previous line of graphics-processing units. Huang announced the new chips in a YouTube video Tuesday morning, similar to his announcement of new Ampere-based server chips in May. The new cards build upon Turing architecture, which brought real-time ray tracing — the rendering of realistic-looking lighting and shading — to the fore. But when RTX ray tracing made its appearance two years ago, critics argued that developers were slow in putting out enough games that took advantage of the technology. Nvidia said the RTX 3080 will be available Sept. 17, with the RTX 3090 available Sept. 24, and the RTX 3070 “sometime” in October. That will give the company about six weeks of sales of the new cards before Nvidia’s fiscal third quarter finishes up at the end of October. Nvidia said the $499 RTX 3070 runs faster than its $1,199 RTX 2080 Ti, which is currently listed as out of stock, and up to 60% faster than its original RTX 2070, which was $499 when Nvidia launched its 20-series of Turing-architecture gaming cards two years ago. The upgrade to the RTX 2070, or the “Super” version that came out in July 2019, last listed at $499. Similarly, the mid-tier $699 RTX 3080 is up to two times faster than the RTX 2080, Nvidia said. The “Super” version of the 2080 card last listed at $699. At the high end, however, Nvidia appears to be offering a deep discount on improved performance. The company said its $1,499 RTX 3090 runs up to 50% faster and 10 times quieter than its flagship Titan RTX, which last listed at $2,499. Huang said demand for the limited-run Titan “surprised us” as filmmakers were using the Titan to make 4K movies, bloggers used it to build broadcast workstations, and others used the card for applications that required its power. “There is clearly a need for a giant GPU that is available all over the world, so we made a giant Ampere,” Huang said in his presentation. Nvidia would not comment on whether it would lower prices on its 20-series Turing cards. As of market close on Tuesday, the company had yet to change 20-series card pricing on its website, and was still offering its RTX 2060 Super card at $399. Less than two weeks ago, Nvidia execs talked a lot about gaming on the company’s earnings conference call even though data-center sales had surpassed gaming for the first time ever, with Huang forecasting “this may very well be one of the best gaming seasons ever.” Shares of DocuSign Inc.  are up more than 16% in Tuesday morning trading after Zoom Video Communications Inc.  reported July-quarter results showing that it made more than four times as much revenue as it did a year ago. Zoom's earnings, which topped expectations, suggested that technologies enabling remote business functions are still seeing explosive growth due to the pandemic. DocuSign, which enables electronic signatures on legal documents, is due to report its own results after Thursday's closing bell. Shares of workplace-messaging company Slack Inc.  is also seeing its stock rise more than 3% in Tuesday's session. Zoom shares are up more than 45% in the session and they'e gained nearly 600% on the year as the S&P 500  has risen 8.6%.

    "text": "The German Bundestag decided on Tuesday to launch a full inquiry into the downfall of payment company Wirecard, which filed for insolvency in June after €1.9 billion in cash were found to be missing from its accounts. Lawmakers want to probe possible government failures to uncover the scandal even as evidence accumulated over the last year. - Wirecard’s former chief executive Markus Braun is in custody on accusations of running a criminal enterprise that defrauded creditors of €3.2 billion. Braun and other Wirecard executives deny any wrongdoing. The company’s former chief operating officer, Jan Marsalek, has fled Germany and his whereabouts is unknown. - Both finance minister Olaf Scholz and Germany’s top financial regulator, BaFin, have been accused of turning a blind eye to Wirecard’s problems, first reported by the Financial Times in January, 2019, because the company was seen as a German fintech success story. BaFin even originally filed criminal complaints against the journalists who first uncovered the fraud. - “A picture has emerged that those fraudsters had it pretty easy,” said Florian Toncar, an opposition MP from the centrist Free Democratic Party. Lawmakers notably want to establish why Chancellor Angela Merkel lobbied for Wirecard during a trip to China in September, 2019, even as allegations of dubious accounting had already surfaced. The outlook: The inquiry could prove embarrassing for the two ruling coalition parties, Merkel’s conservative CDU and Scholz’s social-democratic SPD, one year before the general election scheduled in the fall of 2021. But the impact on the political careers of both parties’ leaders won’t be the same: Merkel is retiring next year, whereas Scholz will be running as his party’s candidate for the chancellor job.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/coronavirus-update-global-case-tally-tops-255-million-and-us-climbs-to-603-million-as-midwest-states-suffer-rise-in-infections-2020-09-01?mod=home-page",
    "text": "The number of confirmed cases in the U.S. of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 rose to 6.03 million on Tuesday, with new cases increasing in much of the Midwest and falling from their July peaks in the South and West. The U.S. added more than 36,000 new cases on Monday, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University, while more than 480 deaths were counted. Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota counted more cases in a recent seven-day stretch than any other seen since the start of the outbreak, the New York Times reported. The U.S. accounts for about a quarter of the 25.5 million confirmed cases globally and almost a fifth of the 851,781 deaths counted by Johns Hopkins, or 183,733. On a per capita basis, the U.S. is fourth in the world with 55.95 deaths per 100,000 people, the data shows, after Peru, Chile and Brazil. Twitter removed a post that was retweeted by President Donald Trump at the weekend, claiming the U.S. death toll is greatly exaggerated. The post was sent by “Mel Q,” an adherent of the QAnon conspiracy theory. It claimed that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had updated its COVID-19 numbers and found only 9,000 of reported deaths were from the virus, while the rest were people with two or three other serious illnesses. Twitter said the post violated its coronavirus misinformation policy. The social-media site did not remove another post retweeted by Trump from a conservative website that criticized key members of Trump’s own White House task force, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Diseases, and Dr. Deborah Birx, coordinator of the task force. Fauci told ABC in an interview Tuesday that the CDC numbers did not mean that people died of causes other than COVID-19. “That does not mean that someone who has hypertension or diabetes who dies of Covid didn’t die of Covid-19. They did,” Fauci said on “Good Morning America.”  “So the numbers you’ve been hearing -- there are 180,000-plus deaths -- are real deaths from Covid-19. Let (there) not be any confusion about that.” The head of the World Health Organization said the idea that high death rates from the virus are not a concern if it’s mainly older people who are dying is “moral bankruptcy.” “Accepting someone to die because of age is moral bankruptcy at its highest, and we shouldn’t allow our society to behave this way,” WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at the agency’s latest press briefing. • Russia has more than 1 million confirmed cases of COVID-19, the English-language Moscow Times reported, the fourth highest in the world, after the U.S., Brazil and India. Russia will start its first mass deliveries of its COVID-19 vaccine this month, Health Minister Mikhail Murashko said on Monday. The governor of a remote Siberian region, the republic of Tyva on the border with Mongolia, is reported to have contracted the virus for a second time in Russia’s first such case, the paper reported. Hong Kong researchers last week confirmed a case of a patient who had been reinfected with COVID-19. That same week, two European patients were reported to have suffered that fate, the Guardian reported, citing regional public broadcasters in the Netherlands and Belgium. • Poland has banned direct flights from 44 countries, including Spain and the U.S., to contain the spread of the virus, the Guardian reported, citing government officials. India, Brazil, Argentina, Malta, Montenegro, Mexico, Israel and Romania are also on the list, the paper reported, but China and Russia have been removed, local media reported. The ban will become effective on Wednesday. Poland has 67,922 confirmed cases of the virus, according to the Johns Hopkins data, and 2,058 people have died. • Tourism traffic to Spain fell 75% in July from the year-earlier period, according to Spain’s National Statistics Institute, costing the country billions of euros in lost revenue. Spain is currently grappling with a fresh spike in cases, after recording almost 24,000 new infections over the weekend. In the past two weeks, Spain has seen more than 96,000 new infections, according to its health ministry, making it a hot spot for the outbreak for the second time. Madrid is the epicenter, with about 16% of area hospital beds currently occupied by COVID-19 patients. • Hong Kong launched a mass testing program on Tuesday, amid heightened tensions with mainland China following its efforts to crack down on the city’s democracy movement. The free scheme has had a shaky start, amid concerns that the involvement of doctors and testing companies from the mainland will lead to harvesting of DNA and other data, the Washington Post reported. “I’m postulating that in the most optimistic case, perhaps a million people will turn up, but if I say that, I will be announced as unpatriotic,” said Gabriel Choi Kin, head of the Hong Kong Medical Association, the paper reported. “Ultimately, this will be a display of whether citizens trust the government.” • More than a million students returned to schools in the Chinese city of Wuhan on Tuesday, the original source of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to media reports. Wuhan was locked down for more than two months starting in late January and has reopened gradually since April. About 3,869 inhabitants of the city died from the virus, according to official Chinese data, accounting for more than 80% of China’s total official death toll of 4,724. Students had their temperatures taken at the school gates and were given lessons on hand washing, according to the New York Times. At least 16.9 million people have tested positive and then recovered from COVID-19, the Johns Hopkins data show. Brazil is second to the U.S. with 3.9 million cases and 121,381 deaths. India is next with 3.7 million cases and 65,228 deaths. Mexico has 599,560 cases but 64,414 deaths, the fourth highest in the world. The U.K. has 338,085 cases and 41,589 deaths, the highest in Europe and fifth highest in the world. AstraZeneca said the Phase III trial is seeking up to 30,000 participants to test the vaccine, designated as AZD1222. Participants will either receive two doses of AZD1222 or a saline placebo four weeks apart. In July, AstraZeneca said an early-to-mid-stage study showed the vaccine was “well tolerated and generated robust immune responses” against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. American manufacturers grew again in August for the fourth straight month, but companies still aren’t bringing back lots of workers or seeking to increase investment with the coronavirus pandemic still infecting the economy, MarketWatch’s Jeffry Bartash reported. The Institute for Supply Management said its manufacturing index rose to 56% in August from 54.2% in July. Readings over 50% indicate growth. Economists surveyed by MarketWatch had forecast the index to total 54.9%. Althought the index hit a 21-month high, manufacturers aren’t doing as well now as they were two years ago. Businesses executives are asked if their companies are doing better or worse compared with the prior month, but the survey doesn’t reveal how much better. Most manufacturers are producing fewer goods with fewer workers than they were before the coronavirus pandemic. The index had fallen to an 11-year low of 41.5% in April during the height of the crisis. The index for new orders jumped to 67.6% from 61.5%, marking the highest level since 2004. Yet other measures of actual production show new orders are actually still about 5% below precrisis levels. The production gauge rose to 63.3% from 62.1%. Timothy Fiore, chairman of the survey, said executives were “generally optimistic” but “to a lesser degree compared with July.” Coronavirus cases spiked during the summer and sapped the economy of some of the momentum built up in May and June. “Not all firms have the capacity to bring all of their staff back from furlough and those that do face difficult challenges in figuring out how and when to safely bring their workers back to work,” economists Thomas Simons and Aneta Markowska of Jefferies LLC wrote to clients. A big NIO bear is a little less bearish. And his upgrade is enough to get NIO shares moving again on Tuesday. Ciara Linnane is MarketWatch's investing- and corporate-news editor.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/a-lung-doctor-on-what-shes-learning-about-coronavirus-long-haulers-shortness-of-breath-and-fatigue-and-depression-but-also-improvement-over-time-2020-08-26?mod=home-page",
    "text": "This interview is the third in a series of conversations MarketWatch is conducting with some of the leading voices in the U.S. on the COVID-19 pandemic. Back in April, Dr. Dixie Harris and about 100 nurses and doctors from the Intermountain Healthcare hospital system in Utah flew to New York City to work in the region’s overburdened hospitals. Harris, a pulmonologist who studies e-cigarette vaping, worked for days in a row, caring for COVID-19 patients when the region’s local hospitals were overwhelmed. It was at Southside Hospital in Bay Shore, N.Y., that she started to learn about the virus, about why it’s better to put patients prone, why ventilators aren’t always the best option — and the importance of wearing a face mask. “One hundred of us went,” she said. “Zero came back positive.” Back home in the much more sparsely populated state of Utah, cases peaked at 876 on July 9, according to the Utah Department of Health. About 400 people in total have died as a result of a COVID-19 infection. (New York state has reported a total of 430,774 cases and 25,297 deaths as of Aug. 25.) As cases have declined, more of Harris’ focus has turned to patients who had COVID-19 in the spring and are still dealing with myriad health problems and symptoms months later. Many of these patients in the U.S. call themselves “long haulers.” They have reported fatigue, chest pain and neurological damage. “One of my first long-hauler patients had symptoms in March,” she said. “Five months later, and this patient was never in the hospital. That’s who I’m mostly seeing: patients who haven’t been in the hospital but continue to have ongoing symptoms.” Dr. Dixie Harris: We were there three weeks in April. It was pretty intense. It was right as the peak was going down, but there were still six times the number of ICU patients or more for the hospital I was working in. From what I could see, it hit pretty much within a week. It went from next to no COVID patients to overwhelming the whole system. I’ve had other people ask me, “Why didn’t they just ship some of those patients to another hospital?” Well, every hospital in Long Island was overrun with patients. And all the ambulances were so busy bringing new patients in, it’s not like they could say, “Oh, we’ll take this one patient all the way up to Albany. “ A tsunami is what they called it because there was no warning and it hit all at once. It was an incredibly dynamic learning environment. From when we started to when I left, care changed markedly. We were intubating early on. And then we said, “Wait a second, once they go on the ventilator, they’re on for three weeks. What can we do to avoid this?” The big key is proning. Even if you get some respiratory symptoms but you don’t have to be in the hospital, go ahead and move. Prone. Don’t just lay in the bed on your back at home. I will say it’s really hard to lay on your belly when your BMI is 45. When you’re really obese, it feels like you can’t breathe. So I tell the patients to sit up, lean forward. You’re trying to get the back upright. It was an honor to get to go there. The head of Northwell Health came when we were leaving about to get on the plane and came in to thank us. They did a water cannon salute in New York at the airport. When we were in the waiting area right at the jet way, probably 30, 40 people showed up and just gave us a shout-out clap. All wearing masks, all distanced. MarketWatch: It looks like Utah’s peak was in July. How is it different caring for patients there even now? Harris: We haven’t been overwhelmed. We have not had our ICUs completely full and so because of that we’re doing cutting edge best care possible. Every COVID patient is presented to infectious disease to decide which meds they qualify for. Harris: The laypeople are calling it long haulers. The British Medical Journal just did a nice review on management of post-acute COVID patients. They’re calling it long COVID. In the medical community, we haven’t fully named it. But I’m [also] aware of patients who consider themselves long haulers who have never (been) diagnosed positive for COVID. They feel they have it because they have the symptoms, the time frame, and all that. Harris: That’s really what we are just learning. Who I get are patients who two to three months later are still having shortness of breath, still having aches and pains, and maybe chest symptoms. Many of them are still on oxygen. Now mind you, we are at higher elevation. So some of these patients would not necessarily be hypoxic if they were at sea level. Still, these are people who are used to living here, so their body is adjusted to it. Dr. Kirk Knowlton, [Intermountain’s director of cardiovascular research, critical care physician Dr. Eliotte Hirshberg] and I are going to be talking to our leadership about developing protocols to take care of these patients. Part of it is to acknowledge that patients are still having symptoms. One of my first long-hauler patients had symptoms in March. I talked to the patient a week and a half ago, and he is still having a little bit of symptoms [but is] markedly better. Back to work now. But five months later, and this patient was never in the hospital. That’s who I’m mostly seeing: patients who haven’t been in the hospital but continue to have ongoing symptoms. In the BMJ article that just was published, they’re saying that 10% of patients who test positive remain unwell after three weeks. Their definition is if you have symptoms more than three weeks, you’re going into the long haulers. A lot of people are calling long haulers a month out. My colleague and I are presenting to our leadership — he’s a cardiologist, and I’m a pulmonologist — but we’re the ones who are aware of these cases two, three, four, or five months later. The fatigue and the memory issues. Depression. There’s a lot of non-pulmonary issues. Muscle aches. Anxiety. Everybody’s anxious in the day of COVID, right? Everybody’s stressed. Everybody’s had to adjust and learn. Primary care’s going to be addressing more and more of this. And our psychiatric services are going to be seeing this. My long haulers, most of them are on oxygen, and they all have pulmonary symptoms. But every time I see them, they’re a little bit better. I do see improvement over time. I will say that things such as prolonged symptoms — fatigue, that kind of thing — has been reported in MERS and SARS. MarketWatch: It’s not just a respiratory illness. Harris: Right. It’s a blood vessel illness. It’s a brain illness. It’s a muscle illness. MarketWatch: You’ve done some research around vaping and smoking. How do you talk to patients about these types of things in the context of COVID? Harris: It’s pretty well established that vaping nicotine does weaken the immune system. It especially affects how the nose can fight viruses. And how does COVID get in the system? Eyes, nose, mouth, right? You saw more cases of EVALI (e-cigarette, or vaping, product use associated lung injury) in April and May. A lot of the EVALI, like 90% to 95%, is due to the tainted THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) oil. [THC is the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis that makes people feel “high.”] I think people are going to THC with the stress of all the quarantines and all the changes. It makes sense people are reaching for that. Whatever you do, don’t vape the THC.

    "text": "Same-store sales were down about 35%, but Macy’s said it saw “faster paced store recovery than originally modeled and better than expected growth of digital business.” Digital sales climbed 53% from a year earlier. Gross margins were up 6.5 percentage points from the first quarter to 23.6%, while inventory was down 29% from last year, leaving Macy’s with a “clean inventory position” at the end of the second quarter. According to data from Placer.ai, Macy’s traffic was down about 44% in July. That may not sound great on its own, but it is a meaningful recovery from the 99% decline it notched in April, when the pandemic lockdowns closed its nonessential stores, and better than Nordstrom’s 65% year-over-year decline. Of course, with nearly 42% of Macy’s shares outstanding shorted, the pop could also have to do with bears covering their positions. Ultimately Macy’s was able to beat low expectations, but the structural problems facing department stores—from increasing competition to changing consumer habits—and the health and economic threat of Covid, will remain a problem for the company and its peers.

Europe’s common currency eased after Philip Lane, chief economist at the European Central Bank, reportedly voiced concern over the euro-dollar rate. “If there are forces moving the euro-dollar rate around, that feeds into our global and European forecasts and that in turn does feed into our monetary policy setting,” Lane said in an online conference on Tuesday evening. The comments weren’t too surprising and the ECB will probably stick to verbal intervention instead of cutting rates, Gizem Kara, economist at BNP Paribas in London, told clients in a note. The economist said “risk-reward of cutting is not favorable right now” and if the market perceives the ECB has used up its firepower, the currency could even rise.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/cdc-issues-nationwide-eviction-ban-through-the-end-of-the-year-in-an-effort-to-control-coronavirus-2020-09-01?mod=home-page",
    "text": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention implemented a temporary eviction moratorium through the end of the year, protecting U.S. renters from losing their homes during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Trump administration announced Tuesday. The CDC’s moratorium will apply to all rental units nationwide until Dec. 31 and goes into effect immediately, senior administration officials said of an unpublished CDC agency order. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told a U.S. House of Representatives panel Tuesday that the moratorium would cover around 40 million renters. Renters will be eligible for the moratorium’s protection if they received an economic impact payment, or stimulus check, as provided for by the CARES Act. Therefore, single renters must earn no more than $99,000 a year, while couples filing jointly can earn up to $198,000 annually. The order, which was shared ahead of being published in the Federal Register on Sept. 4, includes a declaration for renters to sign and give their landlord. Senior Trump administration officials said the form would be made available on the CDC’s website. Renters must indicate on the declaration that they cannot afford to pay their rent in full and that if evicted they would become homeless or force to move into congregate housing. Renters also must be able to prove that they made an effort to receive government assistance and that they could not afford rent. The moratorium does not absolve renters of paying the rent. That money is still due to landlords, and senior administration officials said that renters should still attempt to make partial payments when they cannot afford to pay in full. Landlords will still be permitted to evict tenants in certain cases, such as instances in which the tenant has destroyed property or poses a threat to the health or safety of neighbors. The moratorium builds on a previous executive order from President Donald Trump that directed the Department of Health and Human Services and the CDC to determine whether halting evictions was necessary to contain the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19. “In the context of a pandemic, eviction moratoria — like quarantine, isolation, and social distancing — can be an effective public health measure utilized to prevent the spread of communicable disease,” the CDC’s unpublished order said. “President Trump is committed to helping hardworking Americans stay in their homes and combating the spread of the coronavirus,” White House deputy press secretary Brian Morgenstern said during a briefing Tuesday. Housing advocates said the move was “long overdue,” but called for more help to be provided to renters facing financial difficulties amid historically high levels of unemployment caused by the pandemic. “As we have said for five months, the very least the federal government ought to do is assure each of us that we won’t lose our homes in the middle of a global pandemic: The administration’s action would do so and will provide relief from the growing threat of eviction for millions of anxious families,” said Diane Yentel, president and CEO of the National Low Income Housing Coalition. “But while an eviction moratorium is an essential step, it is a half-measure that extends a financial cliff for renters to fall off of when the moratorium expires and back rent is owed,” Yentel added, while calling on Congress to pass another COVID-19 relief bill with at least $100 billion in emergency rental assistance. Previously, some lawmakers and activists called for a cancellation of rent during the pandemic. Trump administration officials during Tuesday’s briefing said that renters and landlords would have access to emergency funds already in place, including billions of dollars in grants from the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the $142 billion coronavirus relief fund from the Treasury Department. Administration officials could not clarify whether the CDC moratorium would prevent eviction filings from occurring. Housing and legal advocates have raised concerns that landlords filed evictions against many people nationwide who should have been protected by the CARES Act moratorium. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is using its authority to implement a temporary eviction moratorium through the end of the year, the Trump administration said Tuesday evening. Unlike the federal moratorium included in the CARES Act that expired in late July, the CDC's moratorium will apply to all rental units nationwide, senior administration officials said. Renters will be eligible for the moratorium's protection if they received a stimulus check, and they must be able to prove that they made an effort to receive government assistance and that they could not afford rent.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/massachusetts-voters-to-decide-bitter-markey-kennedy-primary-fight-2020-09-01?mod=home-page",
    "text": "BOSTON — U.S. Sen. Edward Markey of Massachusetts defeated U.S. Rep. Joe Kennedy III in Tuesday’s hard-fought Democratic primary, harnessing support from progressive leaders to overcome a challenge from a younger rival who is a member of America’s most famous political family. It was the first time a Kennedy has lost a race for Congress in Massachusetts. Markey appealed to voters in the deeply Democratic state by positioning himself as aligned with the liberal wing of the party. He teamed up with a leading progressive, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, on the Green New Deal climate change initiative — and at one point labeled Kennedy “a progressive in name only.” That helped Markey overcome the enduring power of the Kennedy name in Massachusetts. The 39-year-old congressman sought to cast the 74-year-old Markey as someone out of touch after spending decades in Congress, first in the House before moving to the Senate. Kennedy said Tuesday night that the results aren’t the ones he’d hoped for, but pledged to work for Markey’s reelection. “The senator is a good man. You never heard me say otherwise,” Kennedy told supporters at an outdoor rally. Kennedy also suggested that the movement of supporters the campaign pulled together would continue past the current election. “We may have lost the final vote count tonight but we built a coalition that will endure,” he said. “I would this again with all of you in a heartbeat.” In the waning weeks of the campaign, Kennedy leaned into his family’s long political legacy in Massachusetts. His pedigree includes former President John F. Kennedy; former U.S. Senator and U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, his grandfather; and former U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy, who held a Senate seat in Massachusetts for nearly half a century until his death in 2009. Markey countered by leaning into his own family story — growing up in the working class city of Malden with a father who drove a truck for the Hood Milk company. In one campaign video, Markey also paraphrased a famous JFK quote, saying, “We asked what we could do for our country. We went out, we did it. With all due respect, it’s time to start asking what your country can do for you.” Markey also found himself on the defense at times during the campaign, with Kennedy repeatedly trying to portray him as having a tin ear to racial equity concerns. Kennedy faulted Markey for his initial opposition to the effort to desegregate the Boston Public Schools beginning in the 1970s. Markey countered by noting that he changed his views on the contentious issue that tore at the fabric of the city. He also said he supported the creation in 1973 of a state Senate seat aimed at helping elect a Black senator to the Massachusetts Legislature. Kennedy also repeatedly pointed to the father of Danroy “DJ” Henry, a young Black man from Massachusetts killed by police 10 years ago. Henry’s father has criticized Markey, saying he failed to help the family seek justice. Markey said he has apologized to the Henry family and signed a letter seeking a federal Justice Department investigation into the killing. Markey also wasn’t shy about talking about the Kennedy family, at one point pressing Kennedy to tell his father — former U.S. Rep. Joe Kennedy ll — to stop supporting a political action committee that was running ads against Markey. “I’m sure your father is watching right now,” Markey said. “Tell your father right now that you don’t want money to go into a super PAC that runs negative ads.” Kennedy said he had “no idea” if his father was helping fund the PAC. Late in the race, Kennedy also landed a major endorsement when Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi formally backed his candidacy. While Markey, who served with Pelosi in the House for decades, congratulated Kennedy, Pelosi’s decision angered some of Markey’s younger progressive supporters. Markey had earlier won the endorsement of Ocasio-Cortez and fellow Massachusetts Democratic U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren. “Ed Markey wasn’t afraid. He offered his expertise & partnership. He wasn’t scared of big policy & didn’t use kid gloves. It’s great to watch him overcome the odds and win tonight,” Ocasio-Cortez tweeted Tuesday night. The coronavirus upended the way both candidates could reach out to voters — severely limiting more traditional means of electioneering like knocking on doors, shaking hands or holding big rallies. Instead, the campaigns were largely waged online with virtual rallies, virtual endorsements, virtual fundraisers and virtual roundtable events to discuss issues. Eventually, as Massachusetts began to suppress the virus and emerge from a near lockdown, the candidates began to take their campaigns on the road — with appropriate social distancing rules and face masks in tow. The showdown drew criticism from some Democrats nationally who feared it would siphon time and money away from the primary goals of defeating President Donald Trump and winning back control of the Senate, It also wasn’t cheap, with both Kennedy and Markey raising millions to pay for campaign staff, television and digital ads and old-school campaign flyers. Markey now faces a general election contest where he is considered a strong favorite in a district that has historically elected Democrats. He’ll face the winner of the Republican primary, Kevin O’Connor, in November. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the federal government’s top infectious disease expert, says Labor Day weekend will be key in determining whether the U.S. gets a “running start” at containing the coronavirus this fall.

    "text": "That’s Mohamed El-Erian,  Allianz’s chief economic adviser,  explaining in an op-ed for the Financial Times how action in the options pits should be taken as a warning by retail investors who have been cashing in on the stock market’s relentless push higher in recent months. “The seemingly endless rally… gives the impression that prices are endorsed and supported by the entire professional investment community,” he said.  “After all, despite the vocal concerns over valuations having split away from underlying corporate and economic fundamentals, few fund managers have been willing to challenge the market by placing outright shorts. “ However, “sophisticated investors” are expressing their cautious views with the use of derivatives, and El-Erian says the mom-and-pop types should take note. “Much of this could be seen as market deepening were it not for one troubling fact: corporate and economic fundamentals have yet to reflect a sustained and convincing recovery from COVID-related damage,” he said. The rebound in consumption is slowing, initial jobless claims are back to the 1 million level for a second straight week, bankruptcies are rising, and, according to El-Erian, it’s looking like these short-term disruptions are about to become long-term scars. “Rather than a well-thought-out bet on the future, stocks reflect many investors’ resolute faith in a consistently favourable and predictable liquidity environment,” he wrote. “It is a backdrop anchored by reliable stimulus from central banks.” On the surface, the same can pretty much be said for what we’re seeing in the derivatives market, but there’s more to it than just that. “The fear of missing out on an unceasing equity rally has increasingly been expressed through call options,” El-Erian said. “Those who would normally short the market on concerns of excessive valuations appear to have no desire to be steamrollered once again by favourable liquidity and the strong ‘buy-the-dip’ conditioning that comes with that.” “It would take a big shock for markets to move significantly lower — such as a renewed sharp economic downturn, a considerable monetary or fiscal policy mistake, or market defaults and liquidity accidents,” he wrote. “But should such a move occur, the likelihood of further market turmoil would be high, especially given the current lack of a short base to buffer the downturn. This exposes small retail investors to big potential losses.” President Donald Trump dove into the latest eruption in the nation’s reckoning over racial injustice on Tuesday, visiting the “destruction” left by rioters in Kenosha, Wisconsin, and declaring it was enabled by Democratic leaders.

    "text": "U.S. stock-index futures were holding on to firm gains on Wednesday as investors drew hope from improvement on rapid testing for COVID-19, the possibility of a vaccine against the deadly disease, and potential progress in Washington another coronavirus fiscal stimulus package. Investors were digesting a private-sector jobs report that came in weaker than expected, well below the nearly 1 million that had been estimated for the month. An  account of business conditions in parts of the U.S. from the Federal Reserve is due later in the afternoon. Stock markets looked upbeat early Wednesday, with a number of possible catalysts helping the investing mood amid the coronavirus pandemic. Bloomberg reported that U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has again restarted talks with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, sparking fresh hope of another fiscal stimulus plan to help out-of-work Americans. On the health front, the leading health expert Dr. Anthony Fauci said that a COVID-19 pandemic could come sooner than expected if the roster of companies attempting to achieve a cure are able to produce outstanding preliminary results. Speaking to Kaiser Health News, Fauci said that the board that is overseeing vaccine approvals could decided that “the data is so good right now that you can say it’s safe and effective.” The global tally for confirmed cases of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 climbed to 25.8 million on Wednesday, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University, while the death toll rose to 857,552 Early moves in the session come a day after buying in large-capitalization technology stocks and shares tied to pandemic stay-at-home trends led the S&P 500 index to record its 21st record close of 2020 and the Nasdaq Composite its 41st on Tuesday. ADP did, however, raise last month’s jobs figure  to 212,000 for July from  a  rise of 167,000, which was then below forecast of 1.9 million jobs. The economy has recouped fewer than half of the 20 million-plus jobs lost in the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic. In other news, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention late Tuesday implemented a temporary eviction moratorium through the end of the year, protecting millions of U.S. renters from losing their homes during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Trump administration announced. Other economic data, will be watched, including the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book, an anecdotal account of business conditions in the central bank’s districts set to be released at 2 p.m. ET, and before that a report on factory orders for July is due. Reports on U.S. automobile sales will rollout throughout the day. These tech companies have yet to report financial results for the quarter but have demonstrated they are benefiting from the pandemic. Mark DeCambre is MarketWatch's markets editor.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/oil-prices-lifted-by-lackluster-bounce-in-opec-crude-output-inventory-fall-2020-09-02?mod=home-page",
    "text": "Oil futures traded higher Wednesday, finding support on signs of a slower-than-expected rebound in crude output by the OPEC+ alliance and a steeper-than-expected fall in U.S. inventories. “With one more week of U.S. driving season left, oil prices received a much needed helping hand from a bullish to consensus oil inventory draw,” said Stephen Innes, chief global markets strategist at AxiCorp, in a note. The American Petroleum Institute reported late Tuesday that U.S. crude supplies fell by 6.4 million barrels in the week ended Aug. 28, according to sources. The API data also showed gasoline stockpiles down 5.8 million barrels, while distillate inventories were down by 1.4 million barrels, they said. Crude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, storage hub, meanwhile, declined by 237,000 barrels for the week, sources said. The Energy Information Administration’s more closely watched storage data is due Wednesday morning. It’s expected to show crude inventories fell by 1.2 million barrels last week, according to analysts polled by S&P Global Platts. They also forecast supply declines of 4.7 million barrels for gasoline and 900,000 barrels in distillates. Some analysts played down the importance of the U.S. inventory data over the next few weeks, citing disruptions created by Hurricane Laura, which left nearly a third of oil production in the Gulf of Mexico still shut down as of Tuesday. “The U.S. inventory reports in the next few weeks…are unlikely to be particularly meaningful because the hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico have massively hampered the production and transport of crude oil and oil products,” said Eugen Weinberg, analyst at Commerzbank, in a note. Meanwhile, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries was slow in bringing back production last month as it relaxed output curbs, according to a Bloomberg survey cited by analysts. It found that members increased output by only half the amount allowed after OPEC and its allies, an alliance known as OPEC+, agreed to taper collective outputs to 7.7 million barrels a day beginning in August from 9.7 million barrels a day. Reuters on Tuesday reported that oil production by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries rose by 950,000 barrels per day to 24.27 million barrels per day in August, from July, following a three-decade output low in June. The move followed a decision by OPEC and its allies to taper collective output cuts to 7.7 million barrels per day starting May 1 from record cuts of 9.7 million barrels a day.

    "text": "Investors are betting people will go back to the movies. Wednesday’s premarket gains cut year-to-date losses in the stock to about 10%. Not bad for a company that posted a first-half 2020 loss of more than $25 a share and which was forced to suspend its 20-cent quarterly dividend. What’s more, shares are up about 230% from their 52-week low. The market expects things to keep improving. Hollywood, for one, is trying to help entice moviegoers back into theaters. AMC’s reopening plan coincides with Christopher Nolan’s thriller Tenet hitting U.S. screens. The film earned $53 million in the overseas box office last weekend, a meager sum for such a highly touted film in a pre-Covid world, but amid coronavirus lockdowns, the number looks great. Two top White House officials said Tuesday that a deal on a fresh round of coronavirus relief spending could still be reached, despite talks with Democrats stalling for more than a month. What’s Next: A smaller proposal is unlikely to break the deadlock. A so-called skinny bill has been repeatedly shot down by Democrats, who have insisted on a package commensurate with what they see as the size of the current crisis. The Senate is back in session next Tuesday. The largest school district in the U.S. delayed the start of in-person teaching after Mayor Bill de Blasio and the teachers union reached an agreement and averted the threat of a strike over classroom safety concerns amid the coronavirus pandemic. What’s Next: Teachers will return to school buildings on Sept. 8. The first day of in-person classes was moved to Sept. 21 from Sept. 10. Remote learning is delayed to Sept. 16 from Sept. 10. President Donald Trump traveled to Kenosha, Wis., on Tuesday to visit businesses that were damaged in the city during nights of unrest following the shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man, by police on Aug. 23. Protests and unrest have become a central theme of his re-election campaign. What’s Next: Joe Biden, who challenged Trump Monday to join him in condemning violence, is expected to break August fundraising records. The Biden campaign raised $70 million during its convention and a total of $300 million this month. The Trump campaign hasn’t reported its total, but raised $76 million during its convention. What’s Next: The inquiry could prove embarrassing for the two ruling coalition parties, Merkel’s conservative CDU and Scholz’s social-democratic SPD, one year before the general election to take place in the fall of 2021. But Merkel is retiring then, whereas Scholz will be running as his party’s candidate for the chancellor job. What’s Next: McDonald’s has pledged to increase diversity in the wake of George Floyd’s killing in police custody and had been in talks to settle with the Black franchisees since June, but those negotiations broke down, a lawyer for the franchisees said. I have been married to my husband for 38 years and we have three children together. When his mother passed away he received an inheritance of $8,000. I was never told about this money, and he spent all of it before I found out he even received his inheritance. When my father passed away, it was my father’s intent that any inheritance we received would be kept in my father’s family, so naturally my inheritance was made out to me and me alone. I deposited the money into a checking account with just my name on it. Within 30 days of receiving my inheritance, I purchased a home with the proceeds, and I was talked into putting my husband’s name on the deed. The check given to the seller’s attorney was a cashier’s check with my name alone. If I die before my husband is it possible to put the house into a living trust given that my father’s intent was to keep the money within the family, and not my married husband’s family? I want this home to be an inheritance for our children, and I don’t want him to sell it as soon as I die. I wish to make sure that he doesn’t sell it or rent it out in his lifetime. I would like him to live there until he dies. He has paid for a couple of renovations to the home. How would I go about making sure that my kids will have this home as an inheritance assuming I predecease my husband? —A.G. Read The Moneyist’s response. It was another wild day for Kodak stock.

    "text": "Gold futures headed lower Wednesday as global stocks rose and the U.S. dollar recovered from a  two-year low on Tuesday, creating some headwinds for bullion values. A weaker U.S. currency can make gold more attractive to overseas buyers on a relative basis and vice versa. “Bullion’s decline is proportional to the recovery of the greenback, confirming that the current movement is mostly related to what is happening on the currency markets,” wrote Carlo Alberto De Casa, chief analyst at ActivTrades. “In other words, the main trend for gold remains positive and a clear surpass of $1,990 and then $2,005 would open space for further rallies,” he wrote. Beyond the dollar, the decline in precious metals prices also came as global stocks enjoyed more gains on some hope for better daily testing for COVID-19 and perceived progress in vaccines.

    "title": "Rocket Reports Earnings Today. What to Expect.",
    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/rocket-reports-earnings-tomorrow-what-to-expect-51598999503?mod=home-page",
    "text": "Since its public offering, Rocket’s shares (ticker: RKT) have risen 38%, helped by the company’s preliminary second-quarter earnings released in mid-August as part of financial disclosures to bondholders. The company reported net revenue of $5 billion, a 437% increase from the same quarter in 2019, and adjusted Ebitda, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, of $3.8 billion, up 868% from the second quarter last year, the company said in a press release, owing to an elevated gain on sale margin as well as an increase in rate-lock volume. The company will report its official second-quarter earnings on Wednesday. Analysts anticipate generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) earnings of $1.39 per share on sales of $5.3 billion and Ebitda of $3.8 billion. Here are three things analysts are looking for. Bank vs. Tech Even before the company priced its IPO, there were debates about whether investors should value Rocket as a tech company or a mortgage originator. “On one hand, the value of their tech platform and ability to disrupt is significant,” writes Wells Fargo analysts Donald Fandetti, Michael Kaye, and Steven DeBartolo, who initiated coverage at the equivalent of Neutral with a price target of $29. “On the other hand, almost all of their revenue is from mortgage gain on sale which is volatile.” While analysts see the opportunity for Rocket, already the biggest player in the mortgage origination game, to secure a greater share in a highly-fragmented market using its proprietary digital platform, that market itself is highly cyclical, which could cut into earnings when sky-high refinance volumes return to earth. In its preliminary report, the company attributed its second-quarter growth in earnings to increased demand for mortgages and capacity constraints in the industry, which drove a 5.19% gain on sale margin, up from 3.22% over the same period in 2019. Looking farther ahead, analysts expect earnings per share of $3.16 for 2020 and $1.46 for 2021 according to FactSet, as capacity constraints decrease and Rocket’s currently elevated gain on sale margin falls. The second quarter “represented almost the perfect confluence of events” for an elevated high gain on sale margin, JP Morgan analysts write, citing falling rates, originator capacity constraints due to the surge in volume, and heightened demand for mortgage-backed securities due to Federal Reserve actions. “While we would normally expect [gain on sale margins] to remain between 3 and 4%, RKT generated a blended gain on sale of [5.19%], a level that is unlikely to be repeated within our modeled horizon.” “Origination volumes and margins are difficult to forecast given dependence on rates and competitor behavior,” writes a team of analysts led by Jason Kupferberg at BofA, who initiated at Buy with a $32 price target. Investors saw this sensitivity to rates play out in mid-August after government-sponsored entities Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac announced a 50 basis-point fee on refinances. Rocket shares fell 6.3% on the news, which critics warned would stymie refinance volume in the long-term and compel originators to cover the fee for locked-in borrowers in the short-term. The implementation of that fee has since been delayed until December. Even as analysts worry about Rocket’s exposure to mortgage rates, they see the company’s tech platform as well-positioned for growth. Rocket Mortgage’s first-quarter market share of the mortgage industrywas 9.2%, according to documents filed with the SEC, which the company aims to grow to 25% in 10 years, CEO Jay Farner said previously. “The biggest question mark in our model is how RKT deploys the significant amounts of capital generated in the coming quarters,” write a team of Barclays analysts led by Mark C. DeVries, indicating that the company is likely to reinvest a portion of returns into building its tech platform. Barclays initiated coverage at Neutral with a price target of $25. “Management suggested that there were some smaller opportunities on the horizon from an M&A perspective, and we get the sense that potential deals would focus on the real estate technology market over origination sensitive opportunities.” Analysts see the expansion of this program as key in the growth of market share. “Although a lower margin business, Partner Network volumes represent attractive business for Rocket as it brings additional customers into the servicing portfolio, where Rocket will have a chance to recapture future refinances on the mortgage,” the Barclays team wrote. A team of BofA analysts led by Jason Kupferberg also sees an expansion of Rocket’s partner network as a boon for growth. The analysts, who rate RKT shares a Buy with a price target of $32, noted that, while the partner network generates lower gain-on-sale margins, client acquisition costs are also lower. The company’s press release announcing preliminary results did not report direct-to-consumer and partner network segments separately, so Wednesday’s report will be the first look at both segments’ second-quarter performance. It’s a great time to be a mortgage originator with Rocket’s business model. The housing market’s recovery has seen demand for purchase mortgages and refinance loans remain elevated above 2019 levels for months. While some originators may struggle to match recent surging demand, Rocket is able to scale because of its tech platform, analysts say. “We believe RKT’s tech platform allows them to seamlessly handle spikes in volume, where many peer banks hit a capacity ceiling,” Wells Fargo analysts wrote. Rocket’s digital model also allows it to take advantage of another trend in the market, analysts write: digital-first millennials. “Rocket is well-positioned to take advantage of favorable demographic trends as millennials enter peak home purchasing age and expect a digital mortgage process,” write a team of J.P. Morgan analysts led by Richard Shane who initiated coverage at Neutral with a price target of $31. The surge of millennials in the market is one of two catalysts for short-term growth, wrote a RBC team led by Daniel R. Perlin who rate the company’s shares Outperform with a price target of $32. “U.S. demographics are on Rocket’s side, as millennials represent ~40% of new home buyers and rely heavily on technology for the buying process,” they wrote. That’s not the only demographic Rocket could cater to. RBC identified another near-term catalyst for the stock: nearly $11 trillion in mortgage debt outstanding from current homeowners that would benefit from refinancing at lower rates.

    "text": "The spirits giant said it had taken a €1 billion ($1.19 billion) impairment charge, particularly relating to Absolut Vodka, as the result of the pandemic, which closed bars and restaurants around the world for several months. Full-year net profit fell 77% to €329 million as a result, while profit from recurring operations fell 13.7%, beating analysts’ expectations as cost control measures took effect. Fourth-quarter sales tumbled 36% to €1.2 billion, as the pandemic hit sales in travel retail as well as bars and restaurants. However, there were signs of improvement in India and China as well as “better than expected resilience” in store and supermarket sales in the U.S. and Europe. Pernod failed to offer any specific guidance but Chief Executive Alexandre Ricard expected “continued uncertainty and volatility,” warning that the virus would impact social gatherings in the months ahead and economic conditions would also be challenging. Ricard said: “We anticipate a prolonged downturn in travel retail but resilience of the off-trade in the USA and Europe and sequential improvement in China, India and the on-trade globally.” Looking ahead. “Given the slightly better earnings delivery and improving trading backdrop in China, Pernod remains our preferred spirits stock pick,” Citi analyst Simon Hales said, while also warning that the sector was at risk of consumers snubbing premium brands in an economic downturn. Hales said there were limited positives for the sector, preferring soft drinks and beer ahead of spirits. Pernod stock rose more than 3% in early trading and is now just 8.5% down year-to-date, as investors welcomed the earnings beat and trading improvement. The reopening of bars and restaurants around the world will certainly help, and the popularity of drinking at home should continue, but the recovery is likely to be gradual rather than V-shaped with much uncertainty ahead.

    "text": "Don’t lock them out: lock them in until you have a deal. Shutting out private equity bidders was a favored tactic during the heady days of the debt-fueled buyout boom in 2003. So it’s a strange one to resort to when times are tough and private capital should be welcome. The troubled provider of insurance and cruises to the over-50s rejected a recent 33 pence-a-share takeover offer from a consortium of two unnamed U.S. private equity groups, which it said was“unsolicited and highly conditional.” Instead, Saga has chosen to tap its shareholders – which includes dozens of retail investors – for £150 million ($201 million) in an equity raise to cope with its spiralling debts. As part of the plan, Sir Roger De Haan, the son of Saga’s founder Sidney, will return to the company’s board as chairman, replacing incumbent Patrick O’Sullivan. Saga prides itself on looking after its loyal customer base. However, many of those loyal customers are retail shareholders who ironically, as a result of Saga’s proposal, will be diluted by more than 40% compared with the 140% premium they would have been received from the spurned private equity bidders’ offer. Saga’s convoluted proposal has De Haan, who sold Saga for £1.35 billion in 2004,  investing £75.5 million to buy 324 million shares, or an average entry price of 23 pence a share, to give him a 17% stake. In addition, by underwriting a third of the £75 million placing he could invest a further £25 million at 15 pence, lowering his average entry price to 20 pence and increasing his stake to 25%. That could be enough to block any future bids for the company, which may be in need of further investment in the future. The cruise industry – among those hit hardest by the pandemic – doesn’t look like it will recover anytime soon. Private equity has abundant supplies of dry powder to inject into troubled companies. The same can’t be said for shareholders who will be expected to stump up more cash in coming months as many companies look to raise equity to cope with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on their operations, which has left many of them reliant on borrowing to meet expenses. On Tuesday, AA granted its potential bidders –  which include a joint offer from Centerbridge Partners Europe and TowerBrook Capital, as well as separate cash bids from Platinum Equity Advisors and Warburg Pincus International –  an extra four weeks to make an offer for the company. Now is the right time for Saga to learn from its ex-sibling. Shares of Tesla Inc. were knocked lower Tuesday, as the electric vehicle manufacturer took advantage of the stock’s best monthly performance in seven years to raise more capital.

    "text": "A series of blockbuster deals drove corporate deal making to its strongest start of all time in the second half, as chief executives hit the acquisition trail again after sitting on the sidelines during the height of the pandemic. The combined value of megadeals announced so far during the second half of 2020 reached $256 billion, according to data from Refinitiv. That tally was only exceeded once in this period, in 2015. Nine deals worth $5 billion or more were announced in August alone — the biggest count for that month since 1999, dominated by the technology and health-care sectors. “A coalescence of deals on hold coming back to life, central banks providing copious amounts of cheap liquidity and companies seeking growth has led to an M&A [mergers and acquisitions] boom as deal makers have returned from pandemic enforced seclusion,” said Frank Aquila, global head of M&A at international law firm Sullivan & Cromwell. “Unless there is a significant economic shutdown in the coming months, M&A activity will likely remain at near record levels through at least the end of 2020 and likely well into 2021,” he added. Deals in the tech sector total $69.3 billion, accounting for 27% of global M&A activity during August. Six of the largest 10 deals announced globally during the month involved tech sector targets, while health-care deals total $38.5 billion, the highest monthly number since December 2019. The resurgence in deal making comes after the coronavirus halted a six-year M&A boom, as companies moved to preserve cash instead of pursuing big-ticket acquisitions. In April, dozens of companies worldwide drew down lines of credit, looking to bolster their cash piles as revenues collapsed amid the near-shut down of the economy. Activist investors also took a back seat at the height of the pandemic, as the tools that once boosted returns at target companies became impossible to use amid sinking valuations and the continuing massive government intervention in the world’s largest economies. Share prices have since recovered, spurring companies with strong balance sheets to target their more vulnerable rivals, but overall, activity is still down. During the first eight months of 2020, the value of global deal making reached $1.8 trillion, a 31% fall from the same period last year and the lowest year-to-date level since 2013, Refinitiv data shows. Asia-Pacific accounted for the highest share of year-to-date activity. On Aug. 31, French water and waste management group Veolia said that it had made an all-cash offer to acquire a 29.9% stake in its peer Suez from Engie, at a price of €15.50 ($18.46) a share. Suez issued a statement shortly after, saying Veolia’s approach “has been unsolicited and Suez had no discussion with Veolia about a possible merger.” It added that it has set up an ad hoc committee to examine the proposal. Last year, shareholder activist firm Amber Capital called for a strategy review at Suez, arguing that the French utility had underperformed rivals and could create more value for its shareholders. Shares of Tesla Inc. shot up into split-adjusted record territory Monday, as the lower price hasn’t changed the trajectory of the parabolic uptrend.

Tusa's price target was $5, which was tied for the lowest of the 21 analysts surveyed by FactSet, while he kept his rating at neutral. He said the fact that management has stopped short of calling for for positive free cash flow (FCF) during the second half of the year, despite Wall Street expectations of a V-shaped recovery that has FCF in \"solidly positive\" territory, is an \"indirect way of acknowledging remaining headwinds.\" Based on a FactSet survey of analysts, FCF is expected to improve to about negative $902.5 million in the third quarter and to positive $1.27 billion in the fourth quarter; it was negative $2.1 billion the second quarter. In the second-quarter post-earnings call with analysts, Chief Executive Larry Culp said FCF would improve sequentially in the second-half of 2020, then turn positive in 2021. \"Unlike peers, GE continues to have no official guidance, which in our view implies difficulty seeing 3-6 months out, while debt maturities and options resets suggest GE does not see normal until '24.\" The stock has tumbled 43.3% year to date, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average  has slipped 0.2%.

    "text": "With the U.S. economy grappling with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, investment advisers are seeing the ripple effects. Some clients fear losing everything they’ve built. For some, the threat of bankruptcy is a reality, while for others, even the remote possibility of going broke stirs feelings of dread. Advisers face a tricky challenge in aiding these anxious clients. On one hand, they have a responsibility to prepare individuals for the worst — and devise a plan if the money runs out. But in their effort to assist clients in desperate financial straits, they risk coming on too strong. Facing the likelihood of losing it all can prove immobilizing. Rushing to draft a detailed strategy and offer technical advice will backfire if a client isn’t ready to listen. First, an adviser needs to show concern and gather information. “Maybe the client is treading water with their anxiety,” said Meghaan Lurtz, a senior research associate at Kitces.com, which provides education and resources for financial planners. “Part of an adviser’s job is to be there while they tread” and serve as a sounding board. Advisers who set a supportive tone are better positioned to help clients grapple with their fear. Responding to anxiety with non-judgmental acceptance is a good first step. “It may be exhausting and stressful for advisers to deal with these clients,” Lurtz said. “But you still need to thank them for opening up to you. That makes them feel safe.” The next step is to try to learn more. To someone scared of losing their business, for example, say: “Tell me how things for you are going.” “Get to the heart of what the client is experiencing and what’s at the heart of their fear,” Lurtz said. “It may be they’re nervous about losing key employees to the virus or how long they can continue to pay them. Or it may be a decline in revenues and their P&L [profit and loss]. It may be about something else.” She urges advisers to make statements (“Tell me more about that”) rather than pose questions. That’s because clients are more apt to lower their guard and speak freely when responding to a neutrally worded prompt. “When we hear a question, our brain thinks there’s a right and wrong answer,” she said. “But people respond very differently to a statement. It cues the client that you really want to know, and solicits a richer type of response.” Advisers tend to draw conclusions from data analysis. If they think a client’s fear of losing it all is unfounded, they may trot out facts and figures as reassurance. Yet appealing to rationality when someone is not thinking clearly — and riddled with fear — carries risk. “Whether the fear is rational or irrational, it’s real in the client’s mind,” said Kim Bourne, a New York City-based certified financial planner. “So you have to get to the root cause, whatever is underlying that fear.” She cites the example of a client, a pre-retiree in his 60s, who feared a financial wipeout as the market tanked in mid-March. In reality, he held significant assets and faced no danger of bankruptcy. “He had the experience of poverty in his past, so he was afraid,” she said. “The fear of losing everything was lingering in his head.” Bourne dignified his fear. Instead of trying to appeal to his rational side by crunching the numbers, she sought to learn more about his feelings. “Tell me more about what it felt like when you didn’t have enough money,” she said. Then she asked, “What did you learn from those dark moments?” Then she asked: “How did that help you achieve your greatest financial accomplishments?” He came away with a restored sense of perspective, Bourne says, and his fear no longer plagues him as much. Employers ‘should be ready to answer questions, because they are going to get them.’ Morey Stettner is a writer in Portsmouth, N.H.

    "text": "Sophisticated algorithms are being used by one of Europe’s biggest movie theater chains to help with social distancing. Vue International, which has around 230 cinemas in the U.K., Germany, Taiwan, Italy, Poland and other European countries, has been using artificial intelligence to optimize screening times and is making adjustments to control the flow of audiences into auditoriums. Tim Richards, who founded privately owned Vue cinemas around 20 years ago, said 10 years’ worth of data had been fed in computers pre-COVID to decide on the timing and frequency for screening movies. This has now been adapted to control the flow of customers into the cinemas by staggering screening times. It is being linked with seating software that cocoons customers within their family bubbles, or on their own, a safe distance away from other customers. Richards, speaking at a press briefing on Monday evening, said: “It took me 17 years to build the group up to 230 cinemas. What happened just a few months ago was apocalyptic. “We have planned for crises such as a cinema being shut and blockbusters tanking, but not all the cinemas being down. Our big [cost] exposures are studios, people, and rent — we were quickly focused on our burn rate and liquidity.” Last month it was reported that Vue was lining up £100 million ($133 million) in additional debt financing. The firm is owned by Alberta Investment Management Corporation and pension fund Omers. Richards and other managers hold a 27% stake. Vue has been slowly reopening its cinemas around Europe over the past few weeks. “We have been using AI to help determine what is played, at what screen, and at which cinemas [to optimize revenues],” he said. “Our operating systems have been tweaked to social distance customers. It recognizes if you are with family and it will cocoon you. At the moment we are probably able to use 50% of cinemas’ capacities. “We can control the number of people in the foyer at any one time. Crowds would not be conducive to helping customers feel comfortable coming back. Every member of staff went through two days of safety training.” Richards said when he did reopen his movie theaters there was pent-up demand from customers but no new movies to screen. “We still managed at 50% run rate with classic movies that were not only already available on streaming services but on terrestrial television as well. People just wanted to get out of their homes and have some kind of normalcy.” Christopher Nolan’s complex thriller “Tenet” is the first major new film to be released and Richards said: “We are seeing ‘Tenet’ performing at the same levels as ‘Inception’ and ‘Interstellar’ did which has been amazing. “It will be a bumpy road in some areas but we expect a return to normalcy in six months — it will take a couple of months to get people comfortable again with their positions.” “Netflix has been disruptive for everything in the home,” he said. “We are out of the home, so Netflix is complementary to us because most people who like film like film on all formats. “I’ve seen the demise of the industry predicted definitely five or six times. We have been counter cyclical during downturns — we are reasonably priced so people come out and enjoy what we have to offer.” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is getting heat over a solo hair salon visit in San Francisco at a time when California businesses are limited by concern over coronavirus.

    "text": "The numbers: Private-sector companies added or regained 428,000 jobs in August, ADP said Wednesday, but the modest gain won’t dispel worries about a slowdown in hiring over the summer as the U.S. recovers from the coronavirus. Wall Street economists had forecast an increase of 1 million private-sector jobs, according to Econoday. See ADP report The increase in hiring last month topped a revised 212,000 increase in July, the giant payroll processor said. Initially ADP had reported that just 167,000 new jobs were created in that month. The economy has recouped fewer than half of the 20 million-plus jobs lost in the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic. What happened: Large companies boosted payrolls by 298,000, midsized companies by 79,000 and small companies by 52,000. Hiring rose the fastest in hotels, restaurants, retail, education, health care and professional businesses. The only segment of the economy to lose jobs again was information — media, public relations and the like. Big picture: The ADP report suggests the economic recovery ran into stiffer resistance for the second month in a row, but it’s not always a reliable bellwether. The report, for instance, has shown fewer new jobs created in each of the past four months than the government’s initial estimate. The Labor Department on Friday is likely to report the U.S. created 1.2 million new jobs in August, according to economists polled by MarketWatch. Yet what does seem clear from ADP and other employment barometers is that companies are bringing workers back more slowly compared to earlier in the summer. Or not at all. Some hard-hit industries such as travel and accommodation are even laying off employees again with federal aid drying up and most customers staying away.  That will make it even harder for the economy to return to normal. What they are saying?”The U.S. labor market recovery continued at a fairly sluggish pace in August,” said senior economist Andrew Grantham of CIBC Economics.

    "text": "It’s been no secret that China was among the first to emerge from the pandemic that is still ravaging much of the world — in part because it was the first to experience the crisis, but also because of its heavy-handed but effective lockdown. And compared with much of the world, China’s current conditions are exceptional, and it has been seen as the sort of sentinel in how to return, and how to gauge that return, to elements of normalcy. Schools are mostly back in session, the coronavirus is under control save for a few small pockets, and a steady stream of solid economic news has come in lately. China is likely to be the only country globally to see full-year 2020 economic growth. That being said, China’s National Bureau of Statistics reported on Monday that the manufacturing index fell, while the services reading rose a bit. The country has come an enormous way since January, when it locked down. Yet these measurements of normalcy are misleadingly narrow — they define “normal” in terms of select economic areas, low coronavirus numbers, and kids returning to school — all important metrics. But as China exerts its newfound superpower status, it finds itself grappling with the most challenges faced in years if not decades. Defined this way, things are far from normal. “In these days of the global pandemic, ‘normal’ is relative,” Karen Eggleston, director of Stanford University’s Asia health-policy program, told MarketWatch on Wednesday. Eggleston added: “China still faces numerous challenges, from handling the risks of reinfection, to making up for the foregone/delayed screening and care for non-COVID conditions, to quickly but carefully developing and testing vaccines and preparing for national deployment in an industry previously rocked by scandal, to trying to address the structural challenges underlying [the difficulty and expense of receiving medical care], and addressing disparities in lifecourse opportunities for healthy lives that leads to a more than 10-year differences in life expectancy across regions.” Thus, under the placid surface of China’s post-coronavirus return to life largely as it was, lies a slew of exceptions, setbacks and maneuverings that are both part of its escape from the pathogen’s grip as well as its ongoing rise as the world’s up-and-coming global power. China’s true unemployment rate may never be known given China’s opaque system — the latest reading by outside experts puts the number at 20% among recent graduates — the concentration-camp scandal and virus crisis in the Xinjiang region are roiling potentially millions of lives, border clashes with India and historically bad relations with the U.S. (aggravated by the pandemic) put it at loggerheads with two giant rivals, Beijing’s takeover of Hong Kong has upended many lives there, and the worst floods in decades are wreaking havoc across a quarter of the country. Last weekend, China implemented restrictive export rules for technology companies, which could complicate an order from the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump’s that ByteDance sell the American operations of its subsidiary TikTok by Sept. 15. The move mirrors the economic retaliations the countries have been lobbing since the trade war. Most observers are focused on the brighter day-to-day return to normal life. “From afar it looks a miserable year for all the reasons you cited, but relatively China appears to be doing better than many other countries that are still struggling with the pandemic,” said China expert  Bill Bishop, author of the Sinocism newsletter and a former MarketWatch executive. Susan Shirk, currently a professor at the School of Global Policy and Strategy at the University of California, San Diego, who previously served as deputy assistant secretary of state responsible for U.S. policy toward China, agreed, telling MarketWatch, “I believe that what people mean when they contrast China’s ‘return to normalcy’ to the situation in the U.S. and many other countries, is simply that people have returned to in-person work, school, shopping, dining, and even travel now that the virus has been controlled for the time being.  But of course, you are right that there are many features of pre-covid life that haven’t returned yet and the government is on high alert for any new outbreaks.” COVID didn’t cause all of China geopolitical and trade issues, its frayed relationships with more than a handful of countries. But it certainly exacerbated them. We might do well to rethink our definition of “return to normalcy.” Tanner Brown covers China for  MarketWatch and Barron’s.

    "title": "Renters in U.S. cannot be evicted through the end of the year due to coronavirus, CDC order states",
    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/cdc-issues-nationwide-eviction-ban-through-the-end-of-the-year-in-an-effort-to-control-coronavirus-2020-09-01?mod=home-page",
    "text": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention implemented a temporary eviction moratorium through the end of the year, protecting U.S. renters from losing their homes during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Trump administration announced Tuesday. The CDC’s moratorium will apply to all rental units nationwide until Dec. 31 and goes into effect immediately, senior administration officials said of an unpublished CDC agency order. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told a U.S. House of Representatives panel Tuesday that the moratorium would cover around 40 million renters. Renters will be eligible for the moratorium’s protection if they received an economic impact payment, or stimulus check, as provided for by the CARES Act. Therefore, single renters must earn no more than $99,000 a year, while couples filing jointly can earn up to $198,000 annually. The order, which was shared ahead of being published in the Federal Register on Sept. 4, includes a declaration for renters to sign and give their landlord. Senior Trump administration officials said the form would be made available on the CDC’s website. Renters must indicate on the declaration that they cannot afford to pay their rent in full and that if evicted they would become homeless or force to move into congregate housing. Renters also must be able to prove that they made an effort to receive government assistance and that they could not afford rent. The moratorium does not absolve renters of paying the rent. That money is still due to landlords, and senior administration officials said that renters should still attempt to make partial payments when they cannot afford to pay in full. Landlords will still be permitted to evict tenants in certain cases, such as instances in which the tenant has destroyed property or poses a threat to the health or safety of neighbors. The moratorium builds on a previous executive order from President Donald Trump that directed the Department of Health and Human Services and the CDC to determine whether halting evictions was necessary to contain the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19. “In the context of a pandemic, eviction moratoria — like quarantine, isolation, and social distancing — can be an effective public health measure utilized to prevent the spread of communicable disease,” the CDC’s unpublished order said. “President Trump is committed to helping hardworking Americans stay in their homes and combating the spread of the coronavirus,” White House deputy press secretary Brian Morgenstern said during a briefing Tuesday. Housing advocates said the move was “long overdue,” but called for more help to be provided to renters facing financial difficulties amid historically high levels of unemployment caused by the pandemic. “As we have said for five months, the very least the federal government ought to do is assure each of us that we won’t lose our homes in the middle of a global pandemic: The administration’s action would do so and will provide relief from the growing threat of eviction for millions of anxious families,” said Diane Yentel, president and CEO of the National Low Income Housing Coalition. “But while an eviction moratorium is an essential step, it is a half-measure that extends a financial cliff for renters to fall off of when the moratorium expires and back rent is owed,” Yentel added, while calling on Congress to pass another COVID-19 relief bill with at least $100 billion in emergency rental assistance. Previously, some lawmakers and activists called for a cancellation of rent during the pandemic. Trump administration officials during Tuesday’s briefing said that renters and landlords would have access to emergency funds already in place, including billions of dollars in grants from the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the $142 billion coronavirus relief fund from the Treasury Department. Administration officials could not clarify whether the CDC moratorium would prevent eviction filings from occurring. Housing and legal advocates have raised concerns that landlords filed evictions against many people nationwide who should have been protected by the CARES Act moratorium.

    "title": "As schools reopen amid COVID-19 pandemic, how long do asymptomatic children remain contagious?",
    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/as-schools-reopen-amid-covid-19-pandemic-how-long-do-asymptomatic-children-remain-contagious-11599043219?mod=home-page",
    "text": "A new study published in JAMA Pediatrics suggests that children can shed SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, even if they never develop symptoms or even for long after symptoms have cleared. It found a significant variation in how long children continued to shed virus through their respiratory tract and, therefore, could potentially remain infectious. While the virus was detectable for an average of about 2.5 weeks in the entire group, a significant portion of the children —about a fifth of the asymptomatic patients and about half of the symptomatic ones — were still shedding virus at three weeks. The researchers also found that the duration of COVID-19 symptoms also varied widely, from three days to nearly three weeks. A recent systematic review estimated that 16% of children with SARS-CoV-2 infection are asymptomatic, but evidence suggests that as many as 45% of pediatric infections are asymptomatic, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The signs and symptoms of COVID-19 in children are similar to other infections and noninfectious processes, including influenza. While children infected with SARS-CoV-2 are less likely than adults to develop severe illness or complications, they are still at risk of becoming ill. “Recent COVID-19 hospitalization surveillance data shows that the rate of hospitalization among children is low (8 per 100,000 population) compared with that in adults (164.5 per 100,000 population),” the CDC said. Such research comes at an important time for families and communities. Amid pressure from the teachers union to delay the start of the school year, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Tuesday that in-person classes will be pushed back until Sept. 21, 11 days later than planned. Remote learning, also originally slated to start on Sept. 10, will now commence on Sept. 16. Other countries have not fared so well with school reopenings. Israel, which also reopened schools this week, had less success when it reopened schools on May 17 amid high temperatures that made it difficult for students to wear masks, full classrooms that made social distancing near-impossible and, perhaps, the illusion that the virus had been vanquished, creating a false sense of security. The risk, as Israel discovered, is providing an environment where children unwittingly spread the virus to each other, which can lead to community transmission. That’s particularly worrying for those who have underlying conditions and the elderly who are more vulnerable to the most severe effects of the virus. Community transmission also makes contact tracing more difficult. A school outbreak can lead to community, hence staggered school reopenings, social distancing and reduced class sizes. “If we find a certain number of symptomatic people testing positive, we expect the same number of asymptomatic carriers that are much more difficult to identify and isolate,” said Enrico Lavezzo, a professor in the University of Padua’s department of molecular medicine. The latest study in the peer-reviewed JAMA Pediatrics focused on 91 pediatric patients at 22 hospitals in South Korea. “Unlike in the American health system, those who test positive for COVID-19 in South Korea stay at the hospital until they clear their infections even if they aren’t symptomatic,” said Roberta DeBiasi, chief of the Division of Infectious Disease at the Children’s Hospital in Washington, D.C. The patients here were identified for testing through contact tracing or developing symptoms. About 22% never developed symptoms, 20% were initially asymptomatic but developed symptoms later, and 58% were symptomatic at their initial test. The hospital staff tested them every three days on average, providing a picture of how long viral shedding continues over many weeks. Among the important findings from the study: Children, a group widely thought to develop mostly mild disease that quickly passes, can shed virus for weeks, DeBiasi and Meghan Delaney, chief of the Division of Pathology and Lab Medicine at the Children’s National Hospital in Washington, D.C., wrote in a commentary piece to accompany the study in JAMA Pediatrics. Other key points: Even asymptomatic children continued to shed coronavirus after testing positive, making them potential key vectors. In this study at least, there were a large number of asymptomatic patients: About one-fifth of the group in South Korean hospitals. They said the study provides important insight on the role children might play in the spread of COVID-19. But the study also has obvious limitations. One of these relates the link between testing and transmission. A “positive” or “negative” result may not necessarily mean that a child is infectious, “with some positives reflecting bits of genetic material that may not be able to make someone sick,” or, on the other hand, “negatives reflecting low levels of virus that may still be infectious.” They may have tested different parts of the respiratory tract and different testers may yield different results. It’s unclear whether symptomatic children shed different quantities of virus than symptomatic patients. They tested for the active virus – not antibodies – excluding those who may have had and cleared an asymptomatic or mild infection, an important factor for understanding herd immunity. However, DeBiasi said studies such as these can add to the knowledge of public-health efforts being developed and refined to bring COVID-19 under control. “Each of these pieces of information that we, our collaborators and other scientists around the world are working to gather is critical for developing policies that will slow the rate of viral transmission in our community,” she said. As of late Wednesday, COVID-19 has infected 25,773,958 people worldwide, which mostly does not account for asymptomatic cases, and killed 857,552. The U.S. still has the world’s highest number of COVID-19 cases (6,075,652), followed by Brazil (950,931), India (3,769,523) and Russia (1,001,965), according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University. In the meantime, cases keep rising in the U.S. with California becoming the first state in the country to surpass 700,000 confirmed cases; infections there hit 715,617 as of Tuesday with 13,150 COVID-related deaths. New York has recorded 435,510 infections and the highest number of deaths in the U.S. (32,966). COVID has killed 184,689 people in the U.S. AstraZeneca AZN, -1.10% , in combination with Oxford University; BioNTech SE BNTX, -5.61% and partner Pfizer PFE, -2.40% ; GlaxoSmithKline GSK, -1.61% ; Johnson & Johnson JNJ, -1.23% ; Merck & Co. MERK, -0.31% ; Moderna MRNA, -2.41% ; and Sanofi SAN, -1.34% are among those currently working toward COVID-19 vaccines. The Dow Jones Industrial Index DJIA, +0.75%, the S&P 500 SPX, +0.75% and the Nasdaq Composite COMP, +1.39% all ended higher Tuesday. Over the past five months, the Dow’s advanced 30%, its biggest 5-month percent gain since July 2009, while the S&P 500 added over 35%, its best 5-month run since October 1938.

    "title": "Moving? What you should know about doing it in a pandemic",
    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-to-move-in-a-pandemic-2020-09-02?mod=home-page",
    "text": "This article is reprinted by permission from NerdWallet. Moving is stressful enough without throwing a pandemic into the mix. Many Americans may be forced to consider moving as some federal foreclosure and eviction moratoriums have expired. In the first week of July, 32% of Americans did not make a full, on-time housing payment, according to a nationally representative survey by the website Apartment List. Others may relocate to save money, be closer to loved ones or simply leave a densely populated area. If you’re considering moving, here’s what to know from a financial standpoint, as well as tips to make moving day safer. Aside from the usual expenses like buying boxes, renting a van or hiring movers, plan for extra costs because of the pandemic. You may need to buy heavy-duty supplies to deep-clean your old place, for example, or to sanitize your new accommodations. If you are moving out of a rental unit, some landlords may ask you to pay for professional cleaners or take the cost out of your security deposit. The Big Move: I work in Silicon Valley, but my job is now remote. I can finally live somewhere cheaper. Where should I go? Moving across county or state lines? Check what the quarantine requirements are in your new location, says Jean Wilczynski, a certified financial planner and senior wealth adviser at Exencial Wealth Advisors in Old Lyme, Connecticut. You may have to pay for quarantine accommodations like a hotel or Airbnb if your new apartment or home is not move-in ready, she says. If you are receiving unemployment benefits, check the rules on how your benefits carry forward in your new location and what the taxes are if it is a new state, Wilczynski says. You can typically find this information on your state’s Department of Labor website, she says. If you are unemployed or your income has dropped as a result of the pandemic, you can also check whether you qualify for moving assistance by calling 211. You might not be able to really get to know your new place until you’re living there, so prepare yourself (and your wallet) for surprises like leaky faucets or broken appliances. Landlords and real-estate agents may offer only virtual tours. And if you can see the new accommodations in person, you may be required to sign a waiver, wear a mask and avoid touching anything while in the house. How to move safely depends on whether you are doing it yourself or using movers. Current guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that the main way the coronavirus spreads is through respiratory droplets, says Lindsay Slowiczek, pharmacist and drug content integrity manager at Healthline.com. That’s why wearing a mask and staying away from people is important to slow the spread of the virus, she says. Sanitizing surfaces is also an extra precaution worth taking. If you’re renting a moving truck, companies like U-Haul offer contactless pickup and drop-off options. Slowiczek suggests sanitizing the door handles, steering wheel, radio and the metal tongue on the seat belt in the rental van. Before picking a moving company, check its website or call and ask about its safety practices in response to the pandemic, Slowiczek says. Ask whether the movers wear masks and gloves during the move. On moving day, she suggests being prepared with a plan to limit interaction with movers and maintain social distancing. This includes packing as many things as you can yourself, or consider using a self-pack moving container as Slowiczek did for her own recent move. The Big Move: I’m tired of renting in Manhattan, but love living in New York. Is now the time to buy if the city is supposedly dead? If the movers will pack the truck, create a schedule for the movers. For example, ask them to start with a particular room as you stay in another. This is also particularly useful if you live with family members who are vulnerable or immunocompromised, she says. Try to limit their involvement with the move as much as possible. “Plan out the way [the movers] are going to move through the house,” says Slowiczek. “If possible, move all of [your boxes] to one area in your home so they don’t have to come throughout your house as much.” Keep hand sanitizer or soap handy during the move so that you and the movers can use it periodically, she says. (Check on the FDA website that your brand of hand sanitizer is methanol-free, Slowiczek adds). After the move, use disinfectants registered with the Environmental Protection Agency to clean surfaces or furniture. “Just using the product as-is is not enough — read the instructions on how long it should be wet on the surface,” Slowiczek says.

Grocery shoppers are cutting back on spending, data show, a sign that Americans are hurting for cash as the federal unemployment stimulus remains on hold for most recipients.

    "title": "Airlines are getting rid of flight change fees — but don’t expect air travel to get any cheaper",
    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/airlines-are-getting-rid-of-flight-change-fees-but-dont-expect-air-travel-to-get-any-cheaper-11598986778?mod=home-page",
    "text": "While multiple airlines have bid adieu to flight change fees permanently, travelers shouldn’t get their hopes up for fee-free flying in the near future. Almost all airlines have waived flight-change fees in some regard since the coronavirus pandemic became a major concern beginning in March. However, airlines have chosen to make the change permanent as the industry continues to struggle amid the pandemic. While the number of people traveling by air has increased substantially from the COVID-19-fueled lows in April and May, it still remains well below the norm. On Monday, over 711,000 passengers went through Transportation Security Administration checkpoints, the agency reported, which was two-thirds less than the 2.2 million people who went through U.S. airports a year ago. And with the peak summer travel season coming to an end, airlines are scrambling. “They’re seeing the writing on the wall and saying, ‘We could be facing some really empty flights this fall and winter,’” said Scott Keyes, founder and chief flight expert at travel website Scott’s Cheap Flights. By permanently doing away with the change fees, airlines are attempting to give travelers some peace of mind as they consider whether to make flight reservations during this still-uncertain time. If it’s still not advisable to travel come Thanksgiving or Christmas, travelers could simply switch to flights in 2021 without paying much more. “It takes away so much of the stress of booking a trip you know might not happen,” said Sara Rathner, credit cards and travel expert at personal-finance website NerdWallet. “Now, you can book a flight if you need to without feeling like you’ll be punished if you have to reschedule.” But consumers still need to read the fine print, even as airlines eliminate these fees. For starters, although consumers will no longer need to pay a fee if they change their flight reservation in some capacity with the airlines that have ushered in the new policy, they are still on the hook for any difference in fares. So if the new tickets cost more, you will be paying more. And if the new tickets cost less or you decide not to travel after all, you likely won’t be getting any sort of refund. “Free changes are not the same as free cancellations,” Keyes said. Many airlines have relaxed their rules regarding cancellations, allowing consumers to cancel their flights proactively. But passengers who do this in the vast majority of cases are being given vouchers for future travel rather than cash refunds. And those vouchers tend to come with expiration dates, meaning travelers must book new flights within a specified period of time or else they lose the money. While flight change fees weren’t necessarily the biggest driver of revenue for airlines, fees are still integral to their bottom lines. “Airlines have built their entire business model on fees,” said Christopher Elliott, chief advocacy officer at Elliot Advocacy, a nonprofit organization that supports consumers. “These are desperate airlines resorting to desperate measures.” Major airlines have copied this model, not only by offering “basic economy” tickets that replicate the budget-airline price point, but also by charging fees for extras like checked bags across the board. “People say they hate the fees,” Keyes said. “But what they really love more than low fees is low fares.” Given how critical fees are to airlines’ business model today, travel experts say that the unfortunate reality for travelers is that the future likely holds more fees and not fewer. “Just because airlines have eliminated change fees doesn’t mean we’re about to enter a new golden age of travel,” Rathner said. “Airlines will find a way to make up revenue because they need to stay in business,” she added. “We’ve already seen them lay off employees and cut routes. We may also see increased fares, or new fees get tacked on or rolled into the base fare.” In particular, airlines could use the past as inspiration: After the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11,  2001, some carriers began charging an additional security fee, Rathner said. “We might see fees that help cover the cost of enhanced cleaning procedure,” she said. And once the pandemic is over, experts said that airlines could very well reintroduce flight-change fees as people begin to travel more. An executive order by President Donald Trump called for distributing an additional $300 in weekly unemployment benefits from a $44 billion fund set aside for disaster relief.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-you-might-not-know-that-trump-is-threatening-your-social-security-2020-09-02?mod=home-page",
    "text": "One way U.S. voters are being played during this presidential election campaign is the deceitful manner in which key issues are being framed for their consumption. Arguably the biggest and most important of these concerns the so-called “third rail” of American politics: Social Security. President Donald Trump has vowed to kill funding for this critical, gargantuan program that nearly 70 million Americans depend on. What? You haven’t heard Trump say he wants to kill Social Security’s funding? Actually, you have. Trump says he wants to kill the payroll tax — which is how Social Security is funded. Perhaps like many Americans, you’re unaware of how Social Security is financed. It comes from payroll taxes that are paid by you and your employer. The past four years have convinced me that there are many other things that Trump’s supporters don’t seem to understand either (trade/tariffs, regulations, the stock market, etc.) but I digress. “If victorious on November 3rd,” the president said on Aug. 8th, “I plan to forgive these taxes and make permanent cuts to the payroll tax.” He then added: “I’m going to make them all permanent.” So when Trump talks of a “payroll tax cut,” you might think that sounds great. A tax cut! But this is deceptive election year politics, designed to take advantage of voter ignorance. Anyone in the media that’s going along with Trump’s framing of this as a mere tax cut is also being played. Trump seems to think that killing the payroll tax will save companies big bucks (His 2017 corporate tax cut wasn't enough?) while increasing the take home pay of American workers. Bigger take home pay? Tens of millions of Americans don’t have pay — period — thanks to the economic collapse brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. Important sidebar: Note that Trump said in late February, when the U.S. had just 15 coronavirus cases, that we would soon be down to none — proof, he said, that he was an effective leader. “When you have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that’s a pretty good job we’ve done,” Trump said at the time. Yet as of this writing, the U.S., with about 4% of the world’s population, has more than six million cases — one of every four on the planet. Not that this and other gross miscalculations and bumbling has stopped Trump from believing — and actually looking into — how he could be added to Mount Rushmore, alongside Presidents Lincoln, Washington, Jefferson and Theodore Roosevelt. It doesn’t get more delusional than this except, perhaps, for kooky Trump advisers like economist Stephen Moore, and even Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who has said that Social Security could always be paid for by moving trillions of dollars from the government’s “general fund to those trusts funds.” Trillions of dollars from the general fund?  What trillions of dollars? The federal deficit for fiscal year 2019 that ended last Sept. 30 was $984 billion. It has nearly quadrupled this year to a staggering $3.7 trillion, and this will skyrocket even further if another round of pandemic aid gets passed. These sums — so vast as to be nearly incomprehensible — get added on to the national debt, which as of last week was $26.6 trillion, up 33.6% on Trump’s watch. Remember: Trump said he would eliminate the entire national debt — not the deficit, the national debt itself — in eight years, because of all the brilliant trade deals he would do. Here we are four years later and things are worse, far worse, than ever. Other White House advisers, seeing the political damage this kind of talk has inflicted in a tough election race, have walked back plans to kill Social Security’s funding. And yet Trump’s words speak for themselves. All this loose talk is an insult to the tens of millions of Americans who are heavily dependent on Social Security (and Medicare too). “Heavily dependent” is not hyperbole. Consider some numbers: According to the Social Security Administration, the average monthly benefit for recipients this year is $1,503. As modest as this is, it represents just about everything — “90% or more” of all income received by “21% of married couples and about 45% of unmarried persons. It’s probably difficult for wealthy men like Trump, Mnuchin (who moonlights as the chief trustee of the Social Security Trust Fund) and others to see, but there is a vast sea of poverty in the United States. Click here to read a recent MarketWatch column I wrote about seniors and poverty. I’m talking about men and women — tens of millions of American workers — who paid into the system over their entire working lives. They deserve more respect than the Trump administration is showing them — and the assurance that the U.S. government will, without fail, honor the obligations it has made to them. Since Trump’s base skews older, it’s reasonable to assume that many of them, too, are overly dependent on Social Security. They, and everyone else, must understand that when the president talks about a payroll tax cut, it doesn’t mean what it seems. Paul Brandus is the White House bureau chief for West Wing Reports.

There were no obvious catalysts for the initial Tuesday decline, but the dollar’s continued weakness comes after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell last week made clear that policy makers would tolerate above-target inflation as part of a new policy-making framework that abandons the central bank’s previous bias toward pre-emptively hiking interest rates when the labor market gets tight and signs of potential inflationary pressures build. “With Chair Powell cementing the negative real yield narrative for the dollar, there is little to suggest the current U.S. dollar bear trend is to stop, wrote analysts Francesco Pesole and Petr Krpata of ING, in a note. A resulting pickup in inflation expectations has dropped real yields — the yield on U.S. Treasurys minus expected inflation — to all-time lows. The real yield on the 10-year Treasury note on Tuesday stood near -1.08% after hitting an all-time low of -1.11% on Monday. The negative expected return makes the dollar less attractive to investors. The adoption of average inflation targeting and a tolerance for an inflation overshoot suggests interest-rate hikes “are a very distant proposition” and that U.S. real interest rates will remain low and may go even lower if the Fed succeeds in generating domestic inflationary pressure, they said. “None of these should strategically bode well for the dollar,” the analysts wrote, noting that high nominal and real rates were the key ingredients behind a stronger dollar in recent years. The dollar’s slide has been under way since spring, with the currency dropping back sharply after running to a more than three-year high in March as the pandemic-induced global economic collapse and accompanying financial market turmoil sparked a global scramble for dollars. As financial markets stabilized and central banks, particularly the Fed, stepped in to provide aggressive monetary stimulus alongside fiscal efforts by governments, the dollar has retreated. The Fed also moved to quench the global thirst for dollars by enhancing existing currency swap lines with major central banks and opening new ones. The dollar’s decline began to pick up steam in the summer, with the DXY falling 4% in July for its biggest one-month drop in nearly a decade. The dollar’s drop from its pandemic peak was already being attributed to falling U.S. real yields and expectations the global economy was poised to outperform the U.S. as the pandemic eventually runs its course. “The dollar cycle has turned because real yields have collapsed, in absolute and relative terms, and because the U.S. growth advantage relative to other major economies has been diminished,” said Kit Juckes, global macro strategist at Société Générale, in a Tuesday note. Related: Dollar could become a ‘crash risk’ if U.S. loses credibility, analyst warns Commodities are also seen benefiting from a weaker dollar, as it makes assets denominated in the unit cheaper to users of other currencies. Juckes argued, however, that last week’s Fed move was relatively “modest” after the policy makers in March proved their willingness to go far beyond what previous officials had done. Market participants, however, have embraced the policy changes without asking important questions, he said. Ahead of last week’s announcement, the Fed had already pledged to keep interest rates lower for far longer than previously anticipated, he noted. And, Juckes added, while the Fed’s willingness to allow inflation to move above its target for a time is a significant step, there’s little attention paid to the fact that the Fed has so far been unable to push inflation up to its 2% target any more than the Bank of Japan or the European Central Bank. “The currency has moved further than the shift in growth expectations so far would seem to justify,” he said, while bets on a falling dollar have pushed speculative positioning to an extreme, though “when that triggers a correction isn’t easily forecastable. ” The big tech winners since the March low will be replaced by stocks in other sectors, says Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.

    "text": "That’s Mohamed El-Erian,  Allianz’s chief economic adviser,  explaining in an op-ed for the Financial Times how action in the options pits should be taken as a warning by retail investors who have been cashing in on the stock market’s relentless push higher in recent months. “The seemingly endless rally… gives the impression that prices are endorsed and supported by the entire professional investment community,” he said.  “After all, despite the vocal concerns over valuations having split away from underlying corporate and economic fundamentals, few fund managers have been willing to challenge the market by placing outright shorts. “ However, “sophisticated investors” are expressing their cautious views with the use of derivatives, and El-Erian says the mom-and-pop types should take note. “Much of this could be seen as market deepening were it not for one troubling fact: corporate and economic fundamentals have yet to reflect a sustained and convincing recovery from COVID-related damage,” he said. The rebound in consumption is slowing, initial jobless claims are back to the 1 million level for a second straight week, bankruptcies are rising, and, according to El-Erian, it’s looking like these short-term disruptions are about to become long-term scars. “Rather than a well-thought-out bet on the future, stocks reflect many investors’ resolute faith in a consistently favourable and predictable liquidity environment,” he wrote. “It is a backdrop anchored by reliable stimulus from central banks.” On the surface, the same can pretty much be said for what we’re seeing in the derivatives market, but there’s more to it than just that. “The fear of missing out on an unceasing equity rally has increasingly been expressed through call options,” El-Erian said. “Those who would normally short the market on concerns of excessive valuations appear to have no desire to be steamrollered once again by favourable liquidity and the strong ‘buy-the-dip’ conditioning that comes with that.” “It would take a big shock for markets to move significantly lower — such as a renewed sharp economic downturn, a considerable monetary or fiscal policy mistake, or market defaults and liquidity accidents,” he wrote. “But should such a move occur, the likelihood of further market turmoil would be high, especially given the current lack of a short base to buffer the downturn. This exposes small retail investors to big potential losses.” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is getting heat over a solo hair salon visit in San Francisco at a time when California businesses are limited by concern over coronavirus.

    "text": "Deal talks for TikTok’s U.S. operations have hit a snag over the key question of whether the app’s core algorithms can be included as part of a deal, according to people familiar with the matter. The algorithms, which determine the videos served to users and are seen as TikTok’s secret sauce, were considered part of the deal negotiations up until Friday, when the Chinese government issued new restrictions on the export of artificial-intelligence technology, according to people familiar with the matter. Now both sides are trying to figure out whether the order means the algorithms need Chinese government approval for transfer, and if so, whether Beijing would sign off. The complexity involved has reduced the chances that a deal could be completed any time soon. TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance Ltd., has said it will comply with the Chinese government order, and is trying to get clarity from Beijing on how to proceed with a sale if the new restrictions apply to its algorithms, some of the people said. For bidders, the idea of buying TikTok without the algorithms completely changes the outlook on what the companies are bidding for, other people familiar with the situation said. They believe a large portion of the value of TikTok is in the suggestion algorithms that keep users glued to the app. An expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.

    "text": "Google will pass on the cost of new European digital taxes to advertisers, incorporating these fees into its rates instead of paying them out of pocket. All three countries have instituted digital taxes within the last year, in an attempt to capture more of the revenues that technology giants generate within their borders. But investors worried that these digital taxes would hit Google’s bottom line will be relieved to hear that advertisers will bear the costs instead. Phil Smith, the director general of the ISBA, which represents British advertisers, said the move was “the inevitable outcome of the U.K.’s unilateral approach to digital taxation.” Starting November 1, a 2% fee will be added to invoices in the U.K., while customers in Austria and Turkey will have to pay a 5% fee on top of regular ad rates. These fees explicitly cover the cost of digital services taxes in the U.K. and Austria, and for Turkish customers represent “the complexity and cost of complying with regulations.” For now, Google won’t be extending fees covering digital taxes to all European countries that have imposed them, such as in France, which has committed to taxing tech giants this year regardless of whether an international tax standard for big tech is reached. Despite being relatively isolated from the economic impacts of the coronavirus pandemic, Google and Amazon have taken these fee decisions to protect their finances. Google’s revenues in the second quarter of 2020 remain only marginally lower than the year before, while Amazon’s share price is up over 48% year-to-date. Meanwhile, the advertising sector is in a rut, with marketing budgets being slashed across the board as companies cut costs to meet the economic challenges of the pandemic. “Digital service taxes and other regulations increase the cost of digital advertising. Typically, these kinds of cost increases are borne by customers,” a Google spokesperson said. “We’ll also continue to encourage governments globally to focus on international tax reform rather than implementing new, unilateral levies.” Opinion: Why the U.K. and France play against type in digital tax row with the U.S. Rudy Giuliani offers his perspective to Fox News on rising concerns that the police disproportionately kill black Americans.

    "text": "The 2020 election race between incumbent President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden is a coin toss,  LPL financial chief market strategist Ryan Detrick says. Indeed, a number of polls and betting odds indicate that a once-yawning lead enjoyed by Biden is starting to wane. Real Clear Politics shows that the Democratic nominee is leading Trump by 6.2 percentage points, based on an average of national polls, and his advantage in so-called battleground states, stands at a relatively razor-thin margin of 2.7 percentage points, according to a separate RCP poll average. But Detrick says that a simple equity-market chart has been the best predictor of U.S. presidential elections since 1984, proving 100% accurate—and is 87% accurate since 1928. The LPL analyst says that a chart of the S&P 500’s performance in the three-month period ahead of Election Day, which is Nov. 3 this year, has proven accurate over the past nearly four decades. Detrick writes that a positive return over that three-month period “may signal an increased likelihood that the incumbent party may win, while stock market losses during the same period have tended to predict an opposition party win.” To be sure, the strategist acknowledges that the market isn’t the economy and that millions of people are out of work due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, but notes that a look at what stocks may say about the outcome of election may be one thing for investor to consider as they prepare for an uncertain stretch of trade ahead of that key vote. “The unique circumstances around this year’s pandemic seem to add plausibility that this could be the first time in almost 100 years that this signal may be wrong—especially if the stock market and economy continue to recover between now and Election Day,” he wrote. All that said, Detrick said that Trump is still contending with an even bigger factor that could stymie his re-election chances beyond the stock-market gains: a recession. “History has shown that when a recession has occurred during the two years before the election, the incumbent president has tended to lose,” the analysts wrote. “ In fact, the economy incredibly has predicted the winner of every presidential election going back to President Calvin Coolidge,” he added. That statistic also offers its own inherent caveat since the recession that ensued in this pandemic is a global one and occurred a stunning and historic rate. But the president’s handling of the current pandemic and the ensuing public-health crisis may be the one thing that voters weigh against or in favor of Trump. MarketWatch columnist Mark Hulbert, in an article on Tuesday pointing out the fallibility of trying to spot correlations between stock performance and election outcomes, says that investors should “be on your guard…for those using the stock market to predict who will win the White House in November.” Notably, he says that the historical data can be contorted to say a number of things but also that the range period, including a three-month stretch before the election, is arbitrary and should raise a caution for observers. Biden condemns rioting, Massachusetts votes in closely watched Democratic primaries, Trump official reportedly wants the U.S. to adopt “herd immunity,” and other news to start your day.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-what-to-know-about-abbotts-15-minute-covid-19-test-11598982464?mod=home-page",
    "text": "On Aug. 26, the Food and Drug Administration granted an Emergency Use Authorization to a new rapid antigen test for COVID-19 called the BinaxNOW test. I study public health policy to combat infectious disease epidemics. Testing is one of the most powerful tools available to fight the spread of COVID-19. The new test is inexpensive, rapid and easy to use. It will massively scale up access to testing, but hurdles remain in achieving widespread, frequent COVID-19 testing. The credit-card-sized test is an antigen test that detects a specific viral protein from SARS-CoV-2. It costs $5 and doesn’t require a lab or a machine for processing. Performing the test is simple. A health-care worker or technician would use a swab to collect a sample from less than 1 inch inside the nostril. They would then combine the sample with a few drops of chemicals inside the test card. Within 15 minutes, the test strip would show a positive or negative result. The test is also paired with an app that produces a digital code that can be scanned to show proof of a recent negative COVID-19 test. The BinaxNOW test is currently only authorized for patients who have had COVID-19 symptoms for seven days or less, which is when virus levels in the body are likely to be high. It must be prescribed by a physician and performed by a trained technicianor other health-care worker. The PCR test for COVID-19 is currently widely used and considered the gold standard, but requires patient samples to be sent to a lab and can take days to provide results. The new antigen test is designed to be a cheap and quick alternative to PCR testing for diagnostic purposes in a medical setting. It would add critical capacity to an overstretched testing system. The emergency use authorization provides preliminary authorization for doctors to prescribe the antigen test while the full FDA approval process is ongoing. The authorization could be revoked if the test is not as accurate or reliable as expected. However, the true accuracy could be lower because the performance testing group was only 102 people and the accuracy hasn’t been validated by the FDA as part of the full approval process. There will inevitably be some false negatives and false positives with the BinaxNOW test since accuracy isn’t 100%, but the FDA will monitor the data to make sure the test meets the reported accuracy. The BinaxNOW test is cheap, rapid, able to be mass-produced and easy to use outside a lab. This makes it a promising candidate for widespread screening. However, the test is currently only authorized for people with COVID-19 symptoms. This is an obstacle because an estimated 40% of all COVID-19 cases are asymptomatic and these people likely don’t know that they’re contagious. To maximize the effectiveness of any COVID-19 screening program, it is important to test people whether they have symptoms or not. Health-care providers are able to prescribe the BinaxNOW test for asymptomatic patients for off-label use, but health officials don’t yet know how accurate the test is when performed on asymptomatic people. The massive expansion of testing access made possible by the BinaxNOW test will almost surely outweigh the downsides of a small number of inaccurate results. Abbott plans to manufacture 50 million tests per month starting in October. This will quickly exceed the 76 million COVID-19 tests the U.S. has performed over the last six months. Widespread, frequent testing is effective at slowing the spread of the coronavirus. The new testing capacity made possible by the authorization of this rapid antigen test represents a major advance in bringing the pandemic under control.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/an-experts-guide-to-road-tripping-with-your-dog-2020-09-02?mod=home-page",
    "text": "Even in the heart of a COVID-19 pandemic…make that especially in the heart of a COVID-19 pandemic, the summer road trip is a traditional taste of freedom that’s been celebrated since the automobile was invented. Inviting your dog to join you on these highway adventures makes you a much better person (just ask your pup). Keep in mind, however, that it’s going to take a little bit of planning. Nothing major, just some smart forethought and consideration for your 4-legged traveling companion. If you’re reading this story on your phone as your road-trip vehicle idles in the driveway, your dog in the seat next to you and you’re waiting for the Sherpas to finish packing the car, stop. You’ll still have a great road trip, but you should have started thinking through this journey with the dog a few weeks earlier. That’s when you would have gathered your pooch’s essential traveling tools like vaccination records, medicines, and a current dog tag with your mobile number on it. Of course, your dog has an ID microchip implanted because you love him/her, right? OK, be sure that the chip number is loaded into your smartphone. A pre-trip trip to the vet isn’t a bad idea either just to make sure everything is in order. And vet runs are always good practice for how well a dog travels. Another important pre-road trip consideration is which vehicle to take. If you’re a one-car family, of course, that’s academic. But if you have a choice, choose the SUV that has AC vents in back (your dog will worship you if you can get cooling air to the rear seats where most road trip dogs travel). Summer heat is unforgiving, especially to canines. Although SUVs work best for road trips with dogs — lots of extra gear comes along — cars will work just fine, too, and you won’t get any complaints out of Muttley either way. The important thing is to try to keep the second row — aka, the back seat — clear of luggage and gear so that your dog can take ownership of the space and feel secure in it. Leather seating cleans easier, but if you’re a big-dog owner, make sure you protect the rear seat from scratching nails with a pet hammock seat cover designed to keep your dog safe and protect the seat from natural pet behavior. It’ll also make cleaning up after the trip — dogs are dogs and they never learn to clean up their rooms, after all — infinitely easier. Other essentials to prep before you go are a no-spill water dish, treats (of course), toys (of course, of course), and a few items from home that carry your scent to comfort him, like a favorite blanket or even your pup’s bed. Don’t forget to pack food (pack about 15%t extra for travel) and food bowls. If you plan on camping or hiking, a first aid kit designed specifically for dogs is a good addition to your list. All you have to do now is get your dog’s Instagram account set up and you’re ready to travel. 1. I’m thirsty. 2. I have to pee. These sweetly ironic rules should come as no surprise. Water helps dogs function, flush toxins, regulate body temperature, and keep noses wet for optimal sniffin’. And it keeps them peeing throughout the day. When you’re on the road with a canine companion, always keep those two facts in mind as priorities. Pee stops are a good chance to get a little exercise, too, for both the dog and the driver. Speaking of exercise, no matter where you are on the journey, don’t hesitate to ask your smartphone for the location of the nearest dog park (every city and town has at least one) or if you’re doing a coastal trip, a dog beach. Both of these places are great shared communities where the natural practice is to stay at least 6 feet apart without seeming unfriendly. That’s true all across America, from the Union Square Dog Run in Manhattan to the Cayucos Dog Beach along California’s Highway 1. Plus, a worked out, sleeping dog travels best. Camping with dogs is a special kind of blast. These days, however, motels (and many hotels) seem to be getting more dog-friendly than ever. It’s easy to find a place where your tail-wagger can bunk with you free or for a very small fee. Many restaurants, too, especially now that coronavirus has forced so many dining establishments to expand their outdoor seating, are happy to accommodate with a big smile, a full menu and a fresh bowl of water for Fido. A road trip seen through eyes of a dog keeps car travel fresh. It may not always be super simple, but it is always rewarding and guaranteed to bring you and your companions, human and nonhuman, closer together. Treat every meal, motel stay and pee stop as a teaching and learning moment — a chance to refine your pup’s already stellar behavior. So relax and go have fun. If you and your dog have found a rhythm together at home, you’ll absolutely find one on the road.

    "text": "At the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, close to eight of 10 MBA students say they are not excited about the coming fall semester because the coronavirus pandemic has forced classes online. At UCLA’s Anderson School of Management, newly admitted international students are outraged that they cannot defer their admission to the school’s MBA program even if they cannot get a student visa to come to the U.S. At New York University’s Stern School of Business, students are demanding the reversal of a 3.5% increase in MBA tuition during COVID-19 and asking for a 5% to 10% discount on the price of their degrees because of the shift to virtual classes. Add to all of the anxiety and frustration the fact that some graduates from the most prestigious business schools, including Harvard and Stanford universities, saw their summer internships and full-time job offers clawed back by companies due to the COVID recession. Many more are deeply worried about their prospects for landing a job over the next year as still more companies freeze budgets and hiring plans. So is this a time to apply to an MBA program and go even further into debt? You better believe it is, and here’s why. A recession and a health crisis, no matter how severe, will not last forever. But while it lasts, many will find their opportunities to advance at work diminished or completely curtailed. Many more have already found themselves on unemployment. By the time this year’s incoming MBA students graduate in 2023, it is almost a certainty that both COVID-19 and the economic downturn will be in the rearview mirror. The Class of 2023 will inevitably graduate into a fully recovered economy, better prepared to take full advantage of the upturn. No less crucial, they will have been the beneficiaries of not merely the business basics or of the leadership development a strong MBA program provides; they will be steeped in both data analytics, specifically how to smartly harness massive datasets for decision making, and how to leverage new technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, to gain important efficiencies in a business moving forward. Of all the graduate degrees you could earn, an MBA from a highly selective business school is pretty much a no-brainer investment. The top five schools for average starting pay last year — base salary plus signing bonus — are all big names, led by the Wharton School at $172,016, NYU Stern ($168,291), Stanford ($168,226), Dartmouth College’s Tuck School of Business ($166,251), and the University of Virginia’s Darden School of Business ($165,292). In all, 12 schools in the top 25 of U.S. News’s MBA ranking report starting salaries above $160,000, and 17 above $150,000. “If you stayed at work in 2021, your career options and earning potential in 2023 would be more limited if you had gone to business school,” noted Soojin Kwon, managing director of full-time MBA admissions and program at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business. Why? Kwon notes that students will gain three advantages by going back to school that they won’t get by staying in a job during the pandemic. “One, you’ll meet with and learn from hundreds of smart, ambitious and interesting people you wouldn’t have met if you didn’t go to business school,” Kwon said at a recent panel discussion for Poets & Quants.  “Two, you’re going to learn how to network and interview for jobs in an industry or function that you’re interested in going into, and most, if not all MBA recruiters this year are planning to do virtual recruiting. So you’re going to learn how to interview in the format in which recruiters are going to be recruiting. In addition, she said, “You’re going to gain access to a network of tens of thousands of business school alumni and hundreds of thousands of alumni in the broader university community. You could absolutely find another job through LinkedIn, but it’s no secret that you’re more likely to get a response if you have some kind of connection, and an MBA from a top school with the support of alumni provides that invaluable connection for life.” During the Great Recession of 2008-2009, the job situation was just as miserable and prospects for many MBAs appeared so dim that some openly questioned their decision to borrow money to get the degree. Robert Bruner, then dean of the University of Virginia’s Darden School of Business, found himself having to defend the value of the MBA. He rose to the challenge, and his points then made much sense now. Education adds significant value to human potential. “Generally, research finds real rates of return on investment upwards of 10% and as high as 50%. And there is a correlation between years in school and earning power but that’s only the quantitative part. Every year, students graduate who are more self-confident, better communicators, and more promising leaders than when they enrolled. And they have joined an alumni network that has helped in good times and bad.” Indeed, long-term thinking beats short-term thinking all the time. Young professionals have a long career ahead of them. “With the benefits of modern medicine, you can probably look forward to a career of 50 years,” Bruner wrote. “Are you judging the worth of an MBA by only the first job you get out of B-school? Take the long view. If you could discount the marginal benefits of an MBA from a competitive school over the next 50 years, I’d guess that they well exceed the costs. Don’t discount the future too steeply.” Truth is, you can bet with certainty that tough times will again appear once this pandemic is under control and the economy recovers. The ability to assess and bear sensible risks is the core of business and entrepreneurship. Pursuing a graduate degree in business to learn valuable skills, cultivate one’s leadership potential, and acquire a supportive network of connected professionals is a risk worth taking. John A.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/uk-house-prices-surge-to-all-time-high-in-august-2020-09-02?mod=home-page",
    "text": "House prices in the U.K. surged to an all-time high in August, fueled by pent-up demand and record low mortgage rates, according to new figures from Nationwide. Britain’s biggest building society said prices jumped by 2% in August, following a 1.8% rise in July, marking the highest monthly increase since February 2004. Annual house price growth jumped to 3.7% last month from 1.5% in July. The average price was £224,123 ($298,864) in August, up from just under £170,000 10 years ago, Nationwide said. Robert Gardner, Nationwide’s chief economist, said the bounce back in prices reflects the unexpectedly rapid recovery in housing market activity since the easing of lockdown restrictions. “This rebound reflects a number of factors. Pent-up demand is coming through, where decisions taken to move before lockdown are progressing. Behavioral shifts may also be boosting activity, as people reassess their housing needs and preferences as a result of life in lockdown,” he said. The housing market was hit hard in March at the height of the lockdown, as estate agents were forced to close their offices and viewings weren’t allowed. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the next few months are crucial for Barratt because, while the group demonstrated its strength during the lockdown, an extended recession would prove an even tougher test. “The taxpayer funded furlough scheme, mortgage holidays and a ban on evictions are all due to be unwound in the autumn, which all could have major implications on demand for housing going forward,” she said. Read:U.K. jobs picture looks bleak with 7.5 million furloughed or away from their job Shares in Barratt rose 6.91% in early morning London trading. Gardner said that the trends look set to continue in the near term, further boosted by Chancellor Rishi Sunak’s recently announced stamp duty holiday — the transfer tax paid when buying a home. However, Gardner cautioned that most forecasters expect labor market conditions to weaken significantly in the quarters ahead, as a result of the after effects of the pandemic and as government support schemes wind down. “If this comes to pass, it would likely dampen housing activity once again in the quarters ahead,” Gardner said. Shares of DocuSign Inc.  are up more than 16% in Tuesday morning trading after Zoom Video Communications Inc.  reported July-quarter results showing that it made more than four times as much revenue as it did a year ago. Zoom's earnings, which topped expectations, suggested that technologies enabling remote business functions are still seeing explosive growth due to the pandemic. DocuSign, which enables electronic signatures on legal documents, is due to report its own results after Thursday's closing bell. Shares of workplace-messaging company Slack Inc.  is also seeing its stock rise more than 3% in Tuesday's session. Zoom shares are up more than 45% in the session and they'e gained nearly 600% on the year as the S&P 500  has risen 8.6%.

    "text": "So much for playing videogames to escape reality — the 2020 U.S. presidential election has now even infiltrated “Animal Crossing.” Yes, the millions of people playing “Animal Crossing: New Horizons” since it was released for the Nintendo Switch in March, in which players build their own virtual islands populated by cute critters, can now add Joe Biden campaign signs to their digital front yards. Biden’s presidential campaign revealed its “Animal Crossing” partnership on Tuesday. “Show your Biden/Harris pride virtually!” it declared on its official campaign store, along with QR codes for players to scan and add the free political insignia all over their islands. The designs include the official Biden-Harris logo, a Team Joe logo, a “Joe” Pride logo, as well as a print of three aviator sunglasses in red, white and blue. “’Animal Crossing’ is a dynamic, diverse, and powerful platform that brings communities together from across the world,” Christian Tom, director of digital partnerships for the Biden campaign, said in a statement. “It is an exciting new opportunity for our campaign to engage and connect Biden-Harris supporters as they build and decorate their islands.” And the virtual campaign signs fit into the Biden camp’s pandemic playbook of hosting more online events, live-streamed fundraisers and speeches, while Trump has continued to campaign in person. Reps from Nintendo did not immediately respond to a MarketWatch query about whether the Biden campaign had to pay for those virtual signs to be available in the “Animal Crossing” game. Trump’s reelection campaign has not officially created campaign signs or T-shirts for “Animal Crossing,” although players can make their own — and in fact, have already done so. There are Trump and MAGA insignia on many individuals’ islands. CNN noted that, so far, there actually appear to be a few dozen more “MAGA” and “Trump” designs created by “Animal Crossing” gamers than Biden designs. Trump campaign deputy national press secretary Samantha Zager mocked Biden’s videogame gambit on Tuesday. “This explains everything: Joe Biden thinks he’s campaigning for president of ‘Animal Crossing’ from his basement,” she told CNN. “The Trump campaign will continue to spend its resources campaigning in the real world with real Americans.” Many people on social media also groaned at the Biden campaign’s “Animal Crossing” signs, as well, recalling Hillary Clinton calling on voters to “Pokemon Go to the polls” while she was running against Trump in 2016, citing another Nintendo gaming title. This isn’t the first time that political movements have made a mark in “Animal Crossing,” however. Players have also added Black Lives Matter flags and T-shirts to the game. Rudy Giuliani offers his perspective to Fox News on rising concerns that the police disproportionately kill black Americans. Copyright © 2020 MarketWatch, Inc. All rights reserved."

    "text": "Nvidia Corp.’s stock closed at a record Tuesday as the chip company launched its new line of gaming cards and detailed more videogames that are taking advantage of the ray-tracing technology that was introduced in the previous line of graphics-processing units. Huang announced the new chips in a YouTube video Tuesday morning, similar to his announcement of new Ampere-based server chips in May. The new cards build upon Turing architecture, which brought real-time ray tracing — the rendering of realistic-looking lighting and shading — to the fore. But when RTX ray tracing made its appearance two years ago, critics argued that developers were slow in putting out enough games that took advantage of the technology. Nvidia said the RTX 3080 will be available Sept. 17, with the RTX 3090 available Sept. 24, and the RTX 3070 “sometime” in October. That will give the company about six weeks of sales of the new cards before Nvidia’s fiscal third quarter finishes up at the end of October. Nvidia said the $499 RTX 3070 runs faster than its $1,199 RTX 2080 Ti, which is currently listed as out of stock, and up to 60% faster than its original RTX 2070, which was $499 when Nvidia launched its 20-series of Turing-architecture gaming cards two years ago. The upgrade to the RTX 2070, or the “Super” version that came out in July 2019, last listed at $499. Similarly, the mid-tier $699 RTX 3080 is up to two times faster than the RTX 2080, Nvidia said. The “Super” version of the 2080 card last listed at $699. At the high end, however, Nvidia appears to be offering a deep discount on improved performance. The company said its $1,499 RTX 3090 runs up to 50% faster and 10 times quieter than its flagship Titan RTX, which last listed at $2,499. Huang said demand for the limited-run Titan “surprised us” as filmmakers were using the Titan to make 4K movies, bloggers used it to build broadcast workstations, and others used the card for applications that required its power. “There is clearly a need for a giant GPU that is available all over the world, so we made a giant Ampere,” Huang said in his presentation. Nvidia would not comment on whether it would lower prices on its 20-series Turing cards. As of market close on Tuesday, the company had yet to change 20-series card pricing on its website, and was still offering its RTX 2060 Super card at $399. Less than two weeks ago, Nvidia execs talked a lot about gaming on the company’s earnings conference call even though data-center sales had surpassed gaming for the first time ever, with Huang forecasting “this may very well be one of the best gaming seasons ever.” There is an old Wall Street saying that investing isn’t about being right or wrong, it’s about making money.

    "text": "The German Bundestag decided on Tuesday to launch a full inquiry into the downfall of payment company Wirecard, which filed for insolvency in June after €1.9 billion in cash were found to be missing from its accounts. Lawmakers want to probe possible government failures to uncover the scandal even as evidence accumulated over the last year. - Wirecard’s former chief executive Markus Braun is in custody on accusations of running a criminal enterprise that defrauded creditors of €3.2 billion. Braun and other Wirecard executives deny any wrongdoing. The company’s former chief operating officer, Jan Marsalek, has fled Germany and his whereabouts is unknown. - Both finance minister Olaf Scholz and Germany’s top financial regulator, BaFin, have been accused of turning a blind eye to Wirecard’s problems, first reported by the Financial Times in January, 2019, because the company was seen as a German fintech success story. BaFin even originally filed criminal complaints against the journalists who first uncovered the fraud. - “A picture has emerged that those fraudsters had it pretty easy,” said Florian Toncar, an opposition MP from the centrist Free Democratic Party. Lawmakers notably want to establish why Chancellor Angela Merkel lobbied for Wirecard during a trip to China in September, 2019, even as allegations of dubious accounting had already surfaced. The outlook: The inquiry could prove embarrassing for the two ruling coalition parties, Merkel’s conservative CDU and Scholz’s social-democratic SPD, one year before the general election scheduled in the fall of 2021. But the impact on the political careers of both parties’ leaders won’t be the same: Merkel is retiring next year, whereas Scholz will be running as his party’s candidate for the chancellor job.

    "title": "This university created its own COVID-19 test and is testing students twice a week — but is it enough to prevent an outbreak?",
    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-university-created-its-own-covid-19-test-and-is-testing-students-twice-a-week-experts-are-watching-to-see-if-its-enough-to-prevent-an-outbreak-11598648724?mod=home-page",
    "text": "Over the roughly week and a half that Ian Katsnelson has been back at his college, the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, the junior has developed a “mini competition” with his friends to see who can finish the process of taking their COVID-19 tests the fastest. “The hardest part for sure is garnering enough saliva,” Katsnelson said of the rapid saliva test, which was created by scientists at the school. He’s perfecting his strategy for his trips to the tents where testing takes place: “I’ve built up my saliva in line before I’ve even gotten inside the tent, so I can get in and get out real quick.” Hallie Workman, a PhD candidate in communications at U of I said, “there’s a lot of scouting that goes on” as students try to find out which of the more than a dozen testing tents on campus have the shortest line. “I have my tent in my time of day that always works well,” Workman, 30, said. “You just sit there trying not to make eye contact with people as you dribble spit into a tube.” These were just some of the rituals that marked an unusual first week of classes at the University of Illinois, which is requiring students, faculty and staff accessing campus to get tested for COVID-19 twice a week as part of its reopening plan. As colleges across the country have sent students home or back to remote classes amid COVID outbreaks, officials at the University of Illinois are hopeful that their approach to mitigating the pandemic’s spread on campus — which includes a test developed at the school that is now being performed under the Federal Drug Administration’s emergency use authorization — will be enough to keep students in some in-person classes through November.  It’s not a small undertaking. The school had 51,000 students in the fall of 2019. Since July 6, the school has processed 121,333 COVID tests and in the five days leading up to Friday, which marked the end of the first week of classes, the school administered 47,075 tests and had a 0.75% positivity rate. For context, there were roughly 730,000 COVID tests administered in the entire U.S. on a recent August day, according to Johns Hopkins University’s Coronavirus Resource Center. On Aug. 24, U of I administered more than 17,000 tests alone. So far, the number of positive cases is in line with what the school’s modelers predicted — well under 400 cases in the week before classes began. The next couple of weeks will be a “defining moment” for U of I as it works to prevent the spread of COVID-19 on campus and in the community, said Robert Jones, the school’s chancellor. “We know that people are watching,” he told MarketWatch. And indeed, according to Joshua Salomon, the director of the Prevention Policy Modeling Lab at Stanford University, “people are really going to be watching this carefully,” describing the efforts the school has taken as “encouraging.” “We don’t know whether it’s going to succeed,” he added. “What we do know is that the likelihood of succeeding without testing is very small.” At many universities that have reopened their campuses for in-person instruction, students may have been tested upon reentry to university housing or campus more broadly and may be subject to random screening. But models from researchers at Yale School of Public Health and U of I, indicate that in order to prevent an outbreak on a college campus — and not just monitor one — students and those interacting with them regularly need to be tested multiple times per week. U of I may be the only university in the country hewing to that standard. Officials will know around Sept. 25, one month and one day after the start of classes, if their efforts have worked, said Rebecca Lee Smith, an associate professor of pathobiology at U of I who is part of the team that developed the school’s testing and other protocols. “We’re going to be keeping track of how well we’re doing going from test results to isolation to contact tracing and quarantine,” Smith said. They’ll also be looking out for new positive cases, a sign of community spread. The outcome that they’re hoping for “is to minimize the infections, get it under control and to protect the health of campus and the community,” Smith said. The school began working to prepare for the fall semester shortly after classes went remote in the spring, said Martin Burke, a chemistry professor at the University of Illinois and chair of the SHIELD committee, the team that is guiding the university’s approach to reopening. They realized relatively quickly that in order to bring students back to campus, they would need to test frequently and get results back rapidly, something that wasn’t going to be possible with a nasal swab test. That led to what Burke described as a “Manhattan Project-style effort,” at the university  to develop their own test. Ultimately they were able to do so in about six weeks, he said. Now the school is working to expand access to the test to the rest of the state of Illinois and even to other areas of the country and around the world. “Testing is not a silver bullet, but it’s a very powerful component,” Burke said. In addition to the testing, the school developed an app where students, faculty and staff receive test results and reminders, and a boarding pass-style image indicating a negative COVID test that allow them access to campus buildings. Users can also enable the app to notify them when they’ve been in close proximity to someone who tested positive for COVID through the use of an anonymized Bluetooth scanning system. U of I is also taking many of the same steps as other campuses  — moving large lecture courses online, moving smaller in-person courses to large rooms to allow for social distancing and requiring masks. The school also has “every high expectation” of students, Jones said. “By agreeing to come back and be here that they have to take ownership to keep themselves safe.” Those who are participating in on-campus activities and don’t follow testing and isolation guidelines could be subject to student discipline. For a university to have a shot at reopening successfully, it needs to hold classes online or outside when possible, have a good system for testing and contact tracing, and have clear and transparent metrics for when it will change course, Salomon said. (Asked about what would trigger a move to remote instruction, Jones said “one of the key metrics, we’re keeping our eye on is the number of positive cases.”) All of these are costly  and administratively challenging undertakings. Jones said his best “guesstimate” is that the school’s testing component alone will cost $7 to $10 million per semester. But a major obstacle to any successful reopening, is just the status of the spread of the virus itself, Salomon said. “We’re still very much in the middle of a raging pandemic,” he said. “With that amount of transmission in communities and bringing together students from around the country, we know that there will be people infected upon arrival. It raises the bar on what needs to be done to interrupt transmission and cut it off.” During the first week of classes, when the school onboarded tens of thousands of students, “the main hiccup” in its system was turning test results around fast enough so that students, faculty and staff would have access to buildings they needed to be in for class, Smith said. Those who haven’t had a negative test result in the last four days can’t get into university buildings, except their own residence hall. Still, the school has been turning test results around “well within” the 48 hour window they’ve promised, she said. Workman was one of those affected by the hiccup. She got tested on a Monday, which was one of the testing days assigned to her by the school, but didn’t get her results back in time to teach her 8 a.m. Tuesday class in person. She “had to call an audible and tell my class we were meeting on Zoom.” When the two public speaking classes she was teaching started last week, roughly 5% of her students couldn’t attend because they’d tested positive for the virus, Workman said. That’s one metric Workman said she’ll be keeping an eye on as she evaluates whether to keep teaching in person. If enough students can’t attend class face-to-face because of quarantine or isolation, she’ll transition to remote instruction, though her preference is to continue teaching in-person classes — the widespread testing has made her feel comfortable doing so. Owen Stephenson was eager to come to campus for his freshman year to gain some independence, even if he would be taking most of his classes online. So far, he’s felt like the testing has gone smoothly; he received his first two test results on the same day he tested and his only quibble was a 45-minute wait on a weekend, when there are fewer testing tents available. The required testing is part of what makes Stephenson feel like he can keep himself safe, regardless of other students’ behavior. “Their testing is the only thing that sets them apart from other universities trying to go back,” he said of U of I’s plan. From her observations in class, Workman said it seems as if students are committed to making the school’s reopening program work because they want to stick around for the semester. Still, she said, the changes to the college experience required during this time — more rules for engaging on campus, more online courses than typical — have left her students so drained that she ended a recent class 20 minutes early. “They had this feeling that once they were finally able to get back on campus, that life would feel more normal and it’s not.” MBA holders will be in demand in the post-pandemic global economy.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/a-lung-doctor-on-what-shes-learning-about-coronavirus-long-haulers-shortness-of-breath-and-fatigue-and-depression-but-also-improvement-over-time-2020-08-26?mod=home-page",
    "text": "This interview is the third in a series of conversations MarketWatch is conducting with some of the leading voices in the U.S. on the COVID-19 pandemic. Back in April, Dr. Dixie Harris and about 100 nurses and doctors from the Intermountain Healthcare hospital system in Utah flew to New York City to work in the region’s overburdened hospitals. Harris, a pulmonologist who studies e-cigarette vaping, worked for days in a row, caring for COVID-19 patients when the region’s local hospitals were overwhelmed. It was at Southside Hospital in Bay Shore, N.Y., that she started to learn about the virus, about why it’s better to put patients prone, why ventilators aren’t always the best option — and the importance of wearing a face mask. “One hundred of us went,” she said. “Zero came back positive.” Back home in the much more sparsely populated state of Utah, cases peaked at 876 on July 9, according to the Utah Department of Health. About 400 people in total have died as a result of a COVID-19 infection. (New York state has reported a total of 430,774 cases and 25,297 deaths as of Aug. 25.) As cases have declined, more of Harris’ focus has turned to patients who had COVID-19 in the spring and are still dealing with myriad health problems and symptoms months later. Many of these patients in the U.S. call themselves “long haulers.” They have reported fatigue, chest pain and neurological damage. “One of my first long-hauler patients had symptoms in March,” she said. “Five months later, and this patient was never in the hospital. That’s who I’m mostly seeing: patients who haven’t been in the hospital but continue to have ongoing symptoms.” Dr. Dixie Harris: We were there three weeks in April. It was pretty intense. It was right as the peak was going down, but there were still six times the number of ICU patients or more for the hospital I was working in. From what I could see, it hit pretty much within a week. It went from next to no COVID patients to overwhelming the whole system. I’ve had other people ask me, “Why didn’t they just ship some of those patients to another hospital?” Well, every hospital in Long Island was overrun with patients. And all the ambulances were so busy bringing new patients in, it’s not like they could say, “Oh, we’ll take this one patient all the way up to Albany. “ A tsunami is what they called it because there was no warning and it hit all at once. It was an incredibly dynamic learning environment. From when we started to when I left, care changed markedly. We were intubating early on. And then we said, “Wait a second, once they go on the ventilator, they’re on for three weeks. What can we do to avoid this?” The big key is proning. Even if you get some respiratory symptoms but you don’t have to be in the hospital, go ahead and move. Prone. Don’t just lay in the bed on your back at home. I will say it’s really hard to lay on your belly when your BMI is 45. When you’re really obese, it feels like you can’t breathe. So I tell the patients to sit up, lean forward. You’re trying to get the back upright. It was an honor to get to go there. The head of Northwell Health came when we were leaving about to get on the plane and came in to thank us. They did a water cannon salute in New York at the airport. When we were in the waiting area right at the jet way, probably 30, 40 people showed up and just gave us a shout-out clap. All wearing masks, all distanced. MarketWatch: It looks like Utah’s peak was in July. How is it different caring for patients there even now? Harris: We haven’t been overwhelmed. We have not had our ICUs completely full and so because of that we’re doing cutting edge best care possible. Every COVID patient is presented to infectious disease to decide which meds they qualify for. Harris: The laypeople are calling it long haulers. The British Medical Journal just did a nice review on management of post-acute COVID patients. They’re calling it long COVID. In the medical community, we haven’t fully named it. But I’m [also] aware of patients who consider themselves long haulers who have never (been) diagnosed positive for COVID. They feel they have it because they have the symptoms, the time frame, and all that. Harris: That’s really what we are just learning. Who I get are patients who two to three months later are still having shortness of breath, still having aches and pains, and maybe chest symptoms. Many of them are still on oxygen. Now mind you, we are at higher elevation. So some of these patients would not necessarily be hypoxic if they were at sea level. Still, these are people who are used to living here, so their body is adjusted to it. Dr. Kirk Knowlton, [Intermountain’s director of cardiovascular research, critical care physician Dr. Eliotte Hirshberg] and I are going to be talking to our leadership about developing protocols to take care of these patients. Part of it is to acknowledge that patients are still having symptoms. One of my first long-hauler patients had symptoms in March. I talked to the patient a week and a half ago, and he is still having a little bit of symptoms [but is] markedly better. Back to work now. But five months later, and this patient was never in the hospital. That’s who I’m mostly seeing: patients who haven’t been in the hospital but continue to have ongoing symptoms. In the BMJ article that just was published, they’re saying that 10% of patients who test positive remain unwell after three weeks. Their definition is if you have symptoms more than three weeks, you’re going into the long haulers. A lot of people are calling long haulers a month out. My colleague and I are presenting to our leadership — he’s a cardiologist, and I’m a pulmonologist — but we’re the ones who are aware of these cases two, three, four, or five months later. The fatigue and the memory issues. Depression. There’s a lot of non-pulmonary issues. Muscle aches. Anxiety. Everybody’s anxious in the day of COVID, right? Everybody’s stressed. Everybody’s had to adjust and learn. Primary care’s going to be addressing more and more of this. And our psychiatric services are going to be seeing this. My long haulers, most of them are on oxygen, and they all have pulmonary symptoms. But every time I see them, they’re a little bit better. I do see improvement over time. I will say that things such as prolonged symptoms — fatigue, that kind of thing — has been reported in MERS and SARS. MarketWatch: It’s not just a respiratory illness. Harris: Right. It’s a blood vessel illness. It’s a brain illness. It’s a muscle illness. MarketWatch: You’ve done some research around vaping and smoking. How do you talk to patients about these types of things in the context of COVID? Harris: It’s pretty well established that vaping nicotine does weaken the immune system. It especially affects how the nose can fight viruses. And how does COVID get in the system? Eyes, nose, mouth, right? You saw more cases of EVALI (e-cigarette, or vaping, product use associated lung injury) in April and May. A lot of the EVALI, like 90% to 95%, is due to the tainted THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) oil. [THC is the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis that makes people feel “high.”] I think people are going to THC with the stress of all the quarantines and all the changes. It makes sense people are reaching for that. Whatever you do, don’t vape the THC.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-what-to-know-about-abbotts-15-minute-covid-19-test-11598982464?mod=home-page",
    "text": "On Aug. 26, the Food and Drug Administration granted an Emergency Use Authorization to a new rapid antigen test for COVID-19 called the BinaxNOW test. I study public health policy to combat infectious disease epidemics. Testing is one of the most powerful tools available to fight the spread of COVID-19. The new test is inexpensive, rapid and easy to use. It will massively scale up access to testing, but hurdles remain in achieving widespread, frequent COVID-19 testing. The credit-card-sized test is an antigen test that detects a specific viral protein from SARS-CoV-2. It costs $5 and doesn’t require a lab or a machine for processing. Performing the test is simple. A health-care worker or technician would use a swab to collect a sample from less than 1 inch inside the nostril. They would then combine the sample with a few drops of chemicals inside the test card. Within 15 minutes, the test strip would show a positive or negative result. The test is also paired with an app that produces a digital code that can be scanned to show proof of a recent negative COVID-19 test. The BinaxNOW test is currently only authorized for patients who have had COVID-19 symptoms for seven days or less, which is when virus levels in the body are likely to be high. It must be prescribed by a physician and performed by a trained technicianor other health-care worker. The PCR test for COVID-19 is currently widely used and considered the gold standard, but requires patient samples to be sent to a lab and can take days to provide results. The new antigen test is designed to be a cheap and quick alternative to PCR testing for diagnostic purposes in a medical setting. It would add critical capacity to an overstretched testing system. The emergency use authorization provides preliminary authorization for doctors to prescribe the antigen test while the full FDA approval process is ongoing. The authorization could be revoked if the test is not as accurate or reliable as expected. However, the true accuracy could be lower because the performance testing group was only 102 people and the accuracy hasn’t been validated by the FDA as part of the full approval process. There will inevitably be some false negatives and false positives with the BinaxNOW test since accuracy isn’t 100%, but the FDA will monitor the data to make sure the test meets the reported accuracy. The BinaxNOW test is cheap, rapid, able to be mass-produced and easy to use outside a lab. This makes it a promising candidate for widespread screening. However, the test is currently only authorized for people with COVID-19 symptoms. This is an obstacle because an estimated 40% of all COVID-19 cases are asymptomatic and these people likely don’t know that they’re contagious. To maximize the effectiveness of any COVID-19 screening program, it is important to test people whether they have symptoms or not. Health-care providers are able to prescribe the BinaxNOW test for asymptomatic patients for off-label use, but health officials don’t yet know how accurate the test is when performed on asymptomatic people. The massive expansion of testing access made possible by the BinaxNOW test will almost surely outweigh the downsides of a small number of inaccurate results. Abbott plans to manufacture 50 million tests per month starting in October. This will quickly exceed the 76 million COVID-19 tests the U.S. has performed over the last six months. Widespread, frequent testing is effective at slowing the spread of the coronavirus. The new testing capacity made possible by the authorization of this rapid antigen test represents a major advance in bringing the pandemic under control. Zoë McLaren is an associate professor of public policy at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. This was first published by The Conversation — “Will the new 15-minute COVID-19 test solve US testing problems?“ Shares of General Electric Co.  dropped 4.3% in afternoon trading Monday, after J.P. Morgan analyst Stephen Tusa withdrew his price target, saying he's now \"more negative\" on the industrial conglomerate heading into the back-half of 2020. Tusa's price target was $5, which was tied for the lowest of the 21 analysts surveyed by FactSet, while he kept his rating at neutral. He said the fact that management has stopped short of calling for for positive free cash flow (FCF) during the second half of the year, despite Wall Street expectations of a V-shaped recovery that has FCF in \"solidly positive\" territory, is an \"indirect way of acknowledging remaining headwinds.\" Based on a FactSet survey of analysts, FCF is expected to improve to about negative $902.5 million in the third quarter and to positive $1.27 billion in the fourth quarter; it was negative $2.1 billion the second quarter. In the second-quarter post-earnings call with analysts, Chief Executive Larry Culp said FCF would improve sequentially in the second-half of 2020, then turn positive in 2021. \"Unlike peers, GE continues to have no official guidance, which in our view implies difficulty seeing 3-6 months out, while debt maturities and options resets suggest GE does not see normal until '24.\" The stock has tumbled 43.3% year to date, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average  has slipped 0.2%.

Li (ticker: LI) delivered 2,711 ONE sport-utility vehicles in August. There isn’t a year over year comparison because Li started producing the ONE, its only vehicle in production so far, in November 2019. Through the end of the second quarter, Li had delivered about 10,400 vehicles, which amounts to about 1,500 a month. It’s difficult to adjust for the pandemic and seasonal factors, but the 2,711 figure appears pretty good. Li shares are on the move, up about 4% in premarket trading. Since the company’s initial public offering in late July, shares are up about 59%. Of course, the entire EV sector is on fire. Tesla shares, for instance, are up 58% over the same span. Overall, those EV stocksBarron’s tracks that have been trading since the start of 2020 are up more than 350% since then, on average.

Gross margins were up 6.5 percentage points from the first quarter to 23.6%, while inventory was down 29% from last year, leaving Macy’s with a “clean inventory position” at the end of the second quarter. According to data from Placer.ai, Macy’s traffic was down about 44% in July. That may not sound great on its own, but it is a meaningful recovery from the 99% decline it notched in April, when the pandemic lockdowns closed its nonessential stores, and better than Nordstrom’s 65% year-over-year decline. Of course, with nearly 42% of Macy’s shares outstanding shorted, the pop could also have to do with bears covering their positions. Ultimately Macy’s was able to beat low expectations, but the structural problems facing department stores—from increasing competition to changing consumer habits—and the health and economic threat of Covid, will remain a problem for the company and its peers.

ADP’s employment report, released this morning, showed U.S. employers added 428,000 private jobs in August, below economists’ estimates for 1 million jobs added. Wall Street is also awaiting the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book report, which will be released at 2 p.m. EDT. “Solid economic data out of the United States and China are giving investors hope that the global economy might recover faster than expected from the Covid-19 crisis. This is an important signal for markets, which have already priced in a lot of positive news,” Milan Cutkovic, market analyst at AxiCorp, told clients in a note. Europe’s common currency eased after Philip Lane, chief economist at the European Central Bank, reportedly voiced concern over the euro-dollar rate. “If there are forces moving the euro-dollar rate around, that feeds into our global and European forecasts and that in turn does feed into our monetary policy setting,” Lane said in an online conference on Tuesday evening. The comments weren’t too surprising and the ECB will probably stick to verbal intervention instead of cutting rates, Gizem Kara, economist at BNP Paribas in London, told clients in a note. The economist said “risk-reward of cutting is not favorable right now” and if the market perceives the ECB has used up its firepower, the currency could even rise. The latest survey from Nationwide Building Society showed U.K. house prices rose by a seasonally adjusted 2% in August, the highest monthly rise since February 2004.

    "text": "At the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, close to eight of 10 MBA students say they are not excited about the coming fall semester because the coronavirus pandemic has forced classes online. At UCLA’s Anderson School of Management, newly admitted international students are outraged that they cannot defer their admission to the school’s MBA program even if they cannot get a student visa to come to the U.S. At New York University’s Stern School of Business, students are demanding the reversal of a 3.5% increase in MBA tuition during COVID-19 and asking for a 5% to 10% discount on the price of their degrees because of the shift to virtual classes. Add to all of the anxiety and frustration the fact that some graduates from the most prestigious business schools, including Harvard and Stanford universities, saw their summer internships and full-time job offers clawed back by companies due to the COVID recession. Many more are deeply worried about their prospects for landing a job over the next year as still more companies freeze budgets and hiring plans. So is this a time to apply to an MBA program and go even further into debt? You better believe it is, and here’s why. A recession and a health crisis, no matter how severe, will not last forever. But while it lasts, many will find their opportunities to advance at work diminished or completely curtailed. Many more have already found themselves on unemployment. By the time this year’s incoming MBA students graduate in 2023, it is almost a certainty that both COVID-19 and the economic downturn will be in the rearview mirror. The Class of 2023 will inevitably graduate into a fully recovered economy, better prepared to take full advantage of the upturn. No less crucial, they will have been the beneficiaries of not merely the business basics or of the leadership development a strong MBA program provides; they will be steeped in both data analytics, specifically how to smartly harness massive datasets for decision making, and how to leverage new technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, to gain important efficiencies in a business moving forward. Of all the graduate degrees you could earn, an MBA from a highly selective business school is pretty much a no-brainer investment. The top five schools for average starting pay last year — base salary plus signing bonus — are all big names, led by the Wharton School at $172,016, NYU Stern ($168,291), Stanford ($168,226), Dartmouth College’s Tuck School of Business ($166,251), and the University of Virginia’s Darden School of Business ($165,292). In all, 12 schools in the top 25 of U.S. News’s MBA ranking report starting salaries above $160,000, and 17 above $150,000. “If you stayed at work in 2021, your career options and earning potential in 2023 would be more limited if you had gone to business school,” noted Soojin Kwon, managing director of full-time MBA admissions and program at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business. Why? Kwon notes that students will gain three advantages by going back to school that they won’t get by staying in a job during the pandemic. “One, you’ll meet with and learn from hundreds of smart, ambitious and interesting people you wouldn’t have met if you didn’t go to business school,” Kwon said at a recent panel discussion for Poets & Quants.  “Two, you’re going to learn how to network and interview for jobs in an industry or function that you’re interested in going into, and most, if not all MBA recruiters this year are planning to do virtual recruiting. So you’re going to learn how to interview in the format in which recruiters are going to be recruiting. In addition, she said, “You’re going to gain access to a network of tens of thousands of business school alumni and hundreds of thousands of alumni in the broader university community. You could absolutely find another job through LinkedIn, but it’s no secret that you’re more likely to get a response if you have some kind of connection, and an MBA from a top school with the support of alumni provides that invaluable connection for life.” During the Great Recession of 2008-2009, the job situation was just as miserable and prospects for many MBAs appeared so dim that some openly questioned their decision to borrow money to get the degree. Robert Bruner, then dean of the University of Virginia’s Darden School of Business, found himself having to defend the value of the MBA. He rose to the challenge, and his points then made much sense now. Education adds significant value to human potential. “Generally, research finds real rates of return on investment upwards of 10% and as high as 50%. And there is a correlation between years in school and earning power but that’s only the quantitative part. Every year, students graduate who are more self-confident, better communicators, and more promising leaders than when they enrolled. And they have joined an alumni network that has helped in good times and bad.” Indeed, long-term thinking beats short-term thinking all the time. Young professionals have a long career ahead of them. “With the benefits of modern medicine, you can probably look forward to a career of 50 years,” Bruner wrote. “Are you judging the worth of an MBA by only the first job you get out of B-school? Take the long view. If you could discount the marginal benefits of an MBA from a competitive school over the next 50 years, I’d guess that they well exceed the costs. Don’t discount the future too steeply.” Truth is, you can bet with certainty that tough times will again appear once this pandemic is under control and the economy recovers. The ability to assess and bear sensible risks is the core of business and entrepreneurship. Pursuing a graduate degree in business to learn valuable skills, cultivate one’s leadership potential, and acquire a supportive network of connected professionals is a risk worth taking. John A. Byrne is the founder of C-Change Media, a global digital media company of higher education content including Poets&Quants.com, a website for applicants to business schools. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is using its authority to implement a temporary eviction moratorium through the end of the year, the Trump administration said Tuesday evening. Unlike the federal moratorium included in the CARES Act that expired in late July, the CDC's moratorium will apply to all rental units nationwide, senior administration officials said. Renters will be eligible for the moratorium's protection if they received a stimulus check, and they must be able to prove that they made an effort to receive government assistance and that they could not afford rent.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/massachusetts-voters-to-decide-bitter-markey-kennedy-primary-fight-2020-09-01?mod=home-page",
    "text": "BOSTON — U.S. Sen. Edward Markey of Massachusetts defeated U.S. Rep. Joe Kennedy III in Tuesday’s hard-fought Democratic primary, harnessing support from progressive leaders to overcome a challenge from a younger rival who is a member of America’s most famous political family. It was the first time a Kennedy has lost a race for Congress in Massachusetts. Markey appealed to voters in the deeply Democratic state by positioning himself as aligned with the liberal wing of the party. He teamed up with a leading progressive, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, on the Green New Deal climate change initiative — and at one point labeled Kennedy “a progressive in name only.” That helped Markey overcome the enduring power of the Kennedy name in Massachusetts. The 39-year-old congressman sought to cast the 74-year-old Markey as someone out of touch after spending decades in Congress, first in the House before moving to the Senate. Kennedy said Tuesday night that the results aren’t the ones he’d hoped for, but pledged to work for Markey’s reelection. “The senator is a good man. You never heard me say otherwise,” Kennedy told supporters at an outdoor rally. Kennedy also suggested that the movement of supporters the campaign pulled together would continue past the current election. “We may have lost the final vote count tonight but we built a coalition that will endure,” he said. “I would this again with all of you in a heartbeat.” In the waning weeks of the campaign, Kennedy leaned into his family’s long political legacy in Massachusetts. His pedigree includes former President John F. Kennedy; former U.S. Senator and U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, his grandfather; and former U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy, who held a Senate seat in Massachusetts for nearly half a century until his death in 2009. Markey countered by leaning into his own family story — growing up in the working class city of Malden with a father who drove a truck for the Hood Milk company. In one campaign video, Markey also paraphrased a famous JFK quote, saying, “We asked what we could do for our country. We went out, we did it. With all due respect, it’s time to start asking what your country can do for you.” Markey also found himself on the defense at times during the campaign, with Kennedy repeatedly trying to portray him as having a tin ear to racial equity concerns. Kennedy faulted Markey for his initial opposition to the effort to desegregate the Boston Public Schools beginning in the 1970s. Markey countered by noting that he changed his views on the contentious issue that tore at the fabric of the city. He also said he supported the creation in 1973 of a state Senate seat aimed at helping elect a Black senator to the Massachusetts Legislature. Kennedy also repeatedly pointed to the father of Danroy “DJ” Henry, a young Black man from Massachusetts killed by police 10 years ago. Henry’s father has criticized Markey, saying he failed to help the family seek justice. Markey said he has apologized to the Henry family and signed a letter seeking a federal Justice Department investigation into the killing. Markey also wasn’t shy about talking about the Kennedy family, at one point pressing Kennedy to tell his father — former U.S. Rep. Joe Kennedy ll — to stop supporting a political action committee that was running ads against Markey. “I’m sure your father is watching right now,” Markey said. “Tell your father right now that you don’t want money to go into a super PAC that runs negative ads.” Kennedy said he had “no idea” if his father was helping fund the PAC. Late in the race, Kennedy also landed a major endorsement when Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi formally backed his candidacy. While Markey, who served with Pelosi in the House for decades, congratulated Kennedy, Pelosi’s decision angered some of Markey’s younger progressive supporters. Markey had earlier won the endorsement of Ocasio-Cortez and fellow Massachusetts Democratic U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren. “Ed Markey wasn’t afraid. He offered his expertise & partnership. He wasn’t scared of big policy & didn’t use kid gloves. It’s great to watch him overcome the odds and win tonight,” Ocasio-Cortez tweeted Tuesday night. The coronavirus upended the way both candidates could reach out to voters — severely limiting more traditional means of electioneering like knocking on doors, shaking hands or holding big rallies. Instead, the campaigns were largely waged online with virtual rallies, virtual endorsements, virtual fundraisers and virtual roundtable events to discuss issues. Eventually, as Massachusetts began to suppress the virus and emerge from a near lockdown, the candidates began to take their campaigns on the road — with appropriate social distancing rules and face masks in tow. The showdown drew criticism from some Democrats nationally who feared it would siphon time and money away from the primary goals of defeating President Donald Trump and winning back control of the Senate, It also wasn’t cheap, with both Kennedy and Markey raising millions to pay for campaign staff, television and digital ads and old-school campaign flyers. Markey now faces a general election contest where he is considered a strong favorite in a district that has historically elected Democrats. He’ll face the winner of the Republican primary, Kevin O’Connor, in November.

    "text": "U.S. stock-index futures were holding on to firm gains on Wednesday as investors drew hope from improvement on rapid testing for COVID-19, the possibility of a vaccine against the deadly disease, and potential progress in Washington another coronavirus fiscal stimulus package. Investors were digesting a private-sector jobs report that came in weaker than expected, well below the nearly 1 million that had been estimated for the month. An  account of business conditions in parts of the U.S. from the Federal Reserve is due later in the afternoon. Stock markets looked upbeat early Wednesday, with a number of possible catalysts helping the investing mood amid the coronavirus pandemic. Bloomberg reported that U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has again restarted talks with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, sparking fresh hope of another fiscal stimulus plan to help out-of-work Americans. On the health front, the leading health expert Dr. Anthony Fauci said that a COVID-19 pandemic could come sooner than expected if the roster of companies attempting to achieve a cure are able to produce outstanding preliminary results. Speaking to Kaiser Health News, Fauci said that the board that is overseeing vaccine approvals could decided that “the data is so good right now that you can say it’s safe and effective.” The global tally for confirmed cases of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 climbed to 25.8 million on Wednesday, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University, while the death toll rose to 857,552 Early moves in the session come a day after buying in large-capitalization technology stocks and shares tied to pandemic stay-at-home trends led the S&P 500 index to record its 21st record close of 2020 and the Nasdaq Composite its 41st on Tuesday. ADP did, however, raise last month’s jobs figure  to 212,000 for July from  a  rise of 167,000, which was then below forecast of 1.9 million jobs. The economy has recouped fewer than half of the 20 million-plus jobs lost in the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic. In other news, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention late Tuesday implemented a temporary eviction moratorium through the end of the year, protecting millions of U.S. renters from losing their homes during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Trump administration announced. Other economic data, will be watched, including the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book, an anecdotal account of business conditions in the central bank’s districts set to be released at 2 p.m. ET, and before that a report on factory orders for July is due. Reports on U.S. automobile sales will rollout throughout the day. On the heels of a huge month for stocks in August, our call of the day says investors need to get ready for at least two pullbacks this year, with history as a guide.

    "text": "European stocks rallied on Wednesday, boosted as the euro pulled back from a two-year high and on bullish optimism for equities on Wall Street. A pullback for the euro was attributed to comments by Philip Lane, chief economist at the European Central Bank, who said “the euro-dollar rate does matter.” “If there are forces moving the euro-dollar rate around, that feeds into our global and European forecasts and that in turn does feed into our monetary policy setting,” Lane reportedly said in an online conference on Tuesday evening, according to Bloomberg. “These comments constitute the first pushback against appreciation in this EURUSD cycle and does not come as a surprise. However, our central case remains that the ECB will stick to verbal intervention, rather than cut the deposit facility rate,” said Gizem Kara, economist at BNP Paribas in London, in a note to clients. The economist said “risk-reward of cutting is not favorable right now” and if the market perceives the ECB has used up its firepower, the currency could even rise. Data released on Tuesday showed eurozone consumer prices dropping in August for the first time in four years. Luxury goods makers and apparel companies joined the rally, with LVMH Moet Hennessey Louis Vuitton up 3.4%, Kering climbing nearly 5%, and Adidas up 4%. But Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, said the company had “been performing strongly prior to the pandemic, and there are some signs that a recovery is already in place following the full opening of its sites at the end of June.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/oil-prices-lifted-by-lackluster-bounce-in-opec-crude-output-inventory-fall-2020-09-02?mod=home-page",
    "text": "Oil futures traded higher Wednesday, finding support on signs of a slower-than-expected rebound in crude output by the OPEC+ alliance and a steeper-than-expected fall in U.S. inventories. “With one more week of U.S. driving season left, oil prices received a much needed helping hand from a bullish to consensus oil inventory draw,” said Stephen Innes, chief global markets strategist at AxiCorp, in a note. The American Petroleum Institute reported late Tuesday that U.S. crude supplies fell by 6.4 million barrels in the week ended Aug. 28, according to sources. The API data also showed gasoline stockpiles down 5.8 million barrels, while distillate inventories were down by 1.4 million barrels, they said. Crude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, storage hub, meanwhile, declined by 237,000 barrels for the week, sources said. The Energy Information Administration’s more closely watched storage data is due Wednesday morning. It’s expected to show crude inventories fell by 1.2 million barrels last week, according to analysts polled by S&P Global Platts. They also forecast supply declines of 4.7 million barrels for gasoline and 900,000 barrels in distillates. Some analysts played down the importance of the U.S. inventory data over the next few weeks, citing disruptions created by Hurricane Laura, which left nearly a third of oil production in the Gulf of Mexico still shut down as of Tuesday. “The U.S. inventory reports in the next few weeks…are unlikely to be particularly meaningful because the hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico have massively hampered the production and transport of crude oil and oil products,” said Eugen Weinberg, analyst at Commerzbank, in a note. Meanwhile, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries was slow in bringing back production last month as it relaxed output curbs, according to a Bloomberg survey cited by analysts. It found that members increased output by only half the amount allowed after OPEC and its allies, an alliance known as OPEC+, agreed to taper collective outputs to 7.7 million barrels a day beginning in August from 9.7 million barrels a day. Reuters on Tuesday reported that oil production by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries rose by 950,000 barrels per day to 24.27 million barrels per day in August, from July, following a three-decade output low in June. The move followed a decision by OPEC and its allies to taper collective output cuts to 7.7 million barrels per day starting May 1 from record cuts of 9.7 million barrels a day. Major U.S. stock indexes closed higher Tuesday, near or above prior all-time records, as upbeat economic reports and dovish tones from the Fed helped feed the buying momentum on Wall Street.

    "text": "Investors are betting people will go back to the movies. Wednesday’s premarket gains cut year-to-date losses in the stock to about 10%. Not bad for a company that posted a first-half 2020 loss of more than $25 a share and which was forced to suspend its 20-cent quarterly dividend. What’s more, shares are up about 230% from their 52-week low. The market expects things to keep improving. Hollywood, for one, is trying to help entice moviegoers back into theaters. AMC’s reopening plan coincides with Christopher Nolan’s thriller Tenet hitting U.S. screens. The film earned $53 million in the overseas box office last weekend, a meager sum for such a highly touted film in a pre-Covid world, but amid coronavirus lockdowns, the number looks great. Two top White House officials said Tuesday that a deal on a fresh round of coronavirus relief spending could still be reached, despite talks with Democrats stalling for more than a month. What’s Next: A smaller proposal is unlikely to break the deadlock. A so-called skinny bill has been repeatedly shot down by Democrats, who have insisted on a package commensurate with what they see as the size of the current crisis. The Senate is back in session next Tuesday. The largest school district in the U.S. delayed the start of in-person teaching after Mayor Bill de Blasio and the teachers union reached an agreement and averted the threat of a strike over classroom safety concerns amid the coronavirus pandemic. What’s Next: Teachers will return to school buildings on Sept. 8. The first day of in-person classes was moved to Sept. 21 from Sept. 10. Remote learning is delayed to Sept. 16 from Sept. 10. President Donald Trump traveled to Kenosha, Wis., on Tuesday to visit businesses that were damaged in the city during nights of unrest following the shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man, by police on Aug. 23. Protests and unrest have become a central theme of his re-election campaign. What’s Next: Joe Biden, who challenged Trump Monday to join him in condemning violence, is expected to break August fundraising records. The Biden campaign raised $70 million during its convention and a total of $300 million this month. The Trump campaign hasn’t reported its total, but raised $76 million during its convention. What’s Next: The inquiry could prove embarrassing for the two ruling coalition parties, Merkel’s conservative CDU and Scholz’s social-democratic SPD, one year before the general election to take place in the fall of 2021. But Merkel is retiring then, whereas Scholz will be running as his party’s candidate for the chancellor job. What’s Next: McDonald’s has pledged to increase diversity in the wake of George Floyd’s killing in police custody and had been in talks to settle with the Black franchisees since June, but those negotiations broke down, a lawyer for the franchisees said. I have been married to my husband for 38 years and we have three children together. When his mother passed away he received an inheritance of $8,000. I was never told about this money, and he spent all of it before I found out he even received his inheritance. When my father passed away, it was my father’s intent that any inheritance we received would be kept in my father’s family, so naturally my inheritance was made out to me and me alone. I deposited the money into a checking account with just my name on it. Within 30 days of receiving my inheritance, I purchased a home with the proceeds, and I was talked into putting my husband’s name on the deed. The check given to the seller’s attorney was a cashier’s check with my name alone. If I die before my husband is it possible to put the house into a living trust given that my father’s intent was to keep the money within the family, and not my married husband’s family? I want this home to be an inheritance for our children, and I don’t want him to sell it as soon as I die. I wish to make sure that he doesn’t sell it or rent it out in his lifetime. I would like him to live there until he dies. He has paid for a couple of renovations to the home. How would I go about making sure that my kids will have this home as an inheritance assuming I predecease my husband? —A.G. Read The Moneyist’s response.

    "text": "Shares of DraftKings rallied Wednesday after the company added basketball legend Michael Jordan as an adviser to the company. Jordan will provide strategic and creative input to the board of directors on company strategy, product development, diversity, equity and belonging, marketing activities and other key initiatives, the company said. DraftKings shares have surged since becoming public, and have gained 245% this year. Jordan is known for being an avid gambler, a topic he discussed in the documentary, The Last Dance. Forbes put Jordan’s net worth at $2.1 billion in May, calling him the world’s richest former athlete, who uniquely still has endorsement deals with companies including Nike while being majority owner of Hornets. DraftKings didn’t disclose Jordan’s equity stake. According to FactSet, its top shareholder is Shalom Meckenzie, whose SBTech merged with DraftKings as part of the deal turning the company public, and ESPN owner Walt Disney DIS has a 6% stake. A bearish analyst on Tesla Inc.  is now a little less bearish, saying the electric vehicle maker has become one of the most important stocks in the U.S. stock market, but said the stock remains fundamentally overvalued. The stock surged 6.8% in premarket trading Tuesday, after soaring 12.6% on Monday. RBC Capital's Joseph Spak lifted is price target to $290, which implies a 42% drop from Monday's record close of $498.32, from $170, while maintaining the underperform rating he's had on the stock since January 2019. \"We recognize we underestimated a critical valuation point: seemingly insatiable investor demand for alternative/clean vehicles,\" Spak wrote in a note to clients. He said he also believes investors have willing to show more patience and look further out for companies like Tesla. \"That being said, we struggle to explain the run-up to the stock split which academically doesn't change the value of Tesla equity but could help fuel investor interest,\" Spak wrote. \"We still view Tesla as fundamentally overvalued and having to grow into its valuation.\" Of the 36 analysts surveyed by FactSet, just 19% are bullish, 31% are bearish, and 50% are neutral.

    "text": "Don’t lock them out: lock them in until you have a deal. Shutting out private equity bidders was a favored tactic during the heady days of the debt-fueled buyout boom in 2003. So it’s a strange one to resort to when times are tough and private capital should be welcome. The troubled provider of insurance and cruises to the over-50s rejected a recent 33 pence-a-share takeover offer from a consortium of two unnamed U.S. private equity groups, which it said was“unsolicited and highly conditional.” Instead, Saga has chosen to tap its shareholders – which includes dozens of retail investors – for £150 million ($201 million) in an equity raise to cope with its spiralling debts. As part of the plan, Sir Roger De Haan, the son of Saga’s founder Sidney, will return to the company’s board as chairman, replacing incumbent Patrick O’Sullivan. Saga prides itself on looking after its loyal customer base. However, many of those loyal customers are retail shareholders who ironically, as a result of Saga’s proposal, will be diluted by more than 40% compared with the 140% premium they would have been received from the spurned private equity bidders’ offer. Saga’s convoluted proposal has De Haan, who sold Saga for £1.35 billion in 2004,  investing £75.5 million to buy 324 million shares, or an average entry price of 23 pence a share, to give him a 17% stake. In addition, by underwriting a third of the £75 million placing he could invest a further £25 million at 15 pence, lowering his average entry price to 20 pence and increasing his stake to 25%. That could be enough to block any future bids for the company, which may be in need of further investment in the future. The cruise industry – among those hit hardest by the pandemic – doesn’t look like it will recover anytime soon. Private equity has abundant supplies of dry powder to inject into troubled companies. The same can’t be said for shareholders who will be expected to stump up more cash in coming months as many companies look to raise equity to cope with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on their operations, which has left many of them reliant on borrowing to meet expenses. On Tuesday, AA granted its potential bidders –  which include a joint offer from Centerbridge Partners Europe and TowerBrook Capital, as well as separate cash bids from Platinum Equity Advisors and Warburg Pincus International –  an extra four weeks to make an offer for the company. Now is the right time for Saga to learn from its ex-sibling. These tech companies have yet to report financial results for the quarter but have demonstrated they are benefiting from the pandemic.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/surge-in-megadeals-points-to-ma-recovery-as-tech-sector-dominates-2020-09-01?mod=home-page",
    "text": "A series of blockbuster deals drove corporate deal making to its strongest start of all time in the second half, as chief executives hit the acquisition trail again after sitting on the sidelines during the height of the pandemic. The combined value of megadeals announced so far during the second half of 2020 reached $256 billion, according to data from Refinitiv. That tally was only exceeded once in this period, in 2015. Nine deals worth $5 billion or more were announced in August alone — the biggest count for that month since 1999, dominated by the technology and health-care sectors. “A coalescence of deals on hold coming back to life, central banks providing copious amounts of cheap liquidity and companies seeking growth has led to an M&A [mergers and acquisitions] boom as deal makers have returned from pandemic enforced seclusion,” said Frank Aquila, global head of M&A at international law firm Sullivan & Cromwell. “Unless there is a significant economic shutdown in the coming months, M&A activity will likely remain at near record levels through at least the end of 2020 and likely well into 2021,” he added. Deals in the tech sector total $69.3 billion, accounting for 27% of global M&A activity during August. Six of the largest 10 deals announced globally during the month involved tech sector targets, while health-care deals total $38.5 billion, the highest monthly number since December 2019. The resurgence in deal making comes after the coronavirus halted a six-year M&A boom, as companies moved to preserve cash instead of pursuing big-ticket acquisitions. In April, dozens of companies worldwide drew down lines of credit, looking to bolster their cash piles as revenues collapsed amid the near-shut down of the economy. Activist investors also took a back seat at the height of the pandemic, as the tools that once boosted returns at target companies became impossible to use amid sinking valuations and the continuing massive government intervention in the world’s largest economies. Share prices have since recovered, spurring companies with strong balance sheets to target their more vulnerable rivals, but overall, activity is still down. During the first eight months of 2020, the value of global deal making reached $1.8 trillion, a 31% fall from the same period last year and the lowest year-to-date level since 2013, Refinitiv data shows. Asia-Pacific accounted for the highest share of year-to-date activity. On Aug. 31, French water and waste management group Veolia said that it had made an all-cash offer to acquire a 29.9% stake in its peer Suez from Engie, at a price of €15.50 ($18.46) a share. Suez issued a statement shortly after, saying Veolia’s approach “has been unsolicited and Suez had no discussion with Veolia about a possible merger.” It added that it has set up an ad hoc committee to examine the proposal. Last year, shareholder activist firm Amber Capital called for a strategy review at Suez, arguing that the French utility had underperformed rivals and could create more value for its shareholders. The major market indexes keep going up, but the notion that the stock market might be too frothy for its own good continues to be downplayed.

    "text": "With the U.S. economy grappling with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, investment advisers are seeing the ripple effects. Some clients fear losing everything they’ve built. For some, the threat of bankruptcy is a reality, while for others, even the remote possibility of going broke stirs feelings of dread. Advisers face a tricky challenge in aiding these anxious clients. On one hand, they have a responsibility to prepare individuals for the worst — and devise a plan if the money runs out. But in their effort to assist clients in desperate financial straits, they risk coming on too strong. Facing the likelihood of losing it all can prove immobilizing. Rushing to draft a detailed strategy and offer technical advice will backfire if a client isn’t ready to listen. First, an adviser needs to show concern and gather information. “Maybe the client is treading water with their anxiety,” said Meghaan Lurtz, a senior research associate at Kitces.com, which provides education and resources for financial planners. “Part of an adviser’s job is to be there while they tread” and serve as a sounding board. Advisers who set a supportive tone are better positioned to help clients grapple with their fear. Responding to anxiety with non-judgmental acceptance is a good first step. “It may be exhausting and stressful for advisers to deal with these clients,” Lurtz said. “But you still need to thank them for opening up to you. That makes them feel safe.” The next step is to try to learn more. To someone scared of losing their business, for example, say: “Tell me how things for you are going.” “Get to the heart of what the client is experiencing and what’s at the heart of their fear,” Lurtz said. “It may be they’re nervous about losing key employees to the virus or how long they can continue to pay them. Or it may be a decline in revenues and their P&L [profit and loss]. It may be about something else.” She urges advisers to make statements (“Tell me more about that”) rather than pose questions. That’s because clients are more apt to lower their guard and speak freely when responding to a neutrally worded prompt. “When we hear a question, our brain thinks there’s a right and wrong answer,” she said. “But people respond very differently to a statement. It cues the client that you really want to know, and solicits a richer type of response.” Advisers tend to draw conclusions from data analysis. If they think a client’s fear of losing it all is unfounded, they may trot out facts and figures as reassurance. Yet appealing to rationality when someone is not thinking clearly — and riddled with fear — carries risk. “Whether the fear is rational or irrational, it’s real in the client’s mind,” said Kim Bourne, a New York City-based certified financial planner. “So you have to get to the root cause, whatever is underlying that fear.” She cites the example of a client, a pre-retiree in his 60s, who feared a financial wipeout as the market tanked in mid-March. In reality, he held significant assets and faced no danger of bankruptcy. “He had the experience of poverty in his past, so he was afraid,” she said. “The fear of losing everything was lingering in his head.” Bourne dignified his fear. Instead of trying to appeal to his rational side by crunching the numbers, she sought to learn more about his feelings. “Tell me more about what it felt like when you didn’t have enough money,” she said. Then she asked, “What did you learn from those dark moments?” Then she asked: “How did that help you achieve your greatest financial accomplishments?” He came away with a restored sense of perspective, Bourne says, and his fear no longer plagues him as much. A stock split is a financial ‘non-event,’ but it can still play on investors’ emotions, experts say. Morey Stettner is a writer in Portsmouth, N.H.

    "text": "If you are an investor of any type — whether you have a 401(k), IRA, or trading account — there are a few things you could do to promote racial equity. You may have heard of ESG investing, which stands for “environmental, social and governance.” It is also often called sustainable, socially responsible or simply “values” investing. It’s an investment strategy that selects stocks and bonds based not only on traditional financial criteria, but also based on the impact of different companies on society and the environment. Proponents of ESG investing point to a growing body of evidence that suggests sustainable investing may actually improve a portfolio’s performance, while also serving the greater good. Over the past five years, sustainable funds have outperformed their conventional peers in both up and down markets, according to a Morningstar report. Also, as markets tumbled during the first quarter of 2020, almost 60% of the biggest U.S. sustainable mutual funds and exchange-traded funds lost less in market value than the S&P 500. The popularity of socially responsible investing has exploded in recent years. In early 2020, around 74% of global investors said they plan to increase their ESG allocation over the next year. In the first quarter of 2020, U.S., sustainable funds saw inflows of $10.5 billion, according to Morningstar — a more than 10-fold increase from the first quarter of 2010. And even as markets tumbled due to the coronavirus crisis, global demand for ESG proved resilient. The global sustainable-fund universe saw inflows of over $45 billion in the first quarter, while the overall fund universe saw outflows of more than $380 billion, according to Morningstar. Environmental factors often include things like carbon emissions and water usage. Social impact may involve working conditions for a company’s employees and gender or racial equity. And governance criteria often have to do with board oversight and transparency. In light of recent events, the “S” — or social — part of ESG has come into focus, as more and more people are looking at the social impact of large corporations, specifically from a racial justice standpoint. That’s where things get a little tricky. There are more than 300 funds marketed as ESG in the U.S., according to Morningstar. But there’s no official definition of “socially responsible” investing. To further complicate the issue, there are dozens of different companies that issue ESG ratings, ranging from large data providers, like MSCI and Sustainalytics, to smaller companies and even nonprofits that focus on topics like gender-pay equity and civil liberties. Unlike accounting standards, there is not one unique methodology. Some of the data is self-reported by the companies, and some of it is done by third parties, who are often estimating. There are of course some broad principles, like how the company treats its workers — but these are often hard to quantify. For example, companies can get a high score for having anti-harassment policies in place, without tracking how well the policies are actually implemented. “There are not yet clear apple-to-apple comparisons across the board even for public companies, let alone private companies,” said Andrei Cherny, CEO of Aspiration, an online “financial firm with a conscience,” which offers a variety of banking and investing products focused on environmental and social impact. Cherny has called for regulators to require public companies to report ESG-related data, such as carbon emissions, diversity of their workforce, and how they pay their employees — just like they have legal obligations to report their financial performance. “Those are factors that investors need to know just as much as they need to know the price-to-earnings ratio,” he said. Other industry leaders echo Cherny’s thoughts. For instance, in the wake of recent events, Calvert Research & Management, a prominent sustainable-investing shop, called for companies to “accurately assess their racial diversity” and make it public, provide pay equity disclosure across race and gender, and publicly state what they are doing to combat racism and police brutality. Meanwhile, some asset managers have decided to influence change from the inside. Neuberger Berman, which manages $330 billion, decided to use its shareholder status to drive governance and sustainability practices. In April 2020, the company announced that it would publicly disclose and explain the firm’s voting rationale and intentions at more than 25 key annual shareholder meetings. “Normally shareholders vote quietly behind the scenes,” said Jonathan Bailey, Head of ESG at Neuberger Berman. Instead, by providing advance vote disclosure, Neuberger Berman intends to educate investors and the public on “why we’re voting a particular way,” Bailey said. “We have a responsibility, as market participants, to take [these issues] seriously; they’re financially material issues,” Bailey said. The proposal did not end up passing, as it gathered about 30% shareholder support, according to a Neuberger Berman spokesperson. While there are currently no industry-wide standards around social impact, a few companies have launched niche products specifically targeted at race and equality. For example, OpenInvest, a company that builds indexes and other investing tools around social causes, has created an index specifically on racial justice. It screens for metrics like board member inclusion, workforce diversity and which companies pollute the most in communities of color. Similarly, Impact Shares, a nonprofit provider of exchange-traded funds, partnered with the NAACP to launch a first-of-its-kind racial empowerment ETF. But what the ESG industry has been missing is that “your social priorities may be drastically different from my social priorities,” said Ethan Powell, CEO of Impact Shares. For example, some ESG funds hold shares of liquor or gaming companies. These holdings might be a problem for some investors, but not others. Powell envisions a future where “effectively every social issue will be reflected with a separately investible fund,” so that investors can create portfolios that are reflective of their individual social priorities. Partnering with nonprofits could play a key role in the development of such products, according to Powell, because social-advocacy organizations are in a better position to understand the particular social issues at hand. What many experts agree on is that growing investor demand will inevitably push the industry to innovate. Years ago socially-responsible investing offered just a few options to cover a small piece of investors’ stock portfolios. Today, there are hundreds of different mutual and exchange-traded funds to pick from, not just in equities but also in fixed income and even junk bonds. One study showed that around $12 trillion of assets in the U.S. are managed under some sustainable investing strategy. So while you wait for the industry to establish widely-accepted standards, you could start building your own socially-responsible portfolio by looking at the ratings and methodology of different funds and companies and picking what aligns best with your values and financial goals. With much of the market recovering from its March lows, it is no wonder that investors are looking for opportunities in beaten-up sectors. And bank stocks certainly fit the bill.

    "text": "Sophisticated algorithms are being used by one of Europe’s biggest movie theater chains to help with social distancing. Vue International, which has around 230 cinemas in the U.K., Germany, Taiwan, Italy, Poland and other European countries, has been using artificial intelligence to optimize screening times and is making adjustments to control the flow of audiences into auditoriums. Tim Richards, who founded privately owned Vue cinemas around 20 years ago, said 10 years’ worth of data had been fed in computers pre-COVID to decide on the timing and frequency for screening movies. This has now been adapted to control the flow of customers into the cinemas by staggering screening times. It is being linked with seating software that cocoons customers within their family bubbles, or on their own, a safe distance away from other customers. Richards, speaking at a press briefing on Monday evening, said: “It took me 17 years to build the group up to 230 cinemas. What happened just a few months ago was apocalyptic. “We have planned for crises such as a cinema being shut and blockbusters tanking, but not all the cinemas being down. Our big [cost] exposures are studios, people, and rent — we were quickly focused on our burn rate and liquidity.” Last month it was reported that Vue was lining up £100 million ($133 million) in additional debt financing. The firm is owned by Alberta Investment Management Corporation and pension fund Omers. Richards and other managers hold a 27% stake. Vue has been slowly reopening its cinemas around Europe over the past few weeks. “We have been using AI to help determine what is played, at what screen, and at which cinemas [to optimize revenues],” he said. “Our operating systems have been tweaked to social distance customers. It recognizes if you are with family and it will cocoon you. At the moment we are probably able to use 50% of cinemas’ capacities. “We can control the number of people in the foyer at any one time. Crowds would not be conducive to helping customers feel comfortable coming back. Every member of staff went through two days of safety training.” Richards said when he did reopen his movie theaters there was pent-up demand from customers but no new movies to screen. “We still managed at 50% run rate with classic movies that were not only already available on streaming services but on terrestrial television as well. People just wanted to get out of their homes and have some kind of normalcy.” Christopher Nolan’s complex thriller “Tenet” is the first major new film to be released and Richards said: “We are seeing ‘Tenet’ performing at the same levels as ‘Inception’ and ‘Interstellar’ did which has been amazing. “It will be a bumpy road in some areas but we expect a return to normalcy in six months — it will take a couple of months to get people comfortable again with their positions.” “Netflix has been disruptive for everything in the home,” he said. “We are out of the home, so Netflix is complementary to us because most people who like film like film on all formats. “I’ve seen the demise of the industry predicted definitely five or six times. We have been counter cyclical during downturns — we are reasonably priced so people come out and enjoy what we have to offer.” Do masks really work?

    "text": "The numbers: Private-sector companies added or regained 428,000 jobs in August, ADP said Wednesday, but the modest gain won’t dispel worries about a slowdown in hiring over the summer as the U.S. recovers from the coronavirus. Wall Street economists had forecast an increase of 1 million private-sector jobs, according to Econoday. See ADP report The increase in hiring last month topped a revised 212,000 increase in July, the giant payroll processor said. Initially ADP had reported that just 167,000 new jobs were created in that month. The economy has recouped fewer than half of the 20 million-plus jobs lost in the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic. What happened: Large companies boosted payrolls by 298,000, midsized companies by 79,000 and small companies by 52,000. Hiring rose the fastest in hotels, restaurants, retail, education, health care and professional businesses. The only segment of the economy to lose jobs again was information — media, public relations and the like. Big picture: The ADP report suggests the economic recovery ran into stiffer resistance for the second month in a row, but it’s not always a reliable bellwether. The report, for instance, has shown fewer new jobs created in each of the past four months than the government’s initial estimate. The Labor Department on Friday is likely to report the U.S. created 1.2 million new jobs in August, according to economists polled by MarketWatch. Yet what does seem clear from ADP and other employment barometers is that companies are bringing workers back more slowly compared to earlier in the summer. Or not at all. Some hard-hit industries such as travel and accommodation are even laying off employees again with federal aid drying up and most customers staying away.  That will make it even harder for the economy to return to normal. What they are saying?”The U.S. labor market recovery continued at a fairly sluggish pace in August,” said senior economist Andrew Grantham of CIBC Economics. Do masks really work?

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/cdc-issues-nationwide-eviction-ban-through-the-end-of-the-year-in-an-effort-to-control-coronavirus-2020-09-01?mod=home-page",
    "text": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention implemented a temporary eviction moratorium through the end of the year, protecting U.S. renters from losing their homes during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Trump administration announced Tuesday. The CDC’s moratorium will apply to all rental units nationwide until Dec. 31 and goes into effect immediately, senior administration officials said of an unpublished CDC agency order. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told a U.S. House of Representatives panel Tuesday that the moratorium would cover around 40 million renters. Renters will be eligible for the moratorium’s protection if they received an economic impact payment, or stimulus check, as provided for by the CARES Act. Therefore, single renters must earn no more than $99,000 a year, while couples filing jointly can earn up to $198,000 annually. The order, which was shared ahead of being published in the Federal Register on Sept. 4, includes a declaration for renters to sign and give their landlord. Senior Trump administration officials said the form would be made available on the CDC’s website. Renters must indicate on the declaration that they cannot afford to pay their rent in full and that if evicted they would become homeless or force to move into congregate housing. Renters also must be able to prove that they made an effort to receive government assistance and that they could not afford rent. The moratorium does not absolve renters of paying the rent. That money is still due to landlords, and senior administration officials said that renters should still attempt to make partial payments when they cannot afford to pay in full. Landlords will still be permitted to evict tenants in certain cases, such as instances in which the tenant has destroyed property or poses a threat to the health or safety of neighbors. The moratorium builds on a previous executive order from President Donald Trump that directed the Department of Health and Human Services and the CDC to determine whether halting evictions was necessary to contain the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19. “In the context of a pandemic, eviction moratoria — like quarantine, isolation, and social distancing — can be an effective public health measure utilized to prevent the spread of communicable disease,” the CDC’s unpublished order said. “President Trump is committed to helping hardworking Americans stay in their homes and combating the spread of the coronavirus,” White House deputy press secretary Brian Morgenstern said during a briefing Tuesday. Housing advocates said the move was “long overdue,” but called for more help to be provided to renters facing financial difficulties amid historically high levels of unemployment caused by the pandemic. “As we have said for five months, the very least the federal government ought to do is assure each of us that we won’t lose our homes in the middle of a global pandemic: The administration’s action would do so and will provide relief from the growing threat of eviction for millions of anxious families,” said Diane Yentel, president and CEO of the National Low Income Housing Coalition. “But while an eviction moratorium is an essential step, it is a half-measure that extends a financial cliff for renters to fall off of when the moratorium expires and back rent is owed,” Yentel added, while calling on Congress to pass another COVID-19 relief bill with at least $100 billion in emergency rental assistance. Previously, some lawmakers and activists called for a cancellation of rent during the pandemic. Trump administration officials during Tuesday’s briefing said that renters and landlords would have access to emergency funds already in place, including billions of dollars in grants from the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the $142 billion coronavirus relief fund from the Treasury Department. Administration officials could not clarify whether the CDC moratorium would prevent eviction filings from occurring. Housing and legal advocates have raised concerns that landlords filed evictions against many people nationwide who should have been protected by the CARES Act moratorium. Grocery shoppers are cutting back on spending, data show, a sign that Americans are hurting for cash as the federal unemployment stimulus remains on hold for most recipients.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/as-schools-reopen-amid-covid-19-pandemic-how-long-do-asymptomatic-children-remain-contagious-11599043219?mod=home-page",
    "text": "A new study published in JAMA Pediatrics suggests that children can shed SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, even if they never develop symptoms or even for long after symptoms have cleared. It found a significant variation in how long children continued to shed virus through their respiratory tract and, therefore, could potentially remain infectious. While the virus was detectable for an average of about 2.5 weeks in the entire group, a significant portion of the children —about a fifth of the asymptomatic patients and about half of the symptomatic ones — were still shedding virus at three weeks. The researchers also found that the duration of COVID-19 symptoms also varied widely, from three days to nearly three weeks. A recent systematic review estimated that 16% of children with SARS-CoV-2 infection are asymptomatic, but evidence suggests that as many as 45% of pediatric infections are asymptomatic, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The signs and symptoms of COVID-19 in children are similar to other infections and noninfectious processes, including influenza. While children infected with SARS-CoV-2 are less likely than adults to develop severe illness or complications, they are still at risk of becoming ill. “Recent COVID-19 hospitalization surveillance data shows that the rate of hospitalization among children is low (8 per 100,000 population) compared with that in adults (164.5 per 100,000 population),” the CDC said. Such research comes at an important time for families and communities. Amid pressure from the teachers union to delay the start of the school year, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Tuesday that in-person classes will be pushed back until Sept. 21, 11 days later than planned. Remote learning, also originally slated to start on Sept. 10, will now commence on Sept. 16. Other countries have not fared so well with school reopenings. Israel, which also reopened schools this week, had less success when it reopened schools on May 17 amid high temperatures that made it difficult for students to wear masks, full classrooms that made social distancing near-impossible and, perhaps, the illusion that the virus had been vanquished, creating a false sense of security. The risk, as Israel discovered, is providing an environment where children unwittingly spread the virus to each other, which can lead to community transmission. That’s particularly worrying for those who have underlying conditions and the elderly who are more vulnerable to the most severe effects of the virus. Community transmission also makes contact tracing more difficult. A school outbreak can lead to community, hence staggered school reopenings, social distancing and reduced class sizes. “If we find a certain number of symptomatic people testing positive, we expect the same number of asymptomatic carriers that are much more difficult to identify and isolate,” said Enrico Lavezzo, a professor in the University of Padua’s department of molecular medicine. The latest study in the peer-reviewed JAMA Pediatrics focused on 91 pediatric patients at 22 hospitals in South Korea. “Unlike in the American health system, those who test positive for COVID-19 in South Korea stay at the hospital until they clear their infections even if they aren’t symptomatic,” said Roberta DeBiasi, chief of the Division of Infectious Disease at the Children’s Hospital in Washington, D.C. The patients here were identified for testing through contact tracing or developing symptoms. About 22% never developed symptoms, 20% were initially asymptomatic but developed symptoms later, and 58% were symptomatic at their initial test. The hospital staff tested them every three days on average, providing a picture of how long viral shedding continues over many weeks. Among the important findings from the study: Children, a group widely thought to develop mostly mild disease that quickly passes, can shed virus for weeks, DeBiasi and Meghan Delaney, chief of the Division of Pathology and Lab Medicine at the Children’s National Hospital in Washington, D.C., wrote in a commentary piece to accompany the study in JAMA Pediatrics. Other key points: Even asymptomatic children continued to shed coronavirus after testing positive, making them potential key vectors. In this study at least, there were a large number of asymptomatic patients: About one-fifth of the group in South Korean hospitals. They said the study provides important insight on the role children might play in the spread of COVID-19. But the study also has obvious limitations. One of these relates the link between testing and transmission. A “positive” or “negative” result may not necessarily mean that a child is infectious, “with some positives reflecting bits of genetic material that may not be able to make someone sick,” or, on the other hand, “negatives reflecting low levels of virus that may still be infectious.” They may have tested different parts of the respiratory tract and different testers may yield different results. It’s unclear whether symptomatic children shed different quantities of virus than symptomatic patients. They tested for the active virus – not antibodies – excluding those who may have had and cleared an asymptomatic or mild infection, an important factor for understanding herd immunity. However, DeBiasi said studies such as these can add to the knowledge of public-health efforts being developed and refined to bring COVID-19 under control. “Each of these pieces of information that we, our collaborators and other scientists around the world are working to gather is critical for developing policies that will slow the rate of viral transmission in our community,” she said. As of late Wednesday, COVID-19 has infected 25,773,958 people worldwide, which mostly does not account for asymptomatic cases, and killed 857,552. The U.S. still has the world’s highest number of COVID-19 cases (6,075,652), followed by Brazil (950,931), India (3,769,523) and Russia (1,001,965), according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University. In the meantime, cases keep rising in the U.S. with California becoming the first state in the country to surpass 700,000 confirmed cases; infections there hit 715,617 as of Tuesday with 13,150 COVID-related deaths. New York has recorded 435,510 infections and the highest number of deaths in the U.S. (32,966). COVID has killed 184,689 people in the U.S. AstraZeneca AZN, -1.10% , in combination with Oxford University; BioNTech SE BNTX, -5.61% and partner Pfizer PFE, -2.40% ; GlaxoSmithKline GSK, -1.61% ; Johnson & Johnson JNJ, -1.23% ; Merck & Co. MERK, -0.31% ; Moderna MRNA, -2.41% ; and Sanofi SAN, -1.34% are among those currently working toward COVID-19 vaccines.

    "title": "Moving? What you should know about doing it in a pandemic",
    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-to-move-in-a-pandemic-2020-09-02?mod=home-page",
    "text": "This article is reprinted by permission from NerdWallet. Moving is stressful enough without throwing a pandemic into the mix. Many Americans may be forced to consider moving as some federal foreclosure and eviction moratoriums have expired. In the first week of July, 32% of Americans did not make a full, on-time housing payment, according to a nationally representative survey by the website Apartment List. Others may relocate to save money, be closer to loved ones or simply leave a densely populated area. If you’re considering moving, here’s what to know from a financial standpoint, as well as tips to make moving day safer. Aside from the usual expenses like buying boxes, renting a van or hiring movers, plan for extra costs because of the pandemic. You may need to buy heavy-duty supplies to deep-clean your old place, for example, or to sanitize your new accommodations. If you are moving out of a rental unit, some landlords may ask you to pay for professional cleaners or take the cost out of your security deposit. The Big Move: I work in Silicon Valley, but my job is now remote. I can finally live somewhere cheaper. Where should I go? Moving across county or state lines? Check what the quarantine requirements are in your new location, says Jean Wilczynski, a certified financial planner and senior wealth adviser at Exencial Wealth Advisors in Old Lyme, Connecticut. You may have to pay for quarantine accommodations like a hotel or Airbnb if your new apartment or home is not move-in ready, she says. If you are receiving unemployment benefits, check the rules on how your benefits carry forward in your new location and what the taxes are if it is a new state, Wilczynski says. You can typically find this information on your state’s Department of Labor website, she says. If you are unemployed or your income has dropped as a result of the pandemic, you can also check whether you qualify for moving assistance by calling 211. You might not be able to really get to know your new place until you’re living there, so prepare yourself (and your wallet) for surprises like leaky faucets or broken appliances. Landlords and real-estate agents may offer only virtual tours. And if you can see the new accommodations in person, you may be required to sign a waiver, wear a mask and avoid touching anything while in the house. How to move safely depends on whether you are doing it yourself or using movers. Current guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that the main way the coronavirus spreads is through respiratory droplets, says Lindsay Slowiczek, pharmacist and drug content integrity manager at Healthline.com. That’s why wearing a mask and staying away from people is important to slow the spread of the virus, she says. Sanitizing surfaces is also an extra precaution worth taking. If you’re renting a moving truck, companies like U-Haul offer contactless pickup and drop-off options. Slowiczek suggests sanitizing the door handles, steering wheel, radio and the metal tongue on the seat belt in the rental van. Before picking a moving company, check its website or call and ask about its safety practices in response to the pandemic, Slowiczek says. Ask whether the movers wear masks and gloves during the move. On moving day, she suggests being prepared with a plan to limit interaction with movers and maintain social distancing. This includes packing as many things as you can yourself, or consider using a self-pack moving container as Slowiczek did for her own recent move. The Big Move: I’m tired of renting in Manhattan, but love living in New York. Is now the time to buy if the city is supposedly dead? If the movers will pack the truck, create a schedule for the movers. For example, ask them to start with a particular room as you stay in another. This is also particularly useful if you live with family members who are vulnerable or immunocompromised, she says. Try to limit their involvement with the move as much as possible. “Plan out the way [the movers] are going to move through the house,” says Slowiczek. “If possible, move all of [your boxes] to one area in your home so they don’t have to come throughout your house as much.” Keep hand sanitizer or soap handy during the move so that you and the movers can use it periodically, she says. (Check on the FDA website that your brand of hand sanitizer is methanol-free, Slowiczek adds). After the move, use disinfectants registered with the Environmental Protection Agency to clean surfaces or furniture. “Just using the product as-is is not enough — read the instructions on how long it should be wet on the surface,” Slowiczek says.

    "title": "Why you might not know that Trump is threatening your Social Security",
    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-you-might-not-know-that-trump-is-threatening-your-social-security-2020-09-02?mod=home-page",
    "text": "One way U.S. voters are being played during this presidential election campaign is the deceitful manner in which key issues are being framed for their consumption. Arguably the biggest and most important of these concerns the so-called “third rail” of American politics: Social Security. President Donald Trump has vowed to kill funding for this critical, gargantuan program that nearly 70 million Americans depend on. What? You haven’t heard Trump say he wants to kill Social Security’s funding? Actually, you have. Trump says he wants to kill the payroll tax — which is how Social Security is funded. Perhaps like many Americans, you’re unaware of how Social Security is financed. It comes from payroll taxes that are paid by you and your employer. The past four years have convinced me that there are many other things that Trump’s supporters don’t seem to understand either (trade/tariffs, regulations, the stock market, etc.) but I digress. “If victorious on November 3rd,” the president said on Aug. 8th, “I plan to forgive these taxes and make permanent cuts to the payroll tax.” He then added: “I’m going to make them all permanent.” So when Trump talks of a “payroll tax cut,” you might think that sounds great. A tax cut! But this is deceptive election year politics, designed to take advantage of voter ignorance. Anyone in the media that’s going along with Trump’s framing of this as a mere tax cut is also being played. Trump seems to think that killing the payroll tax will save companies big bucks (His 2017 corporate tax cut wasn't enough?) while increasing the take home pay of American workers. Bigger take home pay? Tens of millions of Americans don’t have pay — period — thanks to the economic collapse brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. Important sidebar: Note that Trump said in late February, when the U.S. had just 15 coronavirus cases, that we would soon be down to none — proof, he said, that he was an effective leader. “When you have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that’s a pretty good job we’ve done,” Trump said at the time. Yet as of this writing, the U.S., with about 4% of the world’s population, has more than six million cases — one of every four on the planet. Not that this and other gross miscalculations and bumbling has stopped Trump from believing — and actually looking into — how he could be added to Mount Rushmore, alongside Presidents Lincoln, Washington, Jefferson and Theodore Roosevelt. It doesn’t get more delusional than this except, perhaps, for kooky Trump advisers like economist Stephen Moore, and even Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who has said that Social Security could always be paid for by moving trillions of dollars from the government’s “general fund to those trusts funds.” Trillions of dollars from the general fund?  What trillions of dollars? The federal deficit for fiscal year 2019 that ended last Sept. 30 was $984 billion. It has nearly quadrupled this year to a staggering $3.7 trillion, and this will skyrocket even further if another round of pandemic aid gets passed. These sums — so vast as to be nearly incomprehensible — get added on to the national debt, which as of last week was $26.6 trillion, up 33.6% on Trump’s watch. Remember: Trump said he would eliminate the entire national debt — not the deficit, the national debt itself — in eight years, because of all the brilliant trade deals he would do. Here we are four years later and things are worse, far worse, than ever. Other White House advisers, seeing the political damage this kind of talk has inflicted in a tough election race, have walked back plans to kill Social Security’s funding. And yet Trump’s words speak for themselves. All this loose talk is an insult to the tens of millions of Americans who are heavily dependent on Social Security (and Medicare too). “Heavily dependent” is not hyperbole. Consider some numbers: According to the Social Security Administration, the average monthly benefit for recipients this year is $1,503. As modest as this is, it represents just about everything — “90% or more” of all income received by “21% of married couples and about 45% of unmarried persons. It’s probably difficult for wealthy men like Trump, Mnuchin (who moonlights as the chief trustee of the Social Security Trust Fund) and others to see, but there is a vast sea of poverty in the United States. Click here to read a recent MarketWatch column I wrote about seniors and poverty. I’m talking about men and women — tens of millions of American workers — who paid into the system over their entire working lives. They deserve more respect than the Trump administration is showing them — and the assurance that the U.S. government will, without fail, honor the obligations it has made to them. Since Trump’s base skews older, it’s reasonable to assume that many of them, too, are overly dependent on Social Security. They, and everyone else, must understand that when the president talks about a payroll tax cut, it doesn’t mean what it seems. Now the only thing I feel comfortable predicting with confidence is that my future will end up differently than I would have predicted, writes Chris Mamula.

    "title": "Traditional long-term care policies can still work",
    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/traditional-long-term-care-policies-can-still-work-2020-09-01?mod=home-page",
    "text": "I recently wrote that the market for long-term care insurance, which was growing rapidly 20 years ago, has shrunk dramatically. When the market boomed, insurers bet that over time policyholders would let their policies lapse. Instead, many more people who had long-term care insurance (which covers the cost of skilled care and assisted living or nursing home facilities) held on to their policies, and when they tapped into them to pay for care, insurers sometimes had to pay out benefits in the six-figure range. So, the companies jacked up prices and pushed regulators for aggressive rate increases for existing customers, while many insurers stopped writing new policies altogether. But there are still some good deals for people who want traditional long-term care policies. So, I contacted Brian Gordon, president of long-term care specialist MAGA Ltd. (Murray A. Gordon Associates, not Make America Great Again). The firm, which was started by his father Murray in 1975, is based in Bannockburn, Illinois. First of all, Gordon told me, there’s a myth that Medicare covers long-term care expenses; it covers only the limited costs of recovery from acute medical conditions, like a stroke. For the rest, you’re on your own. “We’ve always told our clients to anticipate Medicare doing nothing,” he said. Medicaid does pay for long-term care, but you’ll have to spend down your own assets before you qualify, and the quality of care can leave a lot to be desired. If you’re rich, on the other hand, you can pay out of pocket. “I’ve got clients today who can buy a nursing facility. They can live there by themselves and they would still have plenty of money left,” Gordon said. Long-term care insurance is best, he told me, for people with net assets of $500,000 and up. They can’t afford to pay the entire cost of an extended nursing home stay, and long-term care insurance could help them cover their care while preserving assets to leave to their heirs. How much coverage should you look for? “Most people we work with are looking to cover anywhere from about 50% to about 75% of the cost of care,” he told me. “So, if the cost of care is, say, $10,000 a month, my clients are usually looking at between about $5,000 and about $7,500 a month in benefits.” Gordon says his clients range in age from the 40s to the 70s, although it’s harder for older people to buy long-term care policies and the premiums are much higher. “I would say somewhere in our early, mid-50s is usually a good time to buy it,” he said. How much should you pay at that time? “Our average premium on a traditional long-term care plan is probably a little bit over $3,000 a year,” he said. Gordon prepared several hypothetical quotes from a major insurer for Retirement Weekly. The premium for a 55-year-old male who buys a policy that pays $170 a day ($5,000 a month) for three years with a 3% inflation adjustment would be around $2,000 a year. A woman of the same age with the same benefits would pay $1,200 a year more. (Women live on average about five years longer than men do.) Add another year to the benefit period and the premium would be about $300 higher for the man and $700 for the woman. A shared plan for a 55-year-old female/male couple costs just over $4,200 annually for a three-year benefit period and a bit more than $5,000 for four years. That couple discount amounts to $1,000 for three years of coverage and $1,200 for four years. Big age differences between spouses make it more complicated, but in this case, you’d pay just under 20% less for a joint policy than you would for coverage of two individuals. Since women tend to be in long-term care on average 1.5 years longer than men do, a four-year benefits term makes sense for them while three years should suffice for most men. You might look for more coverage in states like Hawaii and Connecticut, where semiprivate rooms in nursing homes cost around $12,000 a month, double what they cost in Texas or Oklahoma. And though some legacy plans include inflation riders of 5%, these days paying for 3% annual inflation protection is standard. (In the five years ending in 2018, costs of long-term care rose from 2% to 3.6% annually, according to Genworth Financial.) But the best reason to buy long-term care insurance may not be financial. “It signals to the family that when our minds were good and we were healthy, we made the decision to buy this insurance,” said Gordon. “It basically tells the family it’s OK to bring in home health care and it’s OK to put them in a nursing facility.” How much is it worth to know you won’t be a burden on your loved ones when you can no longer take care of yourself? That’s the real question to ask yourself as you consider all the options to cover long-term care. Copyright © 2020 MarketWatch, Inc. All rights reserved."

    "text": "As Americans have been forced to stay at home for work, school and even visits to the doctor, shares of cloud-services providers have soared. But there’s something else going on that points to a long-term trend investors need to know about: a housing shortage outside cities, and a boom in  home renovation and improvement. But variety is the spice of life — and an excellent tool to cut risk in your investment portfolio and avoid missing out on opportunities. Of course, an excellent way to play the home construction/renovation trend is through exchange traded funds that focus on appropriate industries. So we looked to three U.S. construction and home improvement-related ETFs, combined their holdings and removed their duplicates for a list of stocks. Taking the three ETFs together and eliminating duplicate holdings, we are left with a group of 69 stocks, 42 of which have had double-digit returns this year. So here’s the entire list, sorted by how well the stocks have performed this year. This is a lot of data — scroll the table to see all the information, which includes forward price-to-earnings ratios, percentage of “buy” ratings among sell-side analysts and 12-month price targets: Click on the tickers for more about each stock, including the companies’ business profiles. As always, if you are considering direct investments in any of the stocks listed here, you need to do your own homework to form an opinion of how well you expect the company to perform over the next several years. You can see that many of the best performers have gotten well ahead of the consensus price targets. Then again, there are 25 with majority “buy” ratings, and many are still expected by analysts to should double-digit gains over the next 12 months. It was another wild day for Kodak stock.

    "text": "WAYNESBORO, Va., Sept. 2, 2020 -- It comes as no surprise that the performing arts sector has been profoundly impacted by COVID-19. After all, it is a community that is usually the first to feel the pain---or joy--- of any shift in consumer behavior depending on the direction of change. This entire year has been a montage of cancelled performances and rescheduled events, as the arts community re-invents itself through live streaming, pod casts, social media and drive-in theater productions. Any town that has a rich cultural and vibrant artistic scene will do what it takes to preserve and support its arts community because their thriving town is living proof that supporting the arts plays a major role in building a stronger community. Educators, too, will tell you that young people develop critical thinking skills from exposure to art, theater and music.  (Employers might want to take note of this when looking for exceptional attributes in the hiring process.) Companies that seize the opportunity to support the arts know that it is arguably the smartest philanthropic investment a business can make. First Bank & Trust Company has built its 41-year-long reputation on being a community bank, and one of its most promising community partners has been the Wayne Theatre Alliance. Leonard Pittman, Senior Vice President and Commercial Lender for First Bank and Trust Company in Staunton, recently met with the Executive Director of Wayne Theatre, Tracy Straight, to make a donation in an effort to show support and promote solidarity during these challenging times. Tracy Straight commented on the impact of community awareness, \"Support like what First Bank & Trust Company has shown reinforces the sense of community the Wayne Theater brings to its loyal patrons.  As a community, we should never lose sight of what connects us.\" For Pittman, making the donation in a show of support was an easy decision.  \"The arts are what brings a community together.  Living without them seems unimaginable, especially if you're a community banker.\" About Wayne Theatre AllianceThe Wayne Theatre Alliance promotes the artistic, cultural, and educational opportunities and the economic vitality of Waynesboro and adjacent region through the operation and preservation of the Ross Performing Arts Center at the historic Wayne Theatre as a performing arts/conference facility.

The market for aerospace plastics has been segmented into polymer type, aircraft type, application and region.Based on type of polymer type, the market is segmented into PEEK, PMMA, PC, PPS and ABS. Among these polymer types, PEEK is dominating the market and is expected to maintain its dominance during the forecast period.Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) is an economical alternative to polycarbonate and is expected to register comparatively higher growth during forecast period. In the aerospace industry, it is extensively used in manufacturing the canopies, windshields, etc., of the aircraft. Further, for the military aircraft, PMMA is used as a substitute for glass to manufacture airplane windows. Further, based on aircraft type, the market is bifurcated into commercial and military. Among these sub segments, commercial aircraft is expected to command majority market share between 2020 and 2025. Based on region, the market is segmented into Asia-Pacific (APAC), Europe, North America and rest of the world.Among these regions, North America is the leading market for aerospace plastics, followed by Europe and Asia-Pacific. Notably, the demand is higher in North America, as key aircraft manufacturers like Boeing and Bombardier are based in the region.

Full press release with photos and video can be found at: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tz52y4hLGABoqSfT_Peam-kT1fP3PPm-smDfKu8Hzes/edit?usp=sharing SYDNEY, Sept. 2, 2020 -- Vow, an Australian based innovative food company developing meat products directly from animal cells, today announced the culinary demonstration of their multi-species meat platform. The 6 unique dishes were designed, prepared and plated by renowned Australian chefs Neil Perry and Corey Costelloe. This was an impressive demonstration of the company's technical ability and an important milestone on its journey to create meat products more delicious than any conventional animal meat. Neil Perry, Australia's most famous chef and founder of the Rockpool restaurant empire, is an advocate of Vow and helped design the dishes for the product demonstration. \"The work Vow is doing is awesome. Blending deep technology with the culinary world opens a new creative era in food, and does so in a way that's sustainable for future generations. I think that's an incredibly exciting thing to be a part of.\" Six different animal species were selected from Vow's diverse cell library and cultivated (grown from cells in a cultivator) for this product demonstration and included kangaroo, pig, lamb, alpaca, rabbit and goat. \"Until now the cultured meat industry has been focused on better ways of making the meat we most commonly eat today,\" said George Peppou, Co-founder & CEO of Vow. \"This milestone demonstrates we can grow the cells of any animal, not just those we can farm, marking a turning point for the cultured meat industry and our food system as a whole. To make food without compromise we must stop looking backward to how our ancestors produced and ate food and instead choose how we will eat in the future.\" \"This has been an exciting moment for us, and really shows what we're capable of technically,\" said Tim Noakesmith, Co-founder and Chief Commercial Officer of Vow. \"We started this company only 16 months ago and we've been able to grow to an insanely awesome team of 16 scientists, engineers and designers here in Australia. Our rapid progress has taken us out of the lab and into one of Australia's best kitchens and now we're turning our focus to building a meat prototype that outperforms the sensory experience of any conventional meat we know.\" Vow's mission is to make sustainable food both irresistible and available to billions of people. They are making entirely new meat products directly from the cells of animals instead of the animals themselves. Vow was founded in April 2019 and is based in Sydney, Australia.

Rise in digital initiatives for crop insurance and supportive government initiatives such as subsidies drive the growth of the global crop insurance market. However, high cost of premiums and lack of awareness among farmers hinder the market growth. On the other hand, untapped potential in emerging countries and expansion of services create new opportunities in the coming years. Get Instant Access – Download Free PDF Brochure: https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/request-sample/7156 Based on coverage, the multiple peril crop insurance (MPCI) segment contributed to the largest share in 2019, accounting for more than two-thirds of the global crop insurance market, and is projected to maintain its leadership status during the forecast period. Moreover, this segment is estimated to witness the highest CAGR of 7.1% from 2020 to 2027. This is due to its offering of a combination product along with perils covered by the standard loss of yield coverage under the crop insurance policy. The report also analyzes the crop-hail insurance segment. Based on distribution channel, the insurance companies segment accounted for nearly half of the global crop insurance market in 2019, and is expected to maintain its dominance during the forecast period. This is attributed to the innovative & attractive range of distribution techniques and utilization of multiple channels for distribution of its crop insurance services. However, the brokers/agents segment would witness the highest CAGR of 8.6% from 2020 to 2027. This is due to multiple options & alternatives for crop insurance provided by them.

This is due to farmers & ranchers in the U.S. striving to maintain economical crop production by acquiring crop insurance coverage. However, Asia-Pacific is expected to witness the highest CAGR of 7.9% from 2020 to 2027, owing to rise in agricultural production activity and adoption of advanced technologies in the region.

    "text": "CAMPBELL, Calif., Sept. 2, 2020 -- VivaLNK, a leading provider of connected healthcare solutions, has partnered with Mazzetti, a provider of healthcare building systems engineering solutions, to deploy rapid response patient monitoring solutions for COVID-19 in the U.S. VivaLNK's reusable wearable medical sensors have been deployed in China at over 15 hospitals throughout the COVID-19 outbreak. In the form of a small flexible patch, the sensors can continuously monitor patient temperature, heart rate and respiratory rate, sending data wirelessly via Bluetooth to the respective caregivers to monitor and respond accordingly. This multi-patient monitoring application can alert staff based on trends and thresholds, identifying the patient and location. With the upcoming flu season, coupled with the pandemic, the country may see a sharp increase in infectious respiratory diseases. Primary benefits of the system include the avoidance of cross infection by minimizing patient to caregiver contact, and caregiver time savings due to continuous automated monitoring. The wearable sensors applied to the body, transmit data wirelessly to an on-premise server through a network router. Multiple patient data are then consolidated to a central monitoring application for observation. Caregivers can then easily identify the patient and room location for response as necessary. \"VivaLNK medical wearable sensors were designed for remote patient monitoring, but due to its low cost, flexibility, and ease-of-use, we are seeing it deployed in rapid response situations within hospitals or facilities with low infrastructure,\" said Jiang Li, Founder and CEO of VivaLNK. \"As the pandemic continues to be unpredictable, we're preparing for the need to set up rapid response situations for patient monitoring,\" said Walt Vernon, CEO of Mazzetti. \"Deploying this technology ensures our local health system is prepared to handle the patient flow while maintaining superior care to those in need.\" For more information about VivaLNK, visit www.vivalnk.com.

Attend an Online MBA Information Session. The STEM-designated degree is an option for students who pursue a Rutgers Full-Time MBA, a Part-Time MBA as well as the Executive MBA. International students who complete the STEM MBA (like other STEM programs) are eligible to work up to three years in the U.S. without requiring sponsorship from an employer. The option allows students to pursue any of the traditional concentrations of study, such as supply chain management or marketing, but requires them to incorporate at least 50 percent of their program credits from curriculum identified as STEM. Doug Miller, associate dean of MBA programs and an associate professor of management, said the STEM designation was a natural step because Rutgers Business School was already providing the courses and experiences that would help students develop data-driven analytic skills for business use. More than 50 percent of the existing courses offered as part of the MBA curriculum require advanced mathematics or involve the management of technology, including operations analysis, data mining, business forecasting and quality management. \"The increasing demand for such skills allows Rutgers Business School to leverage its strengths in new ways to make this learning available to more students,\" Miller said. The STEM credit requirement will be easy to meet for students with concentrations such as finance, pharmaceutical management, supply chain management and analytics and information management. For students concentrating their studies in real estate or strategy and leadership, meeting the requirement may take more careful planning. Students who do choose to pursue a STEM MBA may select a concentration or customize a concentration depending on their career goals. Many of the traditional courses offered as part of the MBA program use case studies, experiential learning and collaboration to build knowledge and skills that are not tied to the use of math, science or technology. The option of earning a STEM MBA increases the strong reputation and return-on-investment of the Rutgers MBA program, which also provides students with access to world-class faculty and connections to an extensive network of alumni as well as a life-changing education. \"The ability to make data-driven decisions involves analysis of situations as well as data,\" Miller said. \"At Rutgers Business School, we're providing students with critical thinking and leadership qualities as well as technical skills.\" For more information on the Rutgers STEM MBA designation, contact Rutgers Business School's Office of Graduate Admissions: [email protected] or call 973-353-1234. https://www.business.rutgers.edu"

    "text": "BOSTON and LANSING, Mich., Sept. 2, 2020 -- Voatz, the Boston-based mobile voting platform, today announced the successful completion of a first-of-its-kind virtual convention with the Michigan Democratic Party. This year's convention was the first to virtually nominate candidates for the state Supreme Court, among other elected positions, for the November ballot. Forced to participate from their homes because of the COVID-19 pandemic, nearly 2,000 delegates both submitted signature nominations and voted for their preferred candidates on the mobile app downloaded to their smartphones. Besides the Michigan Supreme Court, candidates were nominated to the state Board of Education and boards at the University of Michigan, Michigan State University and Wayne State University. Roughly 91 percent of 2,092 credentialed delegates participated. This milestone marks the fourth convention that the Michigan Democratic Party has completed in collaboration with Voatz, with the prior three conventions occurring on-site in Lansing and Detroit and using the Voatz tablet voting system. This prior collaboration contributed to a smooth transition to an all-virtual convention for the party without disruption, and marks yet another compelling case for the benefit of piloting technology options that make elections resilient. \"There were so many unique challenges with this year's convention because of the pandemic, but the Voatz platform eased many of our concerns,\" said Chrisy Jensen, Executive Director of the Michigan Democratic Party. \"Voatz enabled our delegates to be verified remotely and participate through their smartphones. The convenience, safety and accessibility of voting this way was eye-opening for everyone who participated.\" Voatz's staff worked closely with the party to ensure voter education, training, and a smooth rollout of the platform for all users. The platform was also built in cooperation with disability rights advocates, including accommodations for the visually impaired. Those who did not use the Voatz app had access to voting through a help desk. \"We've always enjoyed working with the Michigan Democratic Party and this time, are proud to have helped them with their first-ever virtual convention,\" said Voatz Co-Founder and CEO Nimit Sawhney. \"These are such uncertain times in so many regards, including voting, and we wanted to ensure a seamless remote experience. We're happy to have seen such positive turnout from thousands of voters, who were able to cast their votes safely and securely.\" Voatz is an award-winning mobile elections platform that leverages cutting-edge technology (including biometrics and a blockchain-based infrastructure) to increase access and security in elections. Since 2016 Voatz has run 70 elections with cities, universities, towns, nonprofits, and both major state political parties for convention voting. Learn more here. The Michigan Democratic Party fights for families, seniors, students and veterans, and works to elect Democrats across the state while holding Republicans accountable across the board. http://voatz.com/"

    "text": "REDWOOD CITY, Calif., Sept. 2, 2020 -- Area 1 Security, the first and only preemptive Cloud Email Security and anti-BEC fraud provider, today announced the appointment of noted go-to-market sales and channel leader, Steve Pataky, as Chief Revenue Officer. Pataky will helm all of Area 1's global sales efforts as well as expanded partnership initiatives to scale and accelerate sales opportunities with VAR/Solution Providers, distributors, MSSPs, consultants and technology alliances. Pataky most recently led partner sales as an Advisor for Ubiq Security, and previously served as Chief Revenue Officer for SonicWall (and before that, VP of World Wide Channels and Alliances at FireEye). He brings to Area 1 a standout track record of building robust partner ecosystems and generating explosive growth for industry-leading cybersecurity companies. His broad experience also includes key global channel sales and development roles with NetScreen, Juniper Networks, Vertical Networks and 3Com. \"I'm thrilled by this opportunity to help propel Area 1's channel momentum in an industry that's rapidly transforming beyond the limitations of secure email gateways, spam filters, and other traditional defenses into its future of scalable cloud-native email security solutions,\" Pataky says. \"This is the perfect storm of the right solution at a critical time in the market and I look forward to bringing Area 1's breakthrough preemptive Cloud Email Security solution to a fast-growing ecosystem of security partners and their customers.\" Amid the current seismic shift toward cloud-based email and messaging, organizations have come under increased attack from sophisticated threat actors delivering cybercrime and fraud at near-exponential levels, including Business Email Compromise (BEC) fraud, supply chain phishing, ransomware, credential theft, and more. This has spurred a high demand for more effective, scalable cybersecurity — opening up multibillion-dollar growth and revenue opportunities for partners to strengthen their portfolios with Area 1's preemptive, comprehensive, and accountable Cloud Email Security solution. Area 1's two-tiered channel program enables partners to offer their customers a proven best-of-breed anti-phishing approach that eclipses conventional email security in every aspect. Phishing is responsible for 95 percent of major breaches, wreaking consequent harm to revenue, brand, and customer confidence. Area 1's mission-critical, seamless deployment, deep insight, and quick triage enable organizations to preemptively detect, intercept, and disable phishing attacks before arrival, and to prevent financial damages due to BEC fraud. Steve Pataky's notable record of leadership includes being a key part of divesting SonicWall out of Dell and rebuilding SonicWall's independent channel of more than 17,000 partners worldwide. Previously, as FireEye's Vice President of Worldwide Channels and Alliances, he engineered an extensive partner ecosystem and partner-leveraged sales promotions fundamental to FireEye's dynamic expansion. \"We're thrilled to have attracted a global leader of Steve's caliber, background, and deep commitment to our strategic channel initiative,\" said Area 1 CEO, Patrick Sweeney. \"Under his guidance, our channel expansion opens up a $10 billion cloud email security market for our partners, empowering them to help their customers migrate to a far more efficacious email security model.\" Area 1 is paving the way for customers to escape the confines of ineffectual, outdated traditional email security and join the revolution to Cloud Email Security. Area 1 modernizes email defense by uniquely defeating diverse threats and phishing-based financial fraud in the wild: Google-level web-crawling capabilities deliver advanced insights into the wild beyond the network perimeter, giving customers a 24-day time advantage. Area 1 Security's time-zero detections lead the industry with reliable verdicts that intercept and shut down phishing attacks before they launch.

    "text": "CHICAGO, Sept. 2, 2020 -- September is Dental Implant Awareness Month, sponsored by the American Academy of Implant Dentistry (AAID). This year's theme, \"Healthy Mouth, Healthy You!\" focuses on the health benefits of dental implants. \"Dental Implant Awareness Month is a great opportunity to raise awareness about dental implants as a healthy replacement for missing teeth,\" explains AAID President, Bernee Dunson, DDS, FAAID, DABOI/ID. \"Many people know that implants bring back beautiful smiles, but the life-changing benefits go beyond esthetics. It's important for people to understand that they help restore overall health.\" To kick off the month, the AAID launched a new public awareness campaign including an article and video to bring visibility to the long-term health consequences of missing teeth and the reasons why implants are a preferred replacement option. When an individual loses one or more teeth, it causes other issues that may not be noticeable right away. The article and video provide an overview of the benefits – including how they help preserve bone structure, prevent gum disease, restore healthy eating habits, and help bring back confidence. Dental implants are more than an investment in oral health, but physical and mental health. When performed by a skilled implant specialist, it is one of the safest, most precise and predictable procedures. AAID-credentialed dentists invest significant time and energy into dental implant-focused training. Because they have a thorough knowledge of all aspects of dental implants and treatment options, they understand the big picture — and they're dedicated to putting your needs and your health first. Beyond Dental Implant Awareness Month, the AAID's patient-facing website provides expert, state-of-the-art information about dental implants and includes a handy search tool for finding  AAID implant dentists: aaid-implant.org/find-an-implant-dentist/ To learn more about how dental implants can give you a healthier smile, visit: aaid-implant.org About the American Academy of Implant Dentistry (AAID):Founded in 1951, the AAID was the first organization in the United States dedicated to developing and improving dental implants.

    "text": "Foreign-exchange traders pushed the U.S. dollar to a new round of lows Tuesday before letting up, and currency watchers expect the greenback to remain under pressure on expectations the Federal Reserve will succeed in its attempt to drive inflation higher. There were no obvious catalysts for the initial Tuesday decline, but the dollar’s continued weakness comes after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell last week made clear that policy makers would tolerate above-target inflation as part of a new policy-making framework that abandons the central bank’s previous bias toward pre-emptively hiking interest rates when the labor market gets tight and signs of potential inflationary pressures build. “With Chair Powell cementing the negative real yield narrative for the dollar, there is little to suggest the current U.S. dollar bear trend is to stop, wrote analysts Francesco Pesole and Petr Krpata of ING, in a note. A resulting pickup in inflation expectations has dropped real yields — the yield on U.S. Treasurys minus expected inflation — to all-time lows. The real yield on the 10-year Treasury note on Tuesday stood near -1.08% after hitting an all-time low of -1.11% on Monday. The negative expected return makes the dollar less attractive to investors. The adoption of average inflation targeting and a tolerance for an inflation overshoot suggests interest-rate hikes “are a very distant proposition” and that U.S. real interest rates will remain low and may go even lower if the Fed succeeds in generating domestic inflationary pressure, they said. “None of these should strategically bode well for the dollar,” the analysts wrote, noting that high nominal and real rates were the key ingredients behind a stronger dollar in recent years. The dollar’s slide has been under way since spring, with the currency dropping back sharply after running to a more than three-year high in March as the pandemic-induced global economic collapse and accompanying financial market turmoil sparked a global scramble for dollars. As financial markets stabilized and central banks, particularly the Fed, stepped in to provide aggressive monetary stimulus alongside fiscal efforts by governments, the dollar has retreated. The Fed also moved to quench the global thirst for dollars by enhancing existing currency swap lines with major central banks and opening new ones. The dollar’s decline began to pick up steam in the summer, with the DXY falling 4% in July for its biggest one-month drop in nearly a decade. The dollar’s drop from its pandemic peak was already being attributed to falling U.S. real yields and expectations the global economy was poised to outperform the U.S. as the pandemic eventually runs its course. “The dollar cycle has turned because real yields have collapsed, in absolute and relative terms, and because the U.S. growth advantage relative to other major economies has been diminished,” said Kit Juckes, global macro strategist at Société Générale, in a Tuesday note. Related: Dollar could become a ‘crash risk’ if U.S. loses credibility, analyst warns Commodities are also seen benefiting from a weaker dollar, as it makes assets denominated in the unit cheaper to users of other currencies. Juckes argued, however, that last week’s Fed move was relatively “modest” after the policy makers in March proved their willingness to go far beyond what previous officials had done. Market participants, however, have embraced the policy changes without asking important questions, he said. Ahead of last week’s announcement, the Fed had already pledged to keep interest rates lower for far longer than previously anticipated, he noted. And, Juckes added, while the Fed’s willingness to allow inflation to move above its target for a time is a significant step, there’s little attention paid to the fact that the Fed has so far been unable to push inflation up to its 2% target any more than the Bank of Japan or the European Central Bank. “The currency has moved further than the shift in growth expectations so far would seem to justify,” he said, while bets on a falling dollar have pushed speculative positioning to an extreme, though “when that triggers a correction isn’t easily forecastable. ” Since its public offering, Rocket’s shares have risen 38%, helped by the company’s preliminary second-quarter earnings released in mid-August as part of financial disclosures to bondholders.

    "text": "That’s Mohamed El-Erian,  Allianz’s chief economic adviser,  explaining in an op-ed for the Financial Times how action in the options pits should be taken as a warning by retail investors who have been cashing in on the stock market’s relentless push higher in recent months. “The seemingly endless rally… gives the impression that prices are endorsed and supported by the entire professional investment community,” he said.  “After all, despite the vocal concerns over valuations having split away from underlying corporate and economic fundamentals, few fund managers have been willing to challenge the market by placing outright shorts. “ However, “sophisticated investors” are expressing their cautious views with the use of derivatives, and El-Erian says the mom-and-pop types should take note. “Much of this could be seen as market deepening were it not for one troubling fact: corporate and economic fundamentals have yet to reflect a sustained and convincing recovery from COVID-related damage,” he said. The rebound in consumption is slowing, initial jobless claims are back to the 1 million level for a second straight week, bankruptcies are rising, and, according to El-Erian, it’s looking like these short-term disruptions are about to become long-term scars. “Rather than a well-thought-out bet on the future, stocks reflect many investors’ resolute faith in a consistently favourable and predictable liquidity environment,” he wrote. “It is a backdrop anchored by reliable stimulus from central banks.” On the surface, the same can pretty much be said for what we’re seeing in the derivatives market, but there’s more to it than just that. “The fear of missing out on an unceasing equity rally has increasingly been expressed through call options,” El-Erian said. “Those who would normally short the market on concerns of excessive valuations appear to have no desire to be steamrollered once again by favourable liquidity and the strong ‘buy-the-dip’ conditioning that comes with that.” “It would take a big shock for markets to move significantly lower — such as a renewed sharp economic downturn, a considerable monetary or fiscal policy mistake, or market defaults and liquidity accidents,” he wrote. “But should such a move occur, the likelihood of further market turmoil would be high, especially given the current lack of a short base to buffer the downturn. This exposes small retail investors to big potential losses.” Shawn Langlois is an editor and writer for MarketWatch in Los Angeles. Follow him on Twitter @slangwise.

    "text": "Deal talks for TikTok’s U.S. operations have hit a snag over the key question of whether the app’s core algorithms can be included as part of a deal, according to people familiar with the matter. The algorithms, which determine the videos served to users and are seen as TikTok’s secret sauce, were considered part of the deal negotiations up until Friday, when the Chinese government issued new restrictions on the export of artificial-intelligence technology, according to people familiar with the matter. Now both sides are trying to figure out whether the order means the algorithms need Chinese government approval for transfer, and if so, whether Beijing would sign off. The complexity involved has reduced the chances that a deal could be completed any time soon. TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance Ltd., has said it will comply with the Chinese government order, and is trying to get clarity from Beijing on how to proceed with a sale if the new restrictions apply to its algorithms, some of the people said. For bidders, the idea of buying TikTok without the algorithms completely changes the outlook on what the companies are bidding for, other people familiar with the situation said. They believe a large portion of the value of TikTok is in the suggestion algorithms that keep users glued to the app. An expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.

    "text": "Google will pass on the cost of new European digital taxes to advertisers, incorporating these fees into its rates instead of paying them out of pocket. All three countries have instituted digital taxes within the last year, in an attempt to capture more of the revenues that technology giants generate within their borders. But investors worried that these digital taxes would hit Google’s bottom line will be relieved to hear that advertisers will bear the costs instead. Phil Smith, the director general of the ISBA, which represents British advertisers, said the move was “the inevitable outcome of the U.K.’s unilateral approach to digital taxation.” Starting November 1, a 2% fee will be added to invoices in the U.K., while customers in Austria and Turkey will have to pay a 5% fee on top of regular ad rates. These fees explicitly cover the cost of digital services taxes in the U.K. and Austria, and for Turkish customers represent “the complexity and cost of complying with regulations.” For now, Google won’t be extending fees covering digital taxes to all European countries that have imposed them, such as in France, which has committed to taxing tech giants this year regardless of whether an international tax standard for big tech is reached. Despite being relatively isolated from the economic impacts of the coronavirus pandemic, Google and Amazon have taken these fee decisions to protect their finances. Google’s revenues in the second quarter of 2020 remain only marginally lower than the year before, while Amazon’s share price is up over 48% year-to-date. Meanwhile, the advertising sector is in a rut, with marketing budgets being slashed across the board as companies cut costs to meet the economic challenges of the pandemic. “Digital service taxes and other regulations increase the cost of digital advertising. Typically, these kinds of cost increases are borne by customers,” a Google spokesperson said. “We’ll also continue to encourage governments globally to focus on international tax reform rather than implementing new, unilateral levies.” Opinion: Why the U.K. and France play against type in digital tax row with the U.S. This cartoon apparently wasn’t fit to print, and it reportedly cost Michael de Adder his job after the internet got hold of it.

    "text": "The 2020 election race between incumbent President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden is a coin toss,  LPL financial chief market strategist Ryan Detrick says. Indeed, a number of polls and betting odds indicate that a once-yawning lead enjoyed by Biden is starting to wane. Real Clear Politics shows that the Democratic nominee is leading Trump by 6.2 percentage points, based on an average of national polls, and his advantage in so-called battleground states, stands at a relatively razor-thin margin of 2.7 percentage points, according to a separate RCP poll average. But Detrick says that a simple equity-market chart has been the best predictor of U.S. presidential elections since 1984, proving 100% accurate—and is 87% accurate since 1928. The LPL analyst says that a chart of the S&P 500’s performance in the three-month period ahead of Election Day, which is Nov. 3 this year, has proven accurate over the past nearly four decades. Detrick writes that a positive return over that three-month period “may signal an increased likelihood that the incumbent party may win, while stock market losses during the same period have tended to predict an opposition party win.” To be sure, the strategist acknowledges that the market isn’t the economy and that millions of people are out of work due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, but notes that a look at what stocks may say about the outcome of election may be one thing for investor to consider as they prepare for an uncertain stretch of trade ahead of that key vote. “The unique circumstances around this year’s pandemic seem to add plausibility that this could be the first time in almost 100 years that this signal may be wrong—especially if the stock market and economy continue to recover between now and Election Day,” he wrote. All that said, Detrick said that Trump is still contending with an even bigger factor that could stymie his re-election chances beyond the stock-market gains: a recession. “History has shown that when a recession has occurred during the two years before the election, the incumbent president has tended to lose,” the analysts wrote. “ In fact, the economy incredibly has predicted the winner of every presidential election going back to President Calvin Coolidge,” he added. That statistic also offers its own inherent caveat since the recession that ensued in this pandemic is a global one and occurred a stunning and historic rate. But the president’s handling of the current pandemic and the ensuing public-health crisis may be the one thing that voters weigh against or in favor of Trump. MarketWatch columnist Mark Hulbert, in an article on Tuesday pointing out the fallibility of trying to spot correlations between stock performance and election outcomes, says that investors should “be on your guard…for those using the stock market to predict who will win the White House in November.” Notably, he says that the historical data can be contorted to say a number of things but also that the range period, including a three-month stretch before the election, is arbitrary and should raise a caution for observers. On the heels of a huge month for stocks in August, our call of the day says investors need to get ready for at least two pullbacks this year, with history as a guide.

    "title": "Unloved oil companies could lead low-carbon transformation, new Goldman report says",

    "text": "It is hard to imagine a less-loved sector than energy. There is a whole host of worries. In the short term, there is less of a need for energy of any sort, since economies are still running well below capacity due to the coronavirus pandemic. There is also the potential of higher taxes in a Joe Biden administration, and, bigger picture, climate change, which not only makes the sector unpopular to environmentally-focused investors but also is likely to prompt tougher regulation. Which is where an interesting piece of research from Goldman Sachs comes in. Entitled “Reimaging Big Oil: The Age of Transformation,” the bank says a new European Commission rule kicking in by the end of next year can actually drive this shift. It will require companies to classify their activities with regard to sustainability. “Big Oils have always been vertically integrated in oil, from production to downstream processing, trading and retail, and have been able over recent years to develop and manage complex energy supply chains in natural gas. We believe that they have the capability to transition from international oil companies to integrated energy companies and see them integrating vertically in low carbon power, leveraging their brand and trading capabilities to acquire power customers,” say the analysts, led by Michele Della Vigna. Under what is called the EU taxonomy, Goldman analysts see five categories that are eligible to be labeled as sustainable in which Big Oils have a material or growing presence: low-carbon electricity; petrochemicals manufacturing; biofuels manufacturing; clean hydrogen and carbon sequestration. They estimate European big oil companies could increase their share of taxonomy-eligible revenue to 25% by 2030, from 7% now, and 50% of capital expenditure, from 10% today. One issue: most of these low-carbon businesses aren’t consolidated and remain off balance sheet at the moment, the analysts say. “We therefore view that as the low carbon electricity business expands, it will become more important for these businesses to be consolidated and for sufficient visibility over these businesses to be provided by the companies,” say the Goldman team. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease official, said a COVID-19 vaccine could be available earlier than expected if ongoing clinical trials produce overwhelmingly positive results. The National Institutes of Health said there are insufficient data to recommend either for or against the use of convalescent plasma for the treatment of COVID-19 — approved on an emergency basis by the Food and Drug Administration after White House pressure — and should not be considered standard of care. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued an order forbidding evictions of tenants who can’t pay rent due to the coronavirus pandemic through the end of the year. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are set to resume stimulus talks, though White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said aid to state and local governments remains a key stumbling block.

    "title": "Only 19% of Tesla analysts say buy the stock while investors remain ‘insatiable’",
    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/only-19-of-tesla-analysts-say-buy-the-stock-while-investors-remain-insatiable-2020-09-01?mod=home-page",
    "text": "There is an old Wall Street saying that investing isn’t about being right or wrong, it’s about making money. No one understands that better than an investor in Tesla Inc.’s stock. The financial fundamentals and the historical valuations of earnings suggest the market is wrong about the electric vehicle (EV) maker’s stock price, according to the overwhelming majority of Tesla analysts. But the stock keeps rising and Tesla investors keep making money. No one is making more money than Elon Musk, Tesla’s chief executive officer, largest shareholder and arguably its most important cheerleader, who just became the third-richest person in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak, who has been bearish on Tesla since Jan. 23 2019, when the stock closed at $57.52, put it this way in a note to clients: Spak raised his price target to $290 from $170, but his target was still 42% below Monday’s closing price. See related: His short position just got ‘obliterated,’ but this Tesla bear isn’t giving up. Also read: Tesla takes advantage of stock’s best month in 7 years with $5 billion offering. There are some fundamental reasons for investors being right to buy, as Tesla has been profitable for four straight quarters, while Wall Street was wrong to expect losses in three of the past four quarters. And despite concerns about the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, Tesla delivered way more EVs than expected during the second quarter. While the 5-for-1 stock split Tesla announced on Aug. 11 didn’t improve the company’s fundamentals in any way, investors were right to buy or hold on to their shares, for now, as the price has charged up more than 80% since the announcement through Monday. Read more: Tesla stock rally accelerates further into record territory after split takes effect. Despite such strong investor conviction, 81% of analysts don’t recommend buying. Of the 36 analysts surveyed by FactSet, only seven, or 19%, have the equivalent of buy ratings on Tesla’s stock. And only one of those analysts, Jefferies’s Philippe Houchois, had a price target — $500 — that was above Monday’s closing price. Meanwhile, half the analysts had the equivalent of hold ratings and 11 analysts, or 31%, had the equivalent of sell ratings. The average price target of all the analysts was $261.85, according to FactSet, which implied a 47% drop from Monday’s closing price. Most of what analysts have been wrong about Tesla has taken place over roughly the past five months. At the end of March, when the COVID-19 crisis was full blown, there were the same number of bearish analysts as there are now and the average stock price target was $101.86, just 2.8% below the March 31 closing price of $104.80. With the stock’s gain since then, Tesla’s market capitalization increased to $464.3 billion as of Monday’s close, which was the seventh highest among U.S. companies. RBC’s Spak suggested that what may also keep supporting the stock is that given the sheer market valuation of Tesla, many portfolio managers have to add to positions “just to keep pace.” He also believes investors have been willing to show more patience and look further into the future to value the stock. “We still view Tesla as fundamentally overvalued and having to grow into its valuation,” Spak wrote. Spak recognizes that Tesla is clearly ahead of its competition, has relatively inexpensive access to capital, the ability to attract talent, an “incredible” brand, and understands that “narrative, momentum and other factors” can impact the stock price. But he still believes that ultimately, a company’s value is related to fundamental factors. Basically, he’s suggesting that one of the biggest risk factors to Tesla’s stock isn’t good or bad fundamental news, but how investors value that news. The next major potential news catalyst is Tesla’s “battery day” scheduled for Sept. 22, of which Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said recently he’s expecting a number of potential “game changing” developments. One of those developments is the “million mile” battery, which in theory will support an EV for 1 million miles, which could put Tesla miles ahead of its traditional gasoline-powered automotive competitors. That said, Ives is one of the analysts that doesn’t recommend buying — he’s at hold — while his price target of $380 suggests the stock could fall 24%. For those looking for actual fundamental risks, the following are just some of those included in the more than 20 pages of “risk factors” Tesla lists in its latest quarterly report filed on July 28. So far, those risks haven't mattered to Tesla investors. • “We are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer.” • “We have been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by the global COVID-19 pandemic, the duration and economic, governmental and social impact of which is difficult to predict, which may significantly harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.” • “We have experienced in the past, and may experience in the future, delays or other complications in the design, manufacture, launch, and production ramp of our vehicles, energy products, and product features, or may not realize our manufacturing cost targets, which could harm our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.” • “Our future growth and success is dependent upon consumers’ willingness to adopt electric vehicles and specifically our vehicles. We operate in the automotive industry, which is generally susceptible to cyclicality and volatility.” • “Any issues or delays in meeting our projected timelines, costs and production at or funding the ramp of Gigafactory Shanghai, or any difficulties in generating and maintaining local demand for vehicles manufactured there, could adversely impact our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition.” • “If our vehicles or other products that we sell or install fail to perform as expected, our ability to develop, market and sell our products and services could be harmed.” • “The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and we may not be successful in competing in these industries. We currently face competition from new and established domestic and international competitors and expect to face competition from others in the future, including competition from companies with new technology.” The COVID-19 vaccine candidates being developed by Moderna Inc. and BioNTech and Pfizer Inc. will require stringent standards for refrigeration, and that may hamper how they are distributed to the hundreds of millions of Americans expecting to receive them.

    "title": "An expert’s guide to road-tripping with your dog",
    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/an-experts-guide-to-road-tripping-with-your-dog-2020-09-02?mod=home-page",
    "text": "Even in the heart of a COVID-19 pandemic…make that especially in the heart of a COVID-19 pandemic, the summer road trip is a traditional taste of freedom that’s been celebrated since the automobile was invented. Inviting your dog to join you on these highway adventures makes you a much better person (just ask your pup). Keep in mind, however, that it’s going to take a little bit of planning. Nothing major, just some smart forethought and consideration for your 4-legged traveling companion. If you’re reading this story on your phone as your road-trip vehicle idles in the driveway, your dog in the seat next to you and you’re waiting for the Sherpas to finish packing the car, stop. You’ll still have a great road trip, but you should have started thinking through this journey with the dog a few weeks earlier. That’s when you would have gathered your pooch’s essential traveling tools like vaccination records, medicines, and a current dog tag with your mobile number on it. Of course, your dog has an ID microchip implanted because you love him/her, right? OK, be sure that the chip number is loaded into your smartphone. A pre-trip trip to the vet isn’t a bad idea either just to make sure everything is in order. And vet runs are always good practice for how well a dog travels. Another important pre-road trip consideration is which vehicle to take. If you’re a one-car family, of course, that’s academic. But if you have a choice, choose the SUV that has AC vents in back (your dog will worship you if you can get cooling air to the rear seats where most road trip dogs travel). Summer heat is unforgiving, especially to canines. Although SUVs work best for road trips with dogs — lots of extra gear comes along — cars will work just fine, too, and you won’t get any complaints out of Muttley either way. The important thing is to try to keep the second row — aka, the back seat — clear of luggage and gear so that your dog can take ownership of the space and feel secure in it. Leather seating cleans easier, but if you’re a big-dog owner, make sure you protect the rear seat from scratching nails with a pet hammock seat cover designed to keep your dog safe and protect the seat from natural pet behavior. It’ll also make cleaning up after the trip — dogs are dogs and they never learn to clean up their rooms, after all — infinitely easier. Other essentials to prep before you go are a no-spill water dish, treats (of course), toys (of course, of course), and a few items from home that carry your scent to comfort him, like a favorite blanket or even your pup’s bed. Don’t forget to pack food (pack about 15%t extra for travel) and food bowls. If you plan on camping or hiking, a first aid kit designed specifically for dogs is a good addition to your list. All you have to do now is get your dog’s Instagram account set up and you’re ready to travel. 1. I’m thirsty. 2. I have to pee. These sweetly ironic rules should come as no surprise. Water helps dogs function, flush toxins, regulate body temperature, and keep noses wet for optimal sniffin’. And it keeps them peeing throughout the day. When you’re on the road with a canine companion, always keep those two facts in mind as priorities. Pee stops are a good chance to get a little exercise, too, for both the dog and the driver. Speaking of exercise, no matter where you are on the journey, don’t hesitate to ask your smartphone for the location of the nearest dog park (every city and town has at least one) or if you’re doing a coastal trip, a dog beach. Both of these places are great shared communities where the natural practice is to stay at least 6 feet apart without seeming unfriendly. That’s true all across America, from the Union Square Dog Run in Manhattan to the Cayucos Dog Beach along California’s Highway 1. Plus, a worked out, sleeping dog travels best. Camping with dogs is a special kind of blast. These days, however, motels (and many hotels) seem to be getting more dog-friendly than ever. It’s easy to find a place where your tail-wagger can bunk with you free or for a very small fee. Many restaurants, too, especially now that coronavirus has forced so many dining establishments to expand their outdoor seating, are happy to accommodate with a big smile, a full menu and a fresh bowl of water for Fido. A road trip seen through eyes of a dog keeps car travel fresh. It may not always be super simple, but it is always rewarding and guaranteed to bring you and your companions, human and nonhuman, closer together. Treat every meal, motel stay and pee stop as a teaching and learning moment — a chance to refine your pup’s already stellar behavior. So relax and go have fun. If you and your dog have found a rhythm together at home, you’ll absolutely find one on the road. This story originally ran on Autotrader.com.

    "title": "Opinion: This graduate degree will be a job magnet as the world recovers from COVID-19",
    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-graduate-degree-will-be-a-job-magnet-as-the-world-recovers-from-covid-19-2020-09-01?mod=home-page",
    "text": "At the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, close to eight of 10 MBA students say they are not excited about the coming fall semester because the coronavirus pandemic has forced classes online. At UCLA’s Anderson School of Management, newly admitted international students are outraged that they cannot defer their admission to the school’s MBA program even if they cannot get a student visa to come to the U.S. At New York University’s Stern School of Business, students are demanding the reversal of a 3.5% increase in MBA tuition during COVID-19 and asking for a 5% to 10% discount on the price of their degrees because of the shift to virtual classes. Add to all of the anxiety and frustration the fact that some graduates from the most prestigious business schools, including Harvard and Stanford universities, saw their summer internships and full-time job offers clawed back by companies due to the COVID recession. Many more are deeply worried about their prospects for landing a job over the next year as still more companies freeze budgets and hiring plans. So is this a time to apply to an MBA program and go even further into debt? You better believe it is, and here’s why. A recession and a health crisis, no matter how severe, will not last forever. But while it lasts, many will find their opportunities to advance at work diminished or completely curtailed. Many more have already found themselves on unemployment. By the time this year’s incoming MBA students graduate in 2023, it is almost a certainty that both COVID-19 and the economic downturn will be in the rearview mirror. The Class of 2023 will inevitably graduate into a fully recovered economy, better prepared to take full advantage of the upturn. No less crucial, they will have been the beneficiaries of not merely the business basics or of the leadership development a strong MBA program provides; they will be steeped in both data analytics, specifically how to smartly harness massive datasets for decision making, and how to leverage new technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, to gain important efficiencies in a business moving forward. Of all the graduate degrees you could earn, an MBA from a highly selective business school is pretty much a no-brainer investment. The top five schools for average starting pay last year — base salary plus signing bonus — are all big names, led by the Wharton School at $172,016, NYU Stern ($168,291), Stanford ($168,226), Dartmouth College’s Tuck School of Business ($166,251), and the University of Virginia’s Darden School of Business ($165,292). In all, 12 schools in the top 25 of U.S. News’s MBA ranking report starting salaries above $160,000, and 17 above $150,000. “If you stayed at work in 2021, your career options and earning potential in 2023 would be more limited if you had gone to business school,” noted Soojin Kwon, managing director of full-time MBA admissions and program at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business. Why? Kwon notes that students will gain three advantages by going back to school that they won’t get by staying in a job during the pandemic. “One, you’ll meet with and learn from hundreds of smart, ambitious and interesting people you wouldn’t have met if you didn’t go to business school,” Kwon said at a recent panel discussion for Poets & Quants.  “Two, you’re going to learn how to network and interview for jobs in an industry or function that you’re interested in going into, and most, if not all MBA recruiters this year are planning to do virtual recruiting. So you’re going to learn how to interview in the format in which recruiters are going to be recruiting. In addition, she said, “You’re going to gain access to a network of tens of thousands of business school alumni and hundreds of thousands of alumni in the broader university community. You could absolutely find another job through LinkedIn, but it’s no secret that you’re more likely to get a response if you have some kind of connection, and an MBA from a top school with the support of alumni provides that invaluable connection for life.” During the Great Recession of 2008-2009, the job situation was just as miserable and prospects for many MBAs appeared so dim that some openly questioned their decision to borrow money to get the degree. Robert Bruner, then dean of the University of Virginia’s Darden School of Business, found himself having to defend the value of the MBA. He rose to the challenge, and his points then made much sense now. Education adds significant value to human potential. “Generally, research finds real rates of return on investment upwards of 10% and as high as 50%. And there is a correlation between years in school and earning power but that’s only the quantitative part. Every year, students graduate who are more self-confident, better communicators, and more promising leaders than when they enrolled. And they have joined an alumni network that has helped in good times and bad.” Indeed, long-term thinking beats short-term thinking all the time. Young professionals have a long career ahead of them. “With the benefits of modern medicine, you can probably look forward to a career of 50 years,” Bruner wrote. “Are you judging the worth of an MBA by only the first job you get out of B-school? Take the long view. If you could discount the marginal benefits of an MBA from a competitive school over the next 50 years, I’d guess that they well exceed the costs. Don’t discount the future too steeply.” Truth is, you can bet with certainty that tough times will again appear once this pandemic is under control and the economy recovers. The ability to assess and bear sensible risks is the core of business and entrepreneurship. Pursuing a graduate degree in business to learn valuable skills, cultivate one’s leadership potential, and acquire a supportive network of connected professionals is a risk worth taking. John A.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/uk-house-prices-surge-to-all-time-high-in-august-2020-09-02?mod=home-page",
    "text": "House prices in the U.K. surged to an all-time high in August, fueled by pent-up demand and record low mortgage rates, according to new figures from Nationwide. Britain’s biggest building society said prices jumped by 2% in August, following a 1.8% rise in July, marking the highest monthly increase since February 2004. Annual house price growth jumped to 3.7% last month from 1.5% in July. The average price was £224,123 ($298,864) in August, up from just under £170,000 10 years ago, Nationwide said. Robert Gardner, Nationwide’s chief economist, said the bounce back in prices reflects the unexpectedly rapid recovery in housing market activity since the easing of lockdown restrictions. “This rebound reflects a number of factors. Pent-up demand is coming through, where decisions taken to move before lockdown are progressing. Behavioral shifts may also be boosting activity, as people reassess their housing needs and preferences as a result of life in lockdown,” he said. The housing market was hit hard in March at the height of the lockdown, as estate agents were forced to close their offices and viewings weren’t allowed. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the next few months are crucial for Barratt because, while the group demonstrated its strength during the lockdown, an extended recession would prove an even tougher test. “The taxpayer funded furlough scheme, mortgage holidays and a ban on evictions are all due to be unwound in the autumn, which all could have major implications on demand for housing going forward,” she said. Read:U.K. jobs picture looks bleak with 7.5 million furloughed or away from their job Shares in Barratt rose 6.91% in early morning London trading. Gardner said that the trends look set to continue in the near term, further boosted by Chancellor Rishi Sunak’s recently announced stamp duty holiday — the transfer tax paid when buying a home. However, Gardner cautioned that most forecasters expect labor market conditions to weaken significantly in the quarters ahead, as a result of the after effects of the pandemic and as government support schemes wind down. “If this comes to pass, it would likely dampen housing activity once again in the quarters ahead,” Gardner said. VirnetX Holding Corp.  received a positive court ruling Wednesday, as the  internet security software and technology company disclosed that the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas has denied Apple Inc.'s  motion for relief from a judgment in the VirnetX vs. Apple patent case. The ruling is related to the case in which VirnetX was awarded total damages of $439.7 million as Apple was found to have infringed on VirnetX's patents. In February, Apple was denied a rehearing of the case. VirnetX's stock was still inactive in premarket trading, while Apple shares gained 1.8% toward record territory. Year to date, shares of VirnetX have rallied 35.3%, Apple has run up 82.8% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average  has tacked on 0.4%.

    "text": "My husband and I have been married for almost eight years. Prior to marriage we had a prenuptial agreement made, where his RV and truck remained his to do whatever with, as my home and car remained mine. His RV is his pride and joy, and his “man cave” on wheels. I recently learned that his RV is “upside down.” He owes $75,000 more on it than it’s worth. My concern is that if something happens to him, I will end up with a lien on my home. My name is not on the RV, nor is his name on my home. Your help and thoughts are very much appreciated. Thank you. That was a clear prenuptial agreement. What’s yours is yours and what’s his is his, and anything you earn during your marriage is, I presume, shared. More or less. It sounds like you want to commingle your lives, but not your finances. Boys love their toys and he clearly takes great pride in his man cave on wheels, and it was and is important to him that it’s his, and his alone. That’s good news for you: You are not liable for this debt, if his name alone is on the loan. In community-property states — Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin — debt incurred during a marriage is deemed “community” responsibility. That is, both spouses are liable for that debt. In Alaska, newlyweds can choose to opt into community property rules. In other common-law states, spouses can incur debt on credit cards and RV loans during their marriage, and they are solely responsible for them. The Moneyist: My mother’s will says her boyfriend can live in her home after she dies. Can I still kick him out if the deed is transferred to me? There is one major exception to these rules, according to the American Bankruptcy Institute. You are liable for medical debts of your spouse under a legal theory called the Doctrine of Necessities. “The necessities rule is not limited to medical bills. It could apply to utilities, rent, food, clothing and any other necessities, but the most common lawsuit utilizing this legal concept is in the collection of medical debts,” it says. (At least two states, Virginia and Alabama, challenged this.) “In Nebraska, when you marry someone you also marry their future medical debts. If your spouse incurs medical debts during the marriage, you are liable for the debt. Even if the bills only come in the name of your spouse. Even if you did not sign for the debts. Even if you did not authorize the treatment. Even if you are separated. In Nebraska, when you marry someone you also marry their future medical debts. This doctrine has been accepted in Nebraska courts,” the institute adds. The Moneyist:My husband and I are worth $3.7 million, but I’m afraid I’ll spend my way into the poor house if he dies. When I was single, I bounced checks. What can I do? This does not, however, account for the indirect costs of a spouse incurring debts. You started your marriage with your eyes open, so you should continue in that spirit. Organize a monthly budget so you know where your red lines are on spending, and how much you need to earn to keep the books balanced, and put money aside for an emergency fund. You may also want to see if your husband can cut back on his spending to pay off his RV debt sooner rather than later. You’re a team. Worst-case scenario: If your husband cannot pay off the debt owed on his RV, it would obviously be repossessed by the company. If you or he lost his job, on the other hand, presumably the other spouse would shoulder the burden and help the other out. If he asks you to help out with the payments on his RV? That’s another question entirely. Hopefully, that won’t happen, Mary Ellen, and you and your husband will have a long and happy life together, and a few memorable trips in his RV.

    "text": "So much for playing videogames to escape reality — the 2020 U.S. presidential election has now even infiltrated “Animal Crossing.” Yes, the millions of people playing “Animal Crossing: New Horizons” since it was released for the Nintendo Switch in March, in which players build their own virtual islands populated by cute critters, can now add Joe Biden campaign signs to their digital front yards. Biden’s presidential campaign revealed its “Animal Crossing” partnership on Tuesday. “Show your Biden/Harris pride virtually!” it declared on its official campaign store, along with QR codes for players to scan and add the free political insignia all over their islands. The designs include the official Biden-Harris logo, a Team Joe logo, a “Joe” Pride logo, as well as a print of three aviator sunglasses in red, white and blue. “’Animal Crossing’ is a dynamic, diverse, and powerful platform that brings communities together from across the world,” Christian Tom, director of digital partnerships for the Biden campaign, said in a statement. “It is an exciting new opportunity for our campaign to engage and connect Biden-Harris supporters as they build and decorate their islands.” And the virtual campaign signs fit into the Biden camp’s pandemic playbook of hosting more online events, live-streamed fundraisers and speeches, while Trump has continued to campaign in person. Reps from Nintendo did not immediately respond to a MarketWatch query about whether the Biden campaign had to pay for those virtual signs to be available in the “Animal Crossing” game. Trump’s reelection campaign has not officially created campaign signs or T-shirts for “Animal Crossing,” although players can make their own — and in fact, have already done so. There are Trump and MAGA insignia on many individuals’ islands. CNN noted that, so far, there actually appear to be a few dozen more “MAGA” and “Trump” designs created by “Animal Crossing” gamers than Biden designs. Trump campaign deputy national press secretary Samantha Zager mocked Biden’s videogame gambit on Tuesday. “This explains everything: Joe Biden thinks he’s campaigning for president of ‘Animal Crossing’ from his basement,” she told CNN. “The Trump campaign will continue to spend its resources campaigning in the real world with real Americans.” Many people on social media also groaned at the Biden campaign’s “Animal Crossing” signs, as well, recalling Hillary Clinton calling on voters to “Pokemon Go to the polls” while she was running against Trump in 2016, citing another Nintendo gaming title. This isn’t the first time that political movements have made a mark in “Animal Crossing,” however. Players have also added Black Lives Matter flags and T-shirts to the game.

    "text": "The German Bundestag decided on Tuesday to launch a full inquiry into the downfall of payment company Wirecard, which filed for insolvency in June after €1.9 billion in cash were found to be missing from its accounts. Lawmakers want to probe possible government failures to uncover the scandal even as evidence accumulated over the last year. - Wirecard’s former chief executive Markus Braun is in custody on accusations of running a criminal enterprise that defrauded creditors of €3.2 billion. Braun and other Wirecard executives deny any wrongdoing. The company’s former chief operating officer, Jan Marsalek, has fled Germany and his whereabouts is unknown. - Both finance minister Olaf Scholz and Germany’s top financial regulator, BaFin, have been accused of turning a blind eye to Wirecard’s problems, first reported by the Financial Times in January, 2019, because the company was seen as a German fintech success story. BaFin even originally filed criminal complaints against the journalists who first uncovered the fraud. - “A picture has emerged that those fraudsters had it pretty easy,” said Florian Toncar, an opposition MP from the centrist Free Democratic Party. Lawmakers notably want to establish why Chancellor Angela Merkel lobbied for Wirecard during a trip to China in September, 2019, even as allegations of dubious accounting had already surfaced. The outlook: The inquiry could prove embarrassing for the two ruling coalition parties, Merkel’s conservative CDU and Scholz’s social-democratic SPD, one year before the general election scheduled in the fall of 2021. But the impact on the political careers of both parties’ leaders won’t be the same: Merkel is retiring next year, whereas Scholz will be running as his party’s candidate for the chancellor job.

    "text": "Credit Suisse Group AG said Wednesday that the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority, or Finma, has decided to open enforcement proceedings related to the surveillance scandal that has hit the reputation of the Swiss bank. The bank said it \"takes note of the decision\" and \"will continue to fully cooperate with Finma.\" \"The board of directors and the executive board of Credit Suisse agree and unequivocally affirm that the observation of employees is not part of the culture of Credit Suisse,\" it said. No further comments will be made until the authority presents its findings, the bank said. The spying scandal, stemming from the surveillance of two Credit Suisse executives, began in September last year and led to the resignation of Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam. Mr. Thiam said he hadn't known about the surveillance before it became public and regretted it had happened. Apple Inc. shares  are up 1.7% in premarket trading Tuesday after J.P. Morgan analyst Samik Chatterjee raised his price target to $150 from a split-adjusted $115. Chatterjee wrote that \"investors have widely acknowledged the rich valuation\" of Apple's stock after the company became the first in the U.S. to notch a $2 trillion valuation in late August, but he still sees room to run for the shares. \"While the $2 trillion market cap valuation in itself is a significant milestone, that Apple shares crossed it in a year with significant COVID-19 disruption testifies to the recurring nature of not only its services, but also its products, such that investors are now willing to pay a services-like premium on the entire earnings stream and a modest premium on account of expectations for further revenue/earnings upside,\" Chatterjee said in a note to clients. Also on Tuesday, Bloomberg reported that Apple has asked its suppliers to build at least 75 million 5G iPhones in the coming months, which is similar to what the company asked for during its prior launch, a signal that Apple is seeing stability in its business despite the COVID-19 crisis. Apple shares have gained 60% over the past three months as the Dow Jones Industrial Average  has increased 12%. Copyright © 2020 MarketWatch, Inc. All rights reserved."

    "title": "This university created its own COVID-19 test and is testing students twice a week — but is it enough to prevent an outbreak?",
    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-university-created-its-own-covid-19-test-and-is-testing-students-twice-a-week-experts-are-watching-to-see-if-its-enough-to-prevent-an-outbreak-11598648724?mod=home-page",
    "text": "Over the roughly week and a half that Ian Katsnelson has been back at his college, the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, the junior has developed a “mini competition” with his friends to see who can finish the process of taking their COVID-19 tests the fastest. “The hardest part for sure is garnering enough saliva,” Katsnelson said of the rapid saliva test, which was created by scientists at the school. He’s perfecting his strategy for his trips to the tents where testing takes place: “I’ve built up my saliva in line before I’ve even gotten inside the tent, so I can get in and get out real quick.” Hallie Workman, a PhD candidate in communications at U of I said, “there’s a lot of scouting that goes on” as students try to find out which of the more than a dozen testing tents on campus have the shortest line. “I have my tent in my time of day that always works well,” Workman, 30, said. “You just sit there trying not to make eye contact with people as you dribble spit into a tube.” These were just some of the rituals that marked an unusual first week of classes at the University of Illinois, which is requiring students, faculty and staff accessing campus to get tested for COVID-19 twice a week as part of its reopening plan. As colleges across the country have sent students home or back to remote classes amid COVID outbreaks, officials at the University of Illinois are hopeful that their approach to mitigating the pandemic’s spread on campus — which includes a test developed at the school that is now being performed under the Federal Drug Administration’s emergency use authorization — will be enough to keep students in some in-person classes through November.  It’s not a small undertaking. The school had 51,000 students in the fall of 2019. Since July 6, the school has processed 121,333 COVID tests and in the five days leading up to Friday, which marked the end of the first week of classes, the school administered 47,075 tests and had a 0.75% positivity rate. For context, there were roughly 730,000 COVID tests administered in the entire U.S. on a recent August day, according to Johns Hopkins University’s Coronavirus Resource Center. On Aug. 24, U of I administered more than 17,000 tests alone. So far, the number of positive cases is in line with what the school’s modelers predicted — well under 400 cases in the week before classes began. The next couple of weeks will be a “defining moment” for U of I as it works to prevent the spread of COVID-19 on campus and in the community, said Robert Jones, the school’s chancellor. “We know that people are watching,” he told MarketWatch. And indeed, according to Joshua Salomon, the director of the Prevention Policy Modeling Lab at Stanford University, “people are really going to be watching this carefully,” describing the efforts the school has taken as “encouraging.” “We don’t know whether it’s going to succeed,” he added. “What we do know is that the likelihood of succeeding without testing is very small.” At many universities that have reopened their campuses for in-person instruction, students may have been tested upon reentry to university housing or campus more broadly and may be subject to random screening. But models from researchers at Yale School of Public Health and U of I, indicate that in order to prevent an outbreak on a college campus — and not just monitor one — students and those interacting with them regularly need to be tested multiple times per week. U of I may be the only university in the country hewing to that standard. Officials will know around Sept. 25, one month and one day after the start of classes, if their efforts have worked, said Rebecca Lee Smith, an associate professor of pathobiology at U of I who is part of the team that developed the school’s testing and other protocols. “We’re going to be keeping track of how well we’re doing going from test results to isolation to contact tracing and quarantine,” Smith said. They’ll also be looking out for new positive cases, a sign of community spread. The outcome that they’re hoping for “is to minimize the infections, get it under control and to protect the health of campus and the community,” Smith said. The school began working to prepare for the fall semester shortly after classes went remote in the spring, said Martin Burke, a chemistry professor at the University of Illinois and chair of the SHIELD committee, the team that is guiding the university’s approach to reopening. They realized relatively quickly that in order to bring students back to campus, they would need to test frequently and get results back rapidly, something that wasn’t going to be possible with a nasal swab test. That led to what Burke described as a “Manhattan Project-style effort,” at the university  to develop their own test. Ultimately they were able to do so in about six weeks, he said. Now the school is working to expand access to the test to the rest of the state of Illinois and even to other areas of the country and around the world. “Testing is not a silver bullet, but it’s a very powerful component,” Burke said. In addition to the testing, the school developed an app where students, faculty and staff receive test results and reminders, and a boarding pass-style image indicating a negative COVID test that allow them access to campus buildings. Users can also enable the app to notify them when they’ve been in close proximity to someone who tested positive for COVID through the use of an anonymized Bluetooth scanning system. U of I is also taking many of the same steps as other campuses  — moving large lecture courses online, moving smaller in-person courses to large rooms to allow for social distancing and requiring masks. The school also has “every high expectation” of students, Jones said. “By agreeing to come back and be here that they have to take ownership to keep themselves safe.” Those who are participating in on-campus activities and don’t follow testing and isolation guidelines could be subject to student discipline. For a university to have a shot at reopening successfully, it needs to hold classes online or outside when possible, have a good system for testing and contact tracing, and have clear and transparent metrics for when it will change course, Salomon said. (Asked about what would trigger a move to remote instruction, Jones said “one of the key metrics, we’re keeping our eye on is the number of positive cases.”) All of these are costly  and administratively challenging undertakings. Jones said his best “guesstimate” is that the school’s testing component alone will cost $7 to $10 million per semester. But a major obstacle to any successful reopening, is just the status of the spread of the virus itself, Salomon said. “We’re still very much in the middle of a raging pandemic,” he said. “With that amount of transmission in communities and bringing together students from around the country, we know that there will be people infected upon arrival. It raises the bar on what needs to be done to interrupt transmission and cut it off.” During the first week of classes, when the school onboarded tens of thousands of students, “the main hiccup” in its system was turning test results around fast enough so that students, faculty and staff would have access to buildings they needed to be in for class, Smith said. Those who haven’t had a negative test result in the last four days can’t get into university buildings, except their own residence hall. Still, the school has been turning test results around “well within” the 48 hour window they’ve promised, she said. Workman was one of those affected by the hiccup. She got tested on a Monday, which was one of the testing days assigned to her by the school, but didn’t get her results back in time to teach her 8 a.m. Tuesday class in person. She “had to call an audible and tell my class we were meeting on Zoom.” When the two public speaking classes she was teaching started last week, roughly 5% of her students couldn’t attend because they’d tested positive for the virus, Workman said. That’s one metric Workman said she’ll be keeping an eye on as she evaluates whether to keep teaching in person. If enough students can’t attend class face-to-face because of quarantine or isolation, she’ll transition to remote instruction, though her preference is to continue teaching in-person classes — the widespread testing has made her feel comfortable doing so. Owen Stephenson was eager to come to campus for his freshman year to gain some independence, even if he would be taking most of his classes online. So far, he’s felt like the testing has gone smoothly; he received his first two test results on the same day he tested and his only quibble was a 45-minute wait on a weekend, when there are fewer testing tents available. The required testing is part of what makes Stephenson feel like he can keep himself safe, regardless of other students’ behavior. “Their testing is the only thing that sets them apart from other universities trying to go back,” he said of U of I’s plan. From her observations in class, Workman said it seems as if students are committed to making the school’s reopening program work because they want to stick around for the semester. Still, she said, the changes to the college experience required during this time — more rules for engaging on campus, more online courses than typical — have left her students so drained that she ended a recent class 20 minutes early. “They had this feeling that once they were finally able to get back on campus, that life would feel more normal and it’s not.” ‘My concern is that, if something happens to him, I will end up with a lien on my home.’ Jillian Berman covers student debt and millennial finance.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-what-to-know-about-abbotts-15-minute-covid-19-test-11598982464?mod=home-page",
    "text": "On Aug. 26, the Food and Drug Administration granted an Emergency Use Authorization to a new rapid antigen test for COVID-19 called the BinaxNOW test. I study public health policy to combat infectious disease epidemics. Testing is one of the most powerful tools available to fight the spread of COVID-19. The new test is inexpensive, rapid and easy to use. It will massively scale up access to testing, but hurdles remain in achieving widespread, frequent COVID-19 testing. The credit-card-sized test is an antigen test that detects a specific viral protein from SARS-CoV-2. It costs $5 and doesn’t require a lab or a machine for processing. Performing the test is simple. A health-care worker or technician would use a swab to collect a sample from less than 1 inch inside the nostril. They would then combine the sample with a few drops of chemicals inside the test card. Within 15 minutes, the test strip would show a positive or negative result. The test is also paired with an app that produces a digital code that can be scanned to show proof of a recent negative COVID-19 test. The BinaxNOW test is currently only authorized for patients who have had COVID-19 symptoms for seven days or less, which is when virus levels in the body are likely to be high. It must be prescribed by a physician and performed by a trained technicianor other health-care worker. The PCR test for COVID-19 is currently widely used and considered the gold standard, but requires patient samples to be sent to a lab and can take days to provide results. The new antigen test is designed to be a cheap and quick alternative to PCR testing for diagnostic purposes in a medical setting. It would add critical capacity to an overstretched testing system. The emergency use authorization provides preliminary authorization for doctors to prescribe the antigen test while the full FDA approval process is ongoing. The authorization could be revoked if the test is not as accurate or reliable as expected. However, the true accuracy could be lower because the performance testing group was only 102 people and the accuracy hasn’t been validated by the FDA as part of the full approval process. There will inevitably be some false negatives and false positives with the BinaxNOW test since accuracy isn’t 100%, but the FDA will monitor the data to make sure the test meets the reported accuracy. The BinaxNOW test is cheap, rapid, able to be mass-produced and easy to use outside a lab. This makes it a promising candidate for widespread screening. However, the test is currently only authorized for people with COVID-19 symptoms. This is an obstacle because an estimated 40% of all COVID-19 cases are asymptomatic and these people likely don’t know that they’re contagious. To maximize the effectiveness of any COVID-19 screening program, it is important to test people whether they have symptoms or not. Health-care providers are able to prescribe the BinaxNOW test for asymptomatic patients for off-label use, but health officials don’t yet know how accurate the test is when performed on asymptomatic people. The massive expansion of testing access made possible by the BinaxNOW test will almost surely outweigh the downsides of a small number of inaccurate results. Abbott plans to manufacture 50 million tests per month starting in October. This will quickly exceed the 76 million COVID-19 tests the U.S. has performed over the last six months. Widespread, frequent testing is effective at slowing the spread of the coronavirus. The new testing capacity made possible by the authorization of this rapid antigen test represents a major advance in bringing the pandemic under control. Zoë McLaren is an associate professor of public policy at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. This was first published by The Conversation — “Will the new 15-minute COVID-19 test solve US testing problems?“ There is an old Wall Street saying that investing isn’t about being right or wrong, it’s about making money.

Full-year net profit fell 77% to €329 million as a result, while profit from recurring operations fell 13.7%, beating analysts’ expectations as cost control measures took effect. Fourth-quarter sales tumbled 36% to €1.2 billion, as the pandemic hit sales in travel retail as well as bars and restaurants. However, there were signs of improvement in India and China as well as “better than expected resilience” in store and supermarket sales in the U.S. and Europe. Pernod failed to offer any specific guidance but Chief Executive Alexandre Ricard expected “continued uncertainty and volatility,” warning that the virus would impact social gatherings in the months ahead and economic conditions would also be challenging. Ricard said: “We anticipate a prolonged downturn in travel retail but resilience of the off-trade in the USA and Europe and sequential improvement in China, India and the on-trade globally.” Looking ahead. “Given the slightly better earnings delivery and improving trading backdrop in China, Pernod remains our preferred spirits stock pick,” Citi analyst Simon Hales said, while also warning that the sector was at risk of consumers snubbing premium brands in an economic downturn. Hales said there were limited positives for the sector, preferring soft drinks and beer ahead of spirits. Pernod stock rose more than 3% in early trading and is now just 8.5% down year-to-date, as investors welcomed the earnings beat and trading improvement. The reopening of bars and restaurants around the world will certainly help, and the popularity of drinking at home should continue, but the recovery is likely to be gradual rather than V-shaped with much uncertainty ahead.

    "text": "I have been married to my husband for 38 years and we have three children together. When his mother passed away, he received an inheritance of $8,000. My husband never told me about this money, and he spent all of it before I found out he even received his inheritance. When my father passed away, he intended that any inheritance we received would be kept in his own family, so naturally my inheritance was made out to me and me alone. I deposited the money into a checking account with just my name on it. The Moneyist: ‘A man cave on wheels’: My husband’s RV is his pride and joy — but he owes $75,000 on it. If he dies, am I liable? Within 30 days of receiving my inheritance, I purchased a home with the proceeds, and my husband talked me into putting his name on the deed. The check given to the seller’s attorney was a cashier’s check with my name alone. If I die before my husband, is it possible to put the house into a living trust given that my father’s intent was to keep the money within the family, and not my married husband’s family? I want this home to be an inheritance for our children, and I don’t want him to sell it as soon as I die. I wish to make sure that he doesn’t sell it or rent it out in his lifetime. I would like him to live there until he dies. He has paid for a couple of renovations to the home. How would I go about making sure that my kids will have this home as an inheritance, assuming I predecease my husband? A.G. Dear A.G., What’s his is his — and what’s yours belongs to both of you. What happens to your property if you predecease your husband, which is obviously not a given, depends on the kind of ownership you share. If you have “tenancy by entirety” or “joint tenancy with right of survivorship” then your husband will inherit your half of the home. If you have “tenancy in common,” then you will be able to bequest your half to someone else, in this case your kids. If you had bought this property alone with the money you inherited from your father, it’s typically deemed separate property in a community-property state (Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin). Inheritance is usually separate property. But if you use marital funds to improve the property, it becomes community or marital property. The Moneyist: My mother’s will says her boyfriend can live in her home after she dies. Can I still kick him out if the deed is transferred to me? But it’s different in separate-property states in most cases where there are no extenuating circumstances. “In a separate property state, one spouse can hold property without having the other spouse on title, and the other spouse would not have any right to that property,” says Kimberly Hanlon, co-founder of Lucere Legal in Minneapolis. “In the case of a divorce, the court will sometimes look at the proportionate share of contribution when determining how to split up the asset, in which case her contribution in the initial purchase would be weighed against his contribution in the improvements,” she adds. Probate court also considers whether it’s a separate asset, joint asset, and a prenuptial agreement can change it again. The Moneyist:My husband and I are worth $3.7 million, but I’m afraid I’ll spend my way into the poor house if he dies. When I was single, I bounced checks. What can I do? In some separate-property states, the surviving spouse has statutory rights to a certain percentage of their deceased spouse’s estate and/or rights in the marital homestead, Hanlon says. “Minnesota is like that. However, the surviving spouse may consent to waive those rights, either in advance — while their spouse still lives — or after the death.” You don’t say where you live, but your husband seemed to know what he was doing: not putting his name on the deed and using marital funds to renovate the home. The good news is the opposite is also true if he predeceases you. But let’s hope that doesn’t happen and you have many more than your 38 years left. If you do receive another inheritance, don’t let anyone talk you into anything.

    "title": "Only 19% of Tesla analysts say buy the stock while investors remain ‘insatiable’",
    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/only-19-of-tesla-analysts-say-buy-the-stock-while-investors-remain-insatiable-2020-09-01?mod=home-page",
    "text": "There is an old Wall Street saying that investing isn’t about being right or wrong, it’s about making money. No one understands that better than an investor in Tesla Inc.’s stock. The financial fundamentals and the historical valuations of earnings suggest the market is wrong about the electric vehicle (EV) maker’s stock price, according to the overwhelming majority of Tesla analysts. But the stock keeps rising and Tesla investors keep making money. No one is making more money than Elon Musk, Tesla’s chief executive officer, largest shareholder and arguably its most important cheerleader, who just became the third-richest person in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak, who has been bearish on Tesla since Jan. 23 2019, when the stock closed at $57.52, put it this way in a note to clients: Spak raised his price target to $290 from $170, but his target was still 42% below Monday’s closing price. See related: His short position just got ‘obliterated,’ but this Tesla bear isn’t giving up. Also read: Tesla takes advantage of stock’s best month in 7 years with $5 billion offering. There are some fundamental reasons for investors being right to buy, as Tesla has been profitable for four straight quarters, while Wall Street was wrong to expect losses in three of the past four quarters. And despite concerns about the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, Tesla delivered way more EVs than expected during the second quarter. While the 5-for-1 stock split Tesla announced on Aug. 11 didn’t improve the company’s fundamentals in any way, investors were right to buy or hold on to their shares, for now, as the price has charged up more than 80% since the announcement through Monday. Read more: Tesla stock rally accelerates further into record territory after split takes effect. Despite such strong investor conviction, 81% of analysts don’t recommend buying. Of the 36 analysts surveyed by FactSet, only seven, or 19%, have the equivalent of buy ratings on Tesla’s stock. And only one of those analysts, Jefferies’s Philippe Houchois, had a price target — $500 — that was above Monday’s closing price. Meanwhile, half the analysts had the equivalent of hold ratings and 11 analysts, or 31%, had the equivalent of sell ratings. The average price target of all the analysts was $261.85, according to FactSet, which implied a 47% drop from Monday’s closing price. Most of what analysts have been wrong about Tesla has taken place over roughly the past five months. At the end of March, when the COVID-19 crisis was full blown, there were the same number of bearish analysts as there are now and the average stock price target was $101.86, just 2.8% below the March 31 closing price of $104.80. With the stock’s gain since then, Tesla’s market capitalization increased to $464.3 billion as of Monday’s close, which was the seventh highest among U.S. companies. RBC’s Spak suggested that what may also keep supporting the stock is that given the sheer market valuation of Tesla, many portfolio managers have to add to positions “just to keep pace.” He also believes investors have been willing to show more patience and look further into the future to value the stock. “We still view Tesla as fundamentally overvalued and having to grow into its valuation,” Spak wrote. Spak recognizes that Tesla is clearly ahead of its competition, has relatively inexpensive access to capital, the ability to attract talent, an “incredible” brand, and understands that “narrative, momentum and other factors” can impact the stock price. But he still believes that ultimately, a company’s value is related to fundamental factors. Basically, he’s suggesting that one of the biggest risk factors to Tesla’s stock isn’t good or bad fundamental news, but how investors value that news. The next major potential news catalyst is Tesla’s “battery day” scheduled for Sept. 22, of which Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said recently he’s expecting a number of potential “game changing” developments. One of those developments is the “million mile” battery, which in theory will support an EV for 1 million miles, which could put Tesla miles ahead of its traditional gasoline-powered automotive competitors. That said, Ives is one of the analysts that doesn’t recommend buying — he’s at hold — while his price target of $380 suggests the stock could fall 24%. For those looking for actual fundamental risks, the following are just some of those included in the more than 20 pages of “risk factors” Tesla lists in its latest quarterly report filed on July 28. So far, those risks haven't mattered to Tesla investors. • “We are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer.” • “We have been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by the global COVID-19 pandemic, the duration and economic, governmental and social impact of which is difficult to predict, which may significantly harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.” • “We have experienced in the past, and may experience in the future, delays or other complications in the design, manufacture, launch, and production ramp of our vehicles, energy products, and product features, or may not realize our manufacturing cost targets, which could harm our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.” • “Our future growth and success is dependent upon consumers’ willingness to adopt electric vehicles and specifically our vehicles. We operate in the automotive industry, which is generally susceptible to cyclicality and volatility.” • “Any issues or delays in meeting our projected timelines, costs and production at or funding the ramp of Gigafactory Shanghai, or any difficulties in generating and maintaining local demand for vehicles manufactured there, could adversely impact our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition.” • “If our vehicles or other products that we sell or install fail to perform as expected, our ability to develop, market and sell our products and services could be harmed.” • “The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and we may not be successful in competing in these industries. We currently face competition from new and established domestic and international competitors and expect to face competition from others in the future, including competition from companies with new technology.” Shares of DocuSign Inc.  are up more than 16% in Tuesday morning trading after Zoom Video Communications Inc.  reported July-quarter results showing that it made more than four times as much revenue as it did a year ago. Zoom's earnings, which topped expectations, suggested that technologies enabling remote business functions are still seeing explosive growth due to the pandemic. DocuSign, which enables electronic signatures on legal documents, is due to report its own results after Thursday's closing bell. Shares of workplace-messaging company Slack Inc.  is also seeing its stock rise more than 3% in Tuesday's session. Zoom shares are up more than 45% in the session and they'e gained nearly 600% on the year as the S&P 500  has risen 8.6%.

    "title": "Here’s what could trigger more stock market pullbacks this year, says Schwab trading pro",

    "text": "A record-setting August for stocks has set the bar high, but September may be off to an upbeat start, led by technology. That brings us to our call of the day from Schwab Center for Financial Research’s vice president of trading and derivatives, Randy Frederick, who thinks the stock market may finally deliver on some much-needed corrections. “We haven’t had anything of that nature at all since going all the way back to early June, when we had that big drop-off. We’re clearly way overdue on that,” Frederick said. And while 3,700 sounds “pretty remarkable from a bottom-of-the-virus return,” on a year-to-date basis that 14% gain for the S&P 500 is fairly average, he noted. When those smallish pullbacks come along, though, he advises against panic (he urged no panic in early March too), saying “they will be and should be used as buying opportunities.” That is  because there is nowhere else for investors to put their money as any Federal Reserve interest rate increase is years out, said Frederick. And investors should learn from those who panicked out of the market in 2008 and missed out on an 11-year bull market, he added. One potential correction trigger is technical, as he says 2020 has been closely tracking the action in 2009. That year saw three pullbacks — 3.5%, 4.3% and 5.6% in the last few months of 2009 — as his chart shows: A “substantial pullback in earnings could also trigger a pullback,” he said, noting that second-quarter S&P 500 earnings per share came in far better than expected. Frederick is watching the coronavirus pandemic as a potential trigger, with schools opening across the country and the potential for a dramatic uptick in the case count spooking markets, while trade issues with China shouldn’t be dismissed, as they also have the power to unhinge markets. Another stick of dynamite for stocks is continued wrangling over enhanced unemployment benefits in the U.S. “That’s a big issue that needs to be resolved on what they should do to support workers and small business going forward,” said Frederick.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/my-husbands-rv-is-his-pride-and-joy-but-he-owes-75000-on-it-if-he-dies-am-i-liable-for-this-debt-2020-08-31?mod=home-page",
    "text": "My husband and I have been married for almost eight years. Prior to marriage we had a prenuptial agreement made, where his RV and truck remained his to do whatever with, as my home and car remained mine. His RV is his pride and joy, and his “man cave” on wheels. I recently learned that his RV is “upside down.” He owes $75,000 more on it than it’s worth. My concern is that if something happens to him, I will end up with a lien on my home. My name is not on the RV, nor is his name on my home. Your help and thoughts are very much appreciated. Thank you. That was a clear prenuptial agreement. What’s yours is yours and what’s his is his, and anything you earn during your marriage is, I presume, shared. More or less. It sounds like you want to commingle your lives, but not your finances. Boys love their toys and he clearly takes great pride in his man cave on wheels, and it was and is important to him that it’s his, and his alone. That’s good news for you: You are not liable for this debt, if his name alone is on the loan. In community-property states — Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin — debt incurred during a marriage is deemed “community” responsibility. That is, both spouses are liable for that debt. In Alaska, newlyweds can choose to opt into community property rules. In other common-law states, spouses can incur debt on credit cards and RV loans during their marriage, and they are solely responsible for them. The Moneyist: My mother’s will says her boyfriend can live in her home after she dies. Can I still kick him out if the deed is transferred to me? There is one major exception to these rules, according to the American Bankruptcy Institute. You are liable for medical debts of your spouse under a legal theory called the Doctrine of Necessities. “The necessities rule is not limited to medical bills. It could apply to utilities, rent, food, clothing and any other necessities, but the most common lawsuit utilizing this legal concept is in the collection of medical debts,” it says. (At least two states, Virginia and Alabama, challenged this.) “In Nebraska, when you marry someone you also marry their future medical debts. If your spouse incurs medical debts during the marriage, you are liable for the debt. Even if the bills only come in the name of your spouse. Even if you did not sign for the debts. Even if you did not authorize the treatment. Even if you are separated. In Nebraska, when you marry someone you also marry their future medical debts. This doctrine has been accepted in Nebraska courts,” the institute adds. The Moneyist:My husband and I are worth $3.7 million, but I’m afraid I’ll spend my way into the poor house if he dies. When I was single, I bounced checks. What can I do? This does not, however, account for the indirect costs of a spouse incurring debts. You started your marriage with your eyes open, so you should continue in that spirit. Organize a monthly budget so you know where your red lines are on spending, and how much you need to earn to keep the books balanced, and put money aside for an emergency fund. You may also want to see if your husband can cut back on his spending to pay off his RV debt sooner rather than later. You’re a team. Worst-case scenario: If your husband cannot pay off the debt owed on his RV, it would obviously be repossessed by the company. If you or he lost his job, on the other hand, presumably the other spouse would shoulder the burden and help the other out. If he asks you to help out with the payments on his RV? That’s another question entirely. Hopefully, that won’t happen, Mary Ellen, and you and your husband will have a long and happy life together, and a few memorable trips in his RV.

    "text": "U.S. Treasury yields inch higher on early Wednesday’s trade as traders look past a private-sector employment report showing less job gains than forecast. Automatic Data Processing Inc. said 428,000 private-sector jobs were added in August, up from the previous 167,000, but falling short of the 1 million consensus forecast. The ADP report offered signs that further job gains were slowing down, amid concerns the recovery’s momentum was petering out. Analysts, however, have noted the wide divergence between weak private-sector payrolls and a more robust official jobs numbers in the last three months. Investors are expected to shrug off the data and focus on the official employment report at the end of the week. In other data, U.S. factory orders are due at 10 a.m. Eastern. Later, the Federal Reserve will release its latest Beige Book at 2 p.m., a collection of anecdotes from businesses across the country. Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin added to the chorus of voices from the central bank defending the Fed’s decision to implement an average inflation targeting regime, but didn’t offer many details on how it was likely to be carried out. “Initial estimates of private sector employment change have had glaring downside misses over the prior few months,” said John Herrmann, a rates strategist at MUFG Americas, in a note. On the heels of a huge month for stocks in August, our call of the day says investors need to get ready for at least two pullbacks this year, with history as a guide.

Wall Street is also awaiting the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book report, which will be released at 2 p.m. EDT. “Solid economic data out of the United States and China are giving investors hope that the global economy might recover faster than expected from the Covid-19 crisis. This is an important signal for markets, which have already priced in a lot of positive news,” Milan Cutkovic, market analyst at AxiCorp, told clients in a note. Europe’s common currency eased after Philip Lane, chief economist at the European Central Bank, reportedly voiced concern over the euro-dollar rate. “If there are forces moving the euro-dollar rate around, that feeds into our global and European forecasts and that in turn does feed into our monetary policy setting,” Lane said in an online conference on Tuesday evening. The comments weren’t too surprising and the ECB will probably stick to verbal intervention instead of cutting rates, Gizem Kara, economist at BNP Paribas in London, told clients in a note. The economist said “risk-reward of cutting is not favorable right now” and if the market perceives the ECB has used up its firepower, the currency could even rise. The latest survey from Nationwide Building Society showed U.K. house prices rose by a seasonally adjusted 2% in August, the highest monthly rise since February 2004. Asian markets finished mixed, with gains led by a 1.8% rise for Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 and gains across most sectors. Data showed the country plunged into recession for the first time in 29 years.

    "text": "Don’t lock them out: lock them in until you have a deal. Shutting out private equity bidders was a favored tactic during the heady days of the debt-fueled buyout boom in 2003. So it’s a strange one to resort to when times are tough and private capital should be welcome. The troubled provider of insurance and cruises to the over-50s rejected a recent 33 pence-a-share takeover offer from a consortium of two unnamed U.S. private equity groups, which it said was“unsolicited and highly conditional.” Instead, Saga has chosen to tap its shareholders – which includes dozens of retail investors – for £150 million ($201 million) in an equity raise to cope with its spiralling debts. As part of the plan, Sir Roger De Haan, the son of Saga’s founder Sidney, will return to the company’s board as chairman, replacing incumbent Patrick O’Sullivan. Saga prides itself on looking after its loyal customer base. However, many of those loyal customers are retail shareholders who ironically, as a result of Saga’s proposal, will be diluted by more than 40% compared with the 140% premium they would have been received from the spurned private equity bidders’ offer. Saga’s convoluted proposal has De Haan, who sold Saga for £1.35 billion in 2004,  investing £75.5 million to buy 324 million shares, or an average entry price of 23 pence a share, to give him a 17% stake. In addition, by underwriting a third of the £75 million placing he could invest a further £25 million at 15 pence, lowering his average entry price to 20 pence and increasing his stake to 25%. That could be enough to block any future bids for the company, which may be in need of further investment in the future. The cruise industry – among those hit hardest by the pandemic – doesn’t look like it will recover anytime soon. Private equity has abundant supplies of dry powder to inject into troubled companies. The same can’t be said for shareholders who will be expected to stump up more cash in coming months as many companies look to raise equity to cope with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on their operations, which has left many of them reliant on borrowing to meet expenses. On Tuesday, AA granted its potential bidders –  which include a joint offer from Centerbridge Partners Europe and TowerBrook Capital, as well as separate cash bids from Platinum Equity Advisors and Warburg Pincus International –  an extra four weeks to make an offer for the company. Now is the right time for Saga to learn from its ex-sibling. With much of the market recovering from its March lows, it is no wonder that investors are looking for opportunities in beaten-up sectors. And bank stocks certainly fit the bill. Lina Saigol is the London-based head of corporate news in the Europe, Middle East and Africa regions for MarketWatch and Barron’s Group.

    "text": "The thought must’ve crossed many investors’ minds during the pandemic. Why not just get out of the markets entirely and switch into cash? Fund management giant Vanguard Group looked at the investors who did exactly that, in a study recently published. Now, the Vanguard crowd isn’t exactly that of Robinhood—between Feb. 19 and May 31, only 5% of self-directed defined-contribution plan participants traded at all. The proportion was somewhat higher among retail self-directed households, with 17% making some trades during that time period. For both sets of investors, less than 0.5% of clients moved into all-cash portfolio, Vanguard said. The defined contribution cash panickers went from having 69% of their $105,000 portfolios in stocks at the end of 2019, and the retail cash panickers went from having 77% of their $70,000 portfolios in stocks. In both cases, these investors were typically in the mid-50s and held accounts for over a decade. About two-thirds of the defined contribution cash panickers were female; the retail cash panicker split was 46% male, 29% female and 25% a household of two or more members. Vanguard then went and compared the distributions of their actual realized returns to their personal pre-pandemic benchmark returns. At the end of March, the cash panickers had done better, with 56% of defined contribution and 58% of individual investors sporting better returns. That changed as the market rebounded. By the end of May, 84% of the defined contribution cash panickers had worse returns than their pre-pandemic portfolio, with 86% of retail cash panickers doing worse. This has been the best month since the April bounce-back, as tech stocks have extended gains.

    "text": "If you are an investor of any type — whether you have a 401(k), IRA, or trading account — there are a few things you could do to promote racial equity. You may have heard of ESG investing, which stands for “environmental, social and governance.” It is also often called sustainable, socially responsible or simply “values” investing. It’s an investment strategy that selects stocks and bonds based not only on traditional financial criteria, but also based on the impact of different companies on society and the environment. Proponents of ESG investing point to a growing body of evidence that suggests sustainable investing may actually improve a portfolio’s performance, while also serving the greater good. Over the past five years, sustainable funds have outperformed their conventional peers in both up and down markets, according to a Morningstar report. Also, as markets tumbled during the first quarter of 2020, almost 60% of the biggest U.S. sustainable mutual funds and exchange-traded funds lost less in market value than the S&P 500. The popularity of socially responsible investing has exploded in recent years. In early 2020, around 74% of global investors said they plan to increase their ESG allocation over the next year. In the first quarter of 2020, U.S., sustainable funds saw inflows of $10.5 billion, according to Morningstar — a more than 10-fold increase from the first quarter of 2010. And even as markets tumbled due to the coronavirus crisis, global demand for ESG proved resilient. The global sustainable-fund universe saw inflows of over $45 billion in the first quarter, while the overall fund universe saw outflows of more than $380 billion, according to Morningstar. Environmental factors often include things like carbon emissions and water usage. Social impact may involve working conditions for a company’s employees and gender or racial equity. And governance criteria often have to do with board oversight and transparency. In light of recent events, the “S” — or social — part of ESG has come into focus, as more and more people are looking at the social impact of large corporations, specifically from a racial justice standpoint. That’s where things get a little tricky. There are more than 300 funds marketed as ESG in the U.S., according to Morningstar. But there’s no official definition of “socially responsible” investing. To further complicate the issue, there are dozens of different companies that issue ESG ratings, ranging from large data providers, like MSCI and Sustainalytics, to smaller companies and even nonprofits that focus on topics like gender-pay equity and civil liberties. Unlike accounting standards, there is not one unique methodology. Some of the data is self-reported by the companies, and some of it is done by third parties, who are often estimating. There are of course some broad principles, like how the company treats its workers — but these are often hard to quantify. For example, companies can get a high score for having anti-harassment policies in place, without tracking how well the policies are actually implemented. “There are not yet clear apple-to-apple comparisons across the board even for public companies, let alone private companies,” said Andrei Cherny, CEO of Aspiration, an online “financial firm with a conscience,” which offers a variety of banking and investing products focused on environmental and social impact. Cherny has called for regulators to require public companies to report ESG-related data, such as carbon emissions, diversity of their workforce, and how they pay their employees — just like they have legal obligations to report their financial performance. “Those are factors that investors need to know just as much as they need to know the price-to-earnings ratio,” he said. Other industry leaders echo Cherny’s thoughts. For instance, in the wake of recent events, Calvert Research & Management, a prominent sustainable-investing shop, called for companies to “accurately assess their racial diversity” and make it public, provide pay equity disclosure across race and gender, and publicly state what they are doing to combat racism and police brutality. Meanwhile, some asset managers have decided to influence change from the inside. Neuberger Berman, which manages $330 billion, decided to use its shareholder status to drive governance and sustainability practices. In April 2020, the company announced that it would publicly disclose and explain the firm’s voting rationale and intentions at more than 25 key annual shareholder meetings. “Normally shareholders vote quietly behind the scenes,” said Jonathan Bailey, Head of ESG at Neuberger Berman. Instead, by providing advance vote disclosure, Neuberger Berman intends to educate investors and the public on “why we’re voting a particular way,” Bailey said. “We have a responsibility, as market participants, to take [these issues] seriously; they’re financially material issues,” Bailey said. The proposal did not end up passing, as it gathered about 30% shareholder support, according to a Neuberger Berman spokesperson. While there are currently no industry-wide standards around social impact, a few companies have launched niche products specifically targeted at race and equality. For example, OpenInvest, a company that builds indexes and other investing tools around social causes, has created an index specifically on racial justice. It screens for metrics like board member inclusion, workforce diversity and which companies pollute the most in communities of color. Similarly, Impact Shares, a nonprofit provider of exchange-traded funds, partnered with the NAACP to launch a first-of-its-kind racial empowerment ETF. But what the ESG industry has been missing is that “your social priorities may be drastically different from my social priorities,” said Ethan Powell, CEO of Impact Shares. For example, some ESG funds hold shares of liquor or gaming companies. These holdings might be a problem for some investors, but not others. Powell envisions a future where “effectively every social issue will be reflected with a separately investible fund,” so that investors can create portfolios that are reflective of their individual social priorities. Partnering with nonprofits could play a key role in the development of such products, according to Powell, because social-advocacy organizations are in a better position to understand the particular social issues at hand. What many experts agree on is that growing investor demand will inevitably push the industry to innovate. Years ago socially-responsible investing offered just a few options to cover a small piece of investors’ stock portfolios. Today, there are hundreds of different mutual and exchange-traded funds to pick from, not just in equities but also in fixed income and even junk bonds. One study showed that around $12 trillion of assets in the U.S. are managed under some sustainable investing strategy. So while you wait for the industry to establish widely-accepted standards, you could start building your own socially-responsible portfolio by looking at the ratings and methodology of different funds and companies and picking what aligns best with your values and financial goals.

    "text": "Sophisticated algorithms are being used by one of Europe’s biggest movie theater chains to help with social distancing. Vue International, which has around 230 cinemas in the U.K., Germany, Taiwan, Italy, Poland and other European countries, has been using artificial intelligence to optimize screening times and is making adjustments to control the flow of audiences into auditoriums. Tim Richards, who founded privately owned Vue cinemas around 20 years ago, said 10 years’ worth of data had been fed in computers pre-COVID to decide on the timing and frequency for screening movies. This has now been adapted to control the flow of customers into the cinemas by staggering screening times. It is being linked with seating software that cocoons customers within their family bubbles, or on their own, a safe distance away from other customers. Richards, speaking at a press briefing on Monday evening, said: “It took me 17 years to build the group up to 230 cinemas. What happened just a few months ago was apocalyptic. “We have planned for crises such as a cinema being shut and blockbusters tanking, but not all the cinemas being down. Our big [cost] exposures are studios, people, and rent — we were quickly focused on our burn rate and liquidity.” Last month it was reported that Vue was lining up £100 million ($133 million) in additional debt financing. The firm is owned by Alberta Investment Management Corporation and pension fund Omers. Richards and other managers hold a 27% stake. Vue has been slowly reopening its cinemas around Europe over the past few weeks. “We have been using AI to help determine what is played, at what screen, and at which cinemas [to optimize revenues],” he said. “Our operating systems have been tweaked to social distance customers. It recognizes if you are with family and it will cocoon you. At the moment we are probably able to use 50% of cinemas’ capacities. “We can control the number of people in the foyer at any one time. Crowds would not be conducive to helping customers feel comfortable coming back. Every member of staff went through two days of safety training.” Richards said when he did reopen his movie theaters there was pent-up demand from customers but no new movies to screen. “We still managed at 50% run rate with classic movies that were not only already available on streaming services but on terrestrial television as well. People just wanted to get out of their homes and have some kind of normalcy.” Christopher Nolan’s complex thriller “Tenet” is the first major new film to be released and Richards said: “We are seeing ‘Tenet’ performing at the same levels as ‘Inception’ and ‘Interstellar’ did which has been amazing. “It will be a bumpy road in some areas but we expect a return to normalcy in six months — it will take a couple of months to get people comfortable again with their positions.” “Netflix has been disruptive for everything in the home,” he said. “We are out of the home, so Netflix is complementary to us because most people who like film like film on all formats. “I’ve seen the demise of the industry predicted definitely five or six times. We have been counter cyclical during downturns — we are reasonably priced so people come out and enjoy what we have to offer.” Rupert Steiner is Barron's Group bureau chief for the Europe, Middle East and Africa region.

    "text": "It’s been no secret that China was among the first to emerge from the pandemic that is still ravaging much of the world — in part because it was the first to experience the crisis, but also because of its heavy-handed but effective lockdown. And compared with much of the world, China’s current conditions are exceptional, and it has been seen as the sort of sentinel in how to return, and how to gauge that return, to elements of normalcy. Schools are mostly back in session, the coronavirus is under control save for a few small pockets, and a steady stream of solid economic news has come in lately. China is likely to be the only country globally to see full-year 2020 economic growth. That being said, China’s National Bureau of Statistics reported on Monday that the manufacturing index fell, while the services reading rose a bit. The country has come an enormous way since January, when it locked down. Yet these measurements of normalcy are misleadingly narrow — they define “normal” in terms of select economic areas, low coronavirus numbers, and kids returning to school — all important metrics. But as China exerts its newfound superpower status, it finds itself grappling with the most challenges faced in years if not decades. Defined this way, things are far from normal. “In these days of the global pandemic, ‘normal’ is relative,” Karen Eggleston, director of Stanford University’s Asia health-policy program, told MarketWatch on Wednesday. Eggleston added: “China still faces numerous challenges, from handling the risks of reinfection, to making up for the foregone/delayed screening and care for non-COVID conditions, to quickly but carefully developing and testing vaccines and preparing for national deployment in an industry previously rocked by scandal, to trying to address the structural challenges underlying [the difficulty and expense of receiving medical care], and addressing disparities in lifecourse opportunities for healthy lives that leads to a more than 10-year differences in life expectancy across regions.” Thus, under the placid surface of China’s post-coronavirus return to life largely as it was, lies a slew of exceptions, setbacks and maneuverings that are both part of its escape from the pathogen’s grip as well as its ongoing rise as the world’s up-and-coming global power. China’s true unemployment rate may never be known given China’s opaque system — the latest reading by outside experts puts the number at 20% among recent graduates — the concentration-camp scandal and virus crisis in the Xinjiang region are roiling potentially millions of lives, border clashes with India and historically bad relations with the U.S. (aggravated by the pandemic) put it at loggerheads with two giant rivals, Beijing’s takeover of Hong Kong has upended many lives there, and the worst floods in decades are wreaking havoc across a quarter of the country. Last weekend, China implemented restrictive export rules for technology companies, which could complicate an order from the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump’s that ByteDance sell the American operations of its subsidiary TikTok by Sept. 15. The move mirrors the economic retaliations the countries have been lobbing since the trade war. Most observers are focused on the brighter day-to-day return to normal life. “From afar it looks a miserable year for all the reasons you cited, but relatively China appears to be doing better than many other countries that are still struggling with the pandemic,” said China expert  Bill Bishop, author of the Sinocism newsletter and a former MarketWatch executive. Susan Shirk, currently a professor at the School of Global Policy and Strategy at the University of California, San Diego, who previously served as deputy assistant secretary of state responsible for U.S. policy toward China, agreed, telling MarketWatch, “I believe that what people mean when they contrast China’s ‘return to normalcy’ to the situation in the U.S. and many other countries, is simply that people have returned to in-person work, school, shopping, dining, and even travel now that the virus has been controlled for the time being.  But of course, you are right that there are many features of pre-covid life that haven’t returned yet and the government is on high alert for any new outbreaks.” COVID didn’t cause all of China geopolitical and trade issues, its frayed relationships with more than a handful of countries. But it certainly exacerbated them. We might do well to rethink our definition of “return to normalcy.” Tanner Brown covers China for  MarketWatch and Barron’s. U.S. Sen.

    "text": "As Americans have been forced to stay at home for work, school and even visits to the doctor, shares of cloud-services providers have soared. But there’s something else going on that points to a long-term trend investors need to know about: a housing shortage outside cities, and a boom in  home renovation and improvement. But variety is the spice of life — and an excellent tool to cut risk in your investment portfolio and avoid missing out on opportunities. Of course, an excellent way to play the home construction/renovation trend is through exchange traded funds that focus on appropriate industries. So we looked to three U.S. construction and home improvement-related ETFs, combined their holdings and removed their duplicates for a list of stocks. Taking the three ETFs together and eliminating duplicate holdings, we are left with a group of 69 stocks, 42 of which have had double-digit returns this year. So here’s the entire list, sorted by how well the stocks have performed this year.

As always, if you are considering direct investments in any of the stocks listed here, you need to do your own homework to form an opinion of how well you expect the company to perform over the next several years. You can see that many of the best performers have gotten well ahead of the consensus price targets. Then again, there are 25 with majority “buy” ratings, and many are still expected by analysts to should double-digit gains over the next 12 months. A big NIO bear is a little less bearish. And his upgrade is enough to get NIO shares moving again on Tuesday. Philip van Doorn covers various investment and industry topics.

    "text": "Lego, the world’s biggest toy company, shrugged off coronavirus related store closures to sell more of its distinctive bricks online boosting half year sales and operating profit. The privately owned Danish firm is a pandemic winner as families, stuck at home due the lockdown, played more games and bought more of its products. Lego Group reported that operating profit was up a strong 11% to 3.9 billion Danish Krone ($621 million), with the company gaining more market share globally and succeeding off the back of investments into e-commerce. The back story. Since being founded in 1932, Lego, which is still based in the small Danish town of Billund, has grown to be one of the most recognized toy brands in the world. Privately held, Lego’s brand is based on its distinctive small building blocks, which take center stage in its toys as well as movies and videogame franchises. What’s new. Its profitable, direct-to-consumer business saw sales surge 14% over last year as the company sold directly to families stuck at home. Visitors to its e-commerce platform doubled to more than 100 million compared with last year. These sales drove the strong operating profit even as it was dragged down by costs associated with shipping products following factory closures in China and Mexico. Lego also said its “Let’s Build Together” initiative, which brings learning through play to children stuck at home, had reached over 80 million unique users. Also: This 7-Year-Old Has Loved Finances Since Age 3. Here’s How His Parents Taught Him About Money. Looking ahead. Lego plans to open 120 new retail stores in 2020, 80 of which will be in China at a time when others are scaling back. It has built growth through these testing times by having foresight to invest in e-commerce and confidence to innovate during the pandemic. It used the first half of 2020 to launch products that mix digital and physical play and is well set to remain resilient so it will be in a good position when stores fully reopen around the world.

    "text": "Investors beware: The number of people applying for unemployment benefits could fall sharply when the government reports  jobless claims on Thursday, but it won’t necessarily mean far fewer people are losing their jobs. The Bureau of Labor Statistics said last week it will change its method for adjusting initial jobless claims to account for seasonal swings in employment. That’s a big deal. As a result, new claims could show a large decline of potentially 200,000 or more in the week ended Aug. 29. The BLS will report the numbers at 8:30 a.m. Eastern. The agency’s traditional season-adjustment process worked fine when the U.S. experienced regular ups and downs in employment around the holidays or the end of the school year. Tens of thousands of people, for example, are hired before Christmas and left go after the New Year. The claims numbers are adjusted to smooth out these normal swings in employment. Yet the old approach to seasonal adjustments has been thrown out of whack by a once-in-a-century pandemic. The seasonally adjusted numbers have constantly exceeded the actual number of people applying for benefits, with the gap becoming especially large in the past month. Consider the most recent week. The government said new jobless claims in the week ended Aug. 22 rose by 1 million after seasonal adjustments. Yet actual or unadjusted claims increased by a smaller 821,591. That’s an 18% difference. The new method of adjustment, based on an additive instead of a multiplicative approach, is complicated to explain. Suffice to say it should result in a much narrower gap between the actual and  seasonally adjusted number of new jobless claims. If so, new claims in the most recent week could fall to 800,000 or below. (If the number actually rises, it would be a bad sign). If it’s not confusing enough, the government won’t revise prior figures for jobless claims under the old method of seasonal adjustments. Not that it matters all that much. Jobless claims soared to record peaks after the coronavirus struck and they are still extremely high by historical standards, even as they continue to decline. New claims ran in the low 200,000s each week and sat near a 50-year low before the crisis. U.S. Sen. Edward Markey defeated U.S. Rep. Joe Kennedy III in Tuesday’s Democratic primary, harnessing support from progressive leaders to overcome a challenge from a younger rival who is a member of America’s most famous political family.

    "text": "More than 100 economists, including at least seven Nobel winners, have signed an open letter urging the Senate to reject Federal Reserve nominee Judy Shelton, calling her views “extreme and ill-considered.” Shelton was nominated for the Fed’s seven-member board of governors by President Donald Trump earlier this year, and the Senate Banking Committee gave her the green light on a party-line vote in July. The full Senate is expected to take up her nomination soon. Shelton was an adviser to Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and has criticized the Fed over its interest-rate policy and influence over the U.S. economy. Critics claim she’s too partisan and would endanger the Fed’s independence. In their letter, the economists said the Fed needs to preserve its “nonpartisan approach,” and questioned Shelton’s qualifications. “Ms. Shelton has a decades-long record of writings and statements that call into question her fitness for a spot on the Fed’s board of governors,” they wrote. “She has advocated for a return to the gold standard; she has questioned the need for federal deposit insurance; she has even questioned the need for a central bank at all. Now, she appears to have jettisoned all of these positions to argue for subordination of the Fed’s policies to the White House — at least as long as the White House is occupied by a president who agrees with her political views.” In her nomination hearing in February, Shelton backed away from some of her previous writings, but Democrats charged she has not changed her views and would have worsened the economic impact of the pandemic if she had been sitting on the Fed board at the time. The letter’s signatories include seven winners of the Nobel Prize for economics: Robert E. Lucas and Lars Peter Hansen of the University of Chicago, Christopher Sims from Princeton University, Eric Maskin and Oliver Hart of Harvard University, Peter Diamond of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Joseph Stiglitz of Columbia University. A separate, nearly word-for-word letter was signed by 70 former Federal Reserve officials and staffers, urging senators to reject Shelton’s nomination. U.S. Sen. Edward Markey defeated U.S. Rep.

    "text": "The chief executive of one of the world’s biggest advertising groups has been forced to apologize after misspeaking during a financial update and sparking a row over ageism. He was asked if the business, home to leading agencies including Ogilvy, Wunderman Thompson, Finsbury, Kantar Group and Grey, had the correct balance of people with skills in digital compared with more traditional television. He had replied: “We have a very broad range of skills, and if you look at our people — the average age of someone who works at WPP is less than 30. They don’t hark back to the 1980s, luckily.” This has triggered an industry row over how experience is valued across businesses, with former employees and commentators questioning whether there is a place for creatives and account managers over the age of 30. Gabriel Dorosz, executive strategy director at The New York Times, tweeted: “I assure you, no one who has worked at WPP, and there are many of us, are shocked or even remotely surprised by Mark Read’s comments.” The company is no stranger to controversy. In 2018, Sir Martin Sorrell, who founded and led WPP for three decades, stepped down amid allegations he used company funds to pay for prostitutes. Sorrell has since denied allegations he visited a prostitute, and paid with WPP’s money. A spokesman has previously said: ” Sir Martin left WPP as a good leaver and I am surprised there [are] any remaining questions of his expenses.” Wall Street has another explanation for why the stock market has been on fire, which could also help investors understand some tech stocks’ red hot winning streaks lately.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/trump-suggests-north-carolina-residents-vote-twice-which-is-illegal-2020-09-02?mod=home-page",
    "text": "President Donald Trump on Wednesday suggested North Carolina residents should try to vote twice — by mail and in person — in the November election, seemingly encouraging them to attempt to commit voter fraud in an effort to test the state’s mail-in voting system. Trump made the comments during an interview with WECT News of Wilmington, N.C., when a reporter asked if he’s confident in the state’s voting system, which could see 600,000 absentee votes cast this fall. “They will vote and then they are going to have to check their vote by going to the poll and voting that way because if it tabulates, then they won’t be able to do that,” Trump said. “So let them send it in, and let them go vote. And if their system is as good as they say it is, then obviously they won’t be able to vote. If it isn’t tabulated, they will be able to vote. So that’s the way it is, and that’s what they should do.” Voting twice is illegal under both North Carolina and federal law. In North Carolina, it is also illegal “to induce” someone else to fraudulently cast a ballot. Trump has been a frequent and vocal critic of mail-in voting, claiming — without evidence — that it is susceptible to fraud. Trump himself has voted by mail a number of times. WECT said the way North Carolina’s system is set up, it is “clerically impossible for a person to vote twice,” because once the mail-in ballot is received, the voter would not be allowed to cast a vote in person. When asked about Trump’s suggestion Wednesday night on CNN, U.S. Attorney General William Barr said Trump was “trying to make a point,” but declined to say whether voting twice is illegal (it unequivocally is), telling host Wolf Blitzer “I don’t know what the law in the particular state says.” Separately, federal prosecutors in North Carolina charged 19 non-citizens with voter fraud Wednesday, accusing them of illegally casting ballots in 2016. Few details were disclosed, but one defendant’s attorney told the Associated Press: “These cases are clearly timed for partisan political purposes.” Rudy Giuliani offers his perspective to Fox News on rising concerns that the police disproportionately kill black Americans.

    "text": "Health experts are learning that recovering from the coronavirus takes time. In fact, a new study of roughly 4,500 Italian COVID-19 patients published on Wednesday evening found that it takes 30 days on average for SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes the COVID-19 infection, to leave the body after the first positive test result. It takes 36 days on average for the virus to clear the body after a person starts showing symptoms. And it can linger even longer in older patients and in those with more severe illness, according to the peer-reviewed manuscript published in the online journal BMJ Open. While it’s not clear from just this observational report whether someone is still infectious during this 30-or-so-day window, the authors recommend that patients testing positive for COVID-19 get tested again in four or more weeks after their symptoms first appear in order to minimize the risk of spreading the virus. Indeed, the long-term effects of COVID-19 are only just beginning to come to light, roughly half a year into the pandemic. Some “long hauler” coronavirus patients have continued to suffer symptoms and coronavirus-related health issues for months after their initial infections, including shortness of breath, extreme muscle weakness and fatigue, and brain fog. The CDC has warned that one in five previously healthy young adults weren’t back to their usual health 14 to 21 days after testing positive. And another study found more than half (55%) of coronavirus patients still had neurological problems three months later. What’s more, this new BMJ Open report also found that the rate of false negative test results appeared to be high early in the coronavirus patients’ recovery. The study subjects were tested 15 days after their first positive swabs, 14 days after their second swabs, and nine days after their third. Those who tested negative were tested again — and the negative results were only confirmed in 79% of those cases, suggesting a rate of one false negative out of every five negative test results. The authors fear that the high rate of false negatives, plus the evidence that the virus remains in the body for more than a month, puts COVID-19 patients at risk of “unwittingly passing on the infection” as they return to work or school believing that they are all better. But the current guidance from the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that most COVID-19 patients are indeed in the clear after isolating themselves for 10 to 13 days. And those with mild to moderate illness, whose symptoms have resolved, can then leave quarantine without even getting tested for COVID-19 again. The CDC did not immediately respond to a MarketWatch request for comment about whether it has considered extending the length of time that COVID-19 patients should isolate themselves, or whether testing guidelines should be adjusted. The WHO notes that while some research has suggested that patients whose symptoms have resolved may indeed still test positive for COVID-19 for many weeks afterward, “these patients are not likely to be infectious and therefore are unlikely to be able to transmit the virus to another person.” That’s because the amount of virus a person is carrying, or their viral load, may be too low for that person to be contagious. In fact, a recent New York Times analysis suggests that many people getting diagnosed with COVID-19 could be carrying “relatively insignificant amounts” of the virus, which means that they are probably not contagious. This is because the most widely used diagnostic COVID-19 tests are PCR tests that detect the presence of the virus’ genetic material in the body. And these sensitive diagnostics can flag not only live virus samples in the body, but also genetic fragments left over from an earlier infection. (These traces are kind of like how strands of a person’s hair or skin cells can be found in a room after the person is long gone.) That’s not to say these standard diagnostic tests should be thrown out the window for being too sensitive, however. The Food and Drug Administration told the Times that when people are first infected with COVID-19, for example, they may also carry a low viral load. And tests that are less sensitive could miss these cases. The CDC also notes that someone could test negative for COVID-19 early in their infection. Research suggests that the most contagious window for COVID-19 tends to be between one to three days before someone shows symptoms (with the highest viral loads on the day someone becomes symptomatic), up until about five days afterward, according to the World Health Organization. And this level of contagiousness appears to be one to two weeks for asymptomatic persons, and up to three weeks or more for patients with mild to moderate disease. The bottom line: This is still a new virus, and health experts are still learning about how it spreads. People may be carrying the virus in their bodies longer than researchers first suspected, but it’s unclear exactly how long they will be contagious. A new study published in JAMA Pediatrics suggests that children, including asymptomatic ones, may shed the virus for weeks. So what should people take from the latest research? They should keep practicing key social-distancing measures, monitoring for symptoms, and they should get tested if they start showing symptoms or suspect that they have been exposed. Even those who test negative — either because they haven’t been exposed to the virus, or because they have recovered from it — should continue taking steps to protect themselves and those around them. This includes: washing their hands often; avoiding close contact with people outside of their household by staying at least six feet apart; and covering their nose and mouth with a face mask around others, even if they don’t feel sick. There were 25.8 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide as of Wednesday afternoon, according to the Johns Hopkins data, and at least 857,877 people have died. More than 17 million people are confirmed to have tested positive and recovered. Follow more of MarketWatch’s coronavirus coverage here. The asset managers added to bets on a cyclical recovery.

    "text": "Fund provider GraniteShares rolled out its 3X Short Tesla Daily Exchange-Traded Product, which was a part of a basket of single-stock ETPs that were intended to whet investors appetite for bullish and bearish risk taking on Wall Street, as large-capitalization technology-related stocks helped to power an historic rebound for the broader market from its coronavirus pandemic lows. The Tesla short, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange, jumped 40.5% on Wednesday afternoon. It is listed in London  because U.S. regulatory rules frowned at the notion of a leverage single-stock ETP products,  William Rhind CEO and founder of Granite Shares told MarketWatch in a Tuesday interview.  “It’s complicated.” On Tuesday, the short-Tesla ETP saw 2.8 million shares trade hands in a flurry of activity as the stock sank 4.7%. On Wednesday, about 700,000 Tesla shares changed hands, as the underlying stock sold off by at least 10% at the peak, with that drop for the Elon Musk-run company meeting the commonly used criteria for an asset-price correction. To be sure, the triple-leveraged ETF has also experienced withering losses to this point, and is down 80.5% in the past 30-day period, according to FactSet data. Tesla’s stock, which recently completed a 5-for-1 stock split, consummated on Monday, has been one of the hardest charging stocks of the pandemic era. Tesla’s shares are up 430% so far this year as investors perceive the stock as a bet on the future of the growing electric-vehicle industry or as an investment that may be more resilient to the turbulence in the market inspired partly by the COVID-19 pandemic. Bearish investors, however, like ones who might buy the triple-leverage, vehicle to short, or bet on falls in value of Tesla’s shares, have pointed out that there is little justification for the precipitous rise of the company which offers no dividend and which has a price-to-earnings ratio–a common measure of a stock’s value–of 1,153, according to FactSet data. GraniteShares also offers a Graniteshares 3X Long Tesla Daily ETP that also trades on the LSE. It was down 22% on Wednesday but has enjoyed a nearly 200% increase over the past 30-day period. GraniteShares says it offered the risky bets on the market because it provides investors a low-cost chance to take a position in those companies. For example, the triple-leverage short ETP finished Wednesday trade at 19 cents and a share of the triple-long ETF is $38.50. To be certain, GraniteShares isn’t the only fund provider touting leveraged, single-stock ETPs but the leverage on its products might be the most extreme in terms of Tesla. Fund provider Leverage Shares offers 1x and 2x leveraged Tesla ETP. Those funds launched in June.   “Given the heightened interest in short & leveraged offerings in the current volatile environment, we offer these leveraged and inverse ETPs as a safer alternative to trading contract for differences (CFDs) or buying on margin,”  Raj Sheth, director solutions at Leverage Shares, was quoted as saying by ETF Stream. It’s important to note that ETPs aren’t like plain vanilla exchange-traded funds, which attempt to mimic an index. Complex, leveraged ETPs like those for GraniteShares and Leverage Shares represent only a sliver of the multi-trillion dollar ETP market but they also have inherent risks of losing a lot of money.

Vue International, which has around 230 cinemas in the U.K., Germany, Taiwan, Italy, Poland and other European countries, has been using artificial intelligence to optimize screening times and is making adjustments to control the flow of audiences into auditoriums. Tim Richards, who founded privately owned Vue cinemas around 20 years ago, said 10 years’ worth of data had been fed in computers pre-COVID to decide on the timing and frequency for screening movies. This has now been adapted to control the flow of customers into the cinemas by staggering screening times. It is being linked with seating software that cocoons customers within their family bubbles, or on their own, a safe distance away from other customers. Richards, speaking at a press briefing on Monday evening, said: “It took me 17 years to build the group up to 230 cinemas. What happened just a few months ago was apocalyptic. “We have planned for crises such as a cinema being shut and blockbusters tanking, but not all the cinemas being down. Our big [cost] exposures are studios, people, and rent — we were quickly focused on our burn rate and liquidity.” Last month it was reported that Vue was lining up £100 million ($133 million) in additional debt financing. The firm is owned by Alberta Investment Management Corporation and pension fund Omers. Richards and other managers hold a 27% stake. Vue has been slowly reopening its cinemas around Europe over the past few weeks. “We have been using AI to help determine what is played, at what screen, and at which cinemas [to optimize revenues],” he said. “Our operating systems have been tweaked to social distance customers. It recognizes if you are with family and it will cocoon you. At the moment we are probably able to use 50% of cinemas’ capacities. “We can control the number of people in the foyer at any one time. Crowds would not be conducive to helping customers feel comfortable coming back. Every member of staff went through two days of safety training.” Richards said when he did reopen his movie theaters there was pent-up demand from customers but no new movies to screen. “We still managed at 50% run rate with classic movies that were not only already available on streaming services but on terrestrial television as well. People just wanted to get out of their homes and have some kind of normalcy.” Christopher Nolan’s complex thriller “Tenet” is the first major new film to be released and Richards said: “We are seeing ‘Tenet’ performing at the same levels as ‘Inception’ and ‘Interstellar’ did which has been amazing. “It will be a bumpy road in some areas but we expect a return to normalcy in six months — it will take a couple of months to get people comfortable again with their positions.” “Netflix has been disruptive for everything in the home,” he said. “We are out of the home, so Netflix is complementary to us because most people who like film like film on all formats. “I’ve seen the demise of the industry predicted definitely five or six times. We have been counter cyclical during downturns — we are reasonably priced so people come out and enjoy what we have to offer.” Rupert Steiner is Barron's Group bureau chief for the Europe, Middle East and Africa region.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/im-60-my-spouse-is-45-can-i-retire-if-our-expenses-are-12000-a-month-2020-09-02?mod=home-page",
    "text": "I have read a few of your HelpMeRetire inquiries, and I have a situation that I can’t seem to find much information about when I read retirement planning guides. I am 60 years old, and my spouse is 45. Currently, we both make over $300,000, and he is steadily moving up in his career; however, we only have about $1.5 million in savings (401(k)s and IRAs), and we still owe about $500,000 on our home. Our living expenses aren’t extravagant, but we do like to travel. I would guess taking into account all expenses, including our mortgage, to be around $12,000 a month. However, the house should be paid off in approximately seven years. Also, my husband has health insurance coverage for both of us through his employer. See: I’m 52, won’t live past 80 and have $1.6 million. ‘I am tired of both the rat race and workplace politics.’ Should I retire? Truthfully, your question is a bit difficult to answer without a few more details, such as if that $1.5 million is mostly in your retirement accounts or his or if you have any assets outside of those accounts. I will tell you what the financial advisers told me about this situation in general. I hope it helps you and fellow readers! To answer your question: It really depends on numerous factors. I read your question as though you earn $300,000 combined, in which case, if you contribute disproportionately more to your joint income, then no, it may not be the best decision to retire right now. Why? Because you would have to draw down your savings more quickly than if you could rely on your spouse’s salary for most if not all of your annual expenses, and doing so poses a problem later in life when he is closer to retirement age. Now, if you earn about the same, or if he earns more, there’s wiggle room for you to retire without worrying as much about the monthly bills. The other benefits to this equation: you’ve included your mortgage into your monthly expenses, your spouse’s employer offers health insurance and you are older than 59.5 years old, which means if the money is in retirement accounts in your name there are no penalty fees for withdrawing assets early. Comparatively, say you do earn $300,000 each, then yes, the numbers suggest you could retire now and continue paying your current expenses. But you may want to double and triple check your monthly expenses if that’s the case, said Lora Hoff, wealth manager at IPI Wealth Management, as it would indicate you currently have a significant amount of money unspent at the end of the year. There are other things to consider besides the ability to continue paying current expenses, advisers said. For example, thinking about your cash flow now and for the next few decades is crucial given the age difference, said Joyce Streithorst, director of financial planning at Frisch Financial Group. “They must make sure that they are funding through both retirements,” she said. “If we are planning their cash flow and finances to age 90 or 95, we are planning for the next 50 years!” You should review all of your assets — in retirement accounts and outside — and run the numbers to see if you’d have to tap into any of them, as well as which, and at what point. Also consider the tax implications of these decisions, Streithorst said. If you’re drawing down retirement assets, that money will be taxed at the top marginal bracket. If you’re married filing jointly, you’re in the 24% federal bracket. The good news: There is no income tax in Florida and retiring would put you in a lower bracket, she said. Ask yourselves: What money will we be using to pay our current and future expenses, and what are the most tax-advantageous ways to do that? Let’s talk about your mortgage for a second. Paying off $500,000 in seven years is quite the feat. Many advisers say entering retirement with a mortgage isn’t an issue, but you may want to review this expense before leaving the workforce since it is quite hefty. “I personally do not like my clients to carry a mortgage on their residence into retirement as it means their monthly income needs to be that much higher in order to cover their bills,” said Shaun Melby, a financial adviser and founder of Melby Wealth. “If they have a significant asset base, it might not be an issue. But if they don’t have that, it means their nest egg is going to be spent down at a faster rate.” Given your income level, it may be easier to try to pay down the mortgage a bit quicker, Melby said. Streithorst suggests asking yourselves a few other questions as well: Do you plan on ever downsizing your home? Would it be before the seven years are up, at your spouse’s retirement or later? If you’re thinking about doing it sooner than his retirement date, it could reduce your monthly expenditures significantly, she said. You asked about your retirement but I am compelled to ask you about your spouse’s as well, so that you both live comfortably in the future. Have you spoken to your spouse about his retirement goals? A wide age gap between spouses means having to make a few extra considerations in the retirement planning process. Also see: I’m a 57-year-old nurse with no retirement savings and I want to retire within seven years. What can I do? One thought: Social Security. You personally cannot claim Social Security yet (no one can until age 62 at the earliest), but if possible, it’d be best for you to delay claiming benefits for as long as you can, Melby said. The latest you can begin benefits is 70 years old, which not only maximizes the money you’ll get every month from Social Security — but your husband’s spousal benefits as well, he said. The decision to claim Social Security is very personal, and depends on numerous points, such as if you need the money sooner rather than later or what your anticipated life expectancy is, but it’s worth deliberating about when it would make the most sense for the both of you. Other considerations to make: if you have or need life insurance or a trust, and what your wishes are for your money now and in the future, said Michael Whitman, managing partner of Millennium Planning Group. Long-term care insurance is also beneficial, Hoff said, especially with you and your spouse’s age difference. “That will be more important for the remaining spouse,” she said. You can learn more about that here. You may want to reach out to a financial planner, who can walk you through the best options and help you plan for moments and issues you may not be thinking about right now. “There are a lot of other details that come into play with this besides income and expenses,” Whitman said.

    "title": "Opinion: How retirees should invest in a time of record-low interest rates",
    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/retirees-are-working-harder-just-to-avoid-falling-behind-2020-09-02?mod=home-page",
    "text": "Retirees these days are caught on a treadmill. Their retirement portfolios have become addicted to low and declining interest rates, both to preserve and possibly increase the value of their bondholdings but also to keep the stock bull market chugging along. Yet those ever-lower interest rates mean that it now takes more money to purchase the same retirement standard of living. In other words, retirees are running harder just to stay even. One way of appreciating this treadmill is to focus on how much less of an annuity you can purchase today with $100,000 than you could have 10 or 20 years ago. This is illustrated in the accompanying chart, which plots the monthly annuity payout that a single 65-year old male could have purchased with $100,000. Two decades ago, that $100,000 could have purchased a guaranteed lifetime income of $650 a month. With $100,000 today, in contrast, you can only purchase a guaranteed monthly payment of $465. The chart also plots the yield on triple-A rated corporate bonds. Notice the striking correlation with annuity payout rates. Vincent Deluard, head of global macro strategy at investment firm StoneX, refers to this as a “death loop”: Retirees “need lower rates so that equities keep rising despite the lack of healthy economic growth. At the same time, lower yields…prevent them from having any hope of meeting their return targets.” How can retirees get off this treadmill? The only solution I can see is to take some money off the table, so to speak. And I don’t just mean lowering your equity exposure; I also mean reducing your bond exposure as well. That’s because both asset classes are stuck on this same treadmill. I suggest you consider buying an annuity with some of the proceeds of lowering your equity and fixed-income exposures. That might seem surprising, given the above chart, but there are at least two compelling reasons to nevertheless consider one: • This treadmill can’t last forever, even if it can continue a while longer. As Deluard puts it, “I am entirely certain that the system is unsustainable over the long-term…Although I cannot predict when, I am certain that the gods of math and reality will eventually punish the mistaken disciples of the bull market cult.” If the market were to fall from here, the annuity you could purchase would be even less attractive than the one you could buy today. • In any case, you shouldn’t exaggerate the extent to which today’s annuity payout rates are less attractive than they were two decades ago. That’s because, after adjusting for inflation and prevailing interest rates, the situation isn’t as bad as it seems. Consider the net present value, or NPV, of the annuity payouts that my hypothetical 65-year old single male is able to purchase with $100,000, assuming his life expectancy is equal to what the Social Security Administration assumes is average for his age and gender, and using the triple-A rated corporate bond yield as the discount rate. On those assumptions, the annuity he could have purchased at the beginning of 2003 had a NPV of $77,702; the NPV of the comparable annuity purchased today is $73,188. How much of your retirement portfolio should you allocate to an annuity? Some retirement analysts recommend about one-third. For example, David Blanchett, head of retirement research at Morningstar, analyzed 78,000 possible retirement scenarios based on different assumptions about the markets’ rates of return, life expectancies, varying allocations to an annuity, and so forth. In each case, he calculated the annuity allocation that would have produced the best outcome for the retiree. On average, he found, that the optimal allocation was 30.52%. It should go without saying, but I’ll say it nonetheless: You should exercise great care in choosing the correct annuity product. There are many different annuity products, and comparing them can be hopelessly complex. Some come with excessive fees. By all means you should consult with a qualified financial planner who is skilled in analyzing the pluses and minuses of each bell and whistle. What if you hate the idea of reducing your equity exposure and thereby forfeiting the gain you would realize if the stock market continues to rise ever further? There is an annuity product that at least partially responds to this fear of missing out. Known as a Fixed Income Annuity (FIA), such an annuity never goes down in value but returns a percentage of the market’s gain in those years in which it rises. As always, the devil is in the details. I devoted a column in early April to some of those details, and I refer you to it for a more complete discussion. To repeat, furthermore, make sure you discuss the possibilities with a qualified financial planner. Mark Hulbert is a regular contributor to MarketWatch.

    "text": "I am one of four children and my father died naming my brother the executor of his will. My father died with no debt, and a home that was mortgage free in the best neighborhood. He had worked for the same company for over 45 years with a pension and savings throughout his life. My brother and his wife moved into dad’s home even though they own their own home. They changed the locks, and hired an alarm company so no one could enter the property. They also refused to give anyone a copy of the will until after he presented it to the court, so they claimed. They began blowing through my dad’s money (using his accounts, credit cards that were in dad’s name only) and refused to present and perform the duties of executor. My brother and his wife were in serious financial debt prior to dad’s death. When I confronted my brother he blocked me on social media, and has refused to talk to me ever since. My brother was my best friend. His actions have destroyed me to the core. During all of these events, he and his wife divorced. She initiated the divorce when the money ran low. She filed for bankruptcy while still spending and taking exotic trips, which she posted all over Facebook. I sent my brother money throughout this time to help with divorce costs, and begged him to show up at her bankruptcy hearing and acknowledge that they committed fraud. He still refused to speak to me. I am so hurt by this whole situation. My dad, a hard working Vietnam vet, lies in an unmarked grave, which is ridiculous because he had a substantial amount of money, including funds from a $25,000 insurance policy from my grandfather. The Moneyist:‘A man cave on wheels’: My husband’s RV is his pride and joy — but he owes $75,000 on it. If he dies, am I liable? I feel cheated and used. I don’t even have a picture of my parents. I need closure and I want to pursue criminal charges against my brother and my former sister-in-law through the state attorney general’s office. I’ve spoken to several lawyers in this small town, and everyone says, “Let it go, your brother is a good guy.” Meanwhile, I’m supposed to suffer in silence with no relief. I tried and I can’t. I wake up daily crying from it all. I have no relationship with my sisters. One sister stole my identity in the past causing me great distress and financially ruining me. My brother knew this, so his actions hurt that much more. It seems that you want justice for your father and peace of mind for yourself. Those two things can be mutually exclusive. You can have one without the other.  If you do not succeed in prosecuting your brother for breaking his fiduciary duty as the executor, it does not mean that you can’t move on. Not everyone is willing or able to take responsibility for their actions, and that’s OK. Your biggest responsibility is to yourself. Whatever happens with your father’s home and what’s left of his estate, and whatever becomes of your brother, you want to be free. That is your ultimate goal. There is a statute of limitations on wills, and the clock usually starts ticking after the will has been filed with the probate court. Of course, we don’t know for sure if your father’s will was filed with the probate court and, if there was no will, his estate would still need to go through probate. The statute also varies by state. There are different deadlines for trusts and wills that apply to different claims, and those statues can change depending on circumstances, according to Albertson & Davidson, a law firm in El Segundo, Calif. “You must contest a will before it is admitted to probate,” the law firm states. “If a will is admitted to probate, then you have 120 days in which to ask the court to revoke probate. After that time frame, the will cannot be challenged.” It is not clear whether your father’s will was filed. “Probate is a court process by which the court first determines if a will is valid, then appoints an executor to administer the will in a court-supervised process. When a court issues an order declaring the will is valid, we call this ‘admitting the will to probate,’” the firm adds. The Moneyist: My father left me money for a house — and my husband put his name on the deed. How do I ensure it goes to our kids? There is possible good news for your case: “If you want to sue a trustee for breach of trust, then you have three years to do so from the date you knew, or should have known, of the facts giving rise to the breach,” according to Albertson & Davidson. But if you are never given an accounting or a report, there is no statute for fraud. “If you did not know what the trustee did, and the trustee never gave you an accounting or written report disclosing his actions, then your deadline to sue remains open indefinitely,” it says. “Obviously, you should not wait forever to take action against your trustee,” the law firm says. “At some point in time, it will become difficult, if not impossible, to hold your trustee liable for harms if you do not take action.” You need to find a reputable law firm in your town or state. Like I said, the deadline on taking action differs from state to state, but this gives you an idea of what you’re facing. Failing that, you may wish to make peace with the fact that your brother cannot be the brother you want him to be, nor can he be the son your father thought he was. If nothing else comes of this, you could work towards getting enough money for your father’s gravestone as a tribute for all that he accomplished in life as a father and as a veteran. You can say goodbye to your father, and thank him for the life he gave you. But your happiness cannot and should not depend on the outcome of this case or the resolution of the broken relationship with your brother. Your father gave you the tools during your lifetime to seek the kind of life you want for yourself, independent of the misdeeds of others. This is the most important goal for you to pursue.

    "title": "Before fleeing the city for the suburbs, think of the impact on your taxes, utility bills, maintenance costs — and your commute",
    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/thinking-of-moving-from-the-city-to-the-suburbs-amid-the-pandemic-5-financial-factors-you-should-consider-first-2020-09-03?mod=home-page",
    "text": "Sick of being cramped inside a small apartment where you now not only live, but work and teach your kids, too? You’re far from alone these days. But buying a home and moving to the suburbs is far from a fool-proof decision from a financial perspective, even in an era of rock-bottom mortgage rates. Many city dwellers have taken a newfound interest in suburban and rural living as the coronavirus pandemic has transformed our daily lives and living spaces. Sales of new and existing homes have skyrocketed in recent months thanks to a combination of pent-up demand from the spring and city residents entering the market in search of more space. “We’ve been speculating about increasing interest in the suburbs and rural areas since the start of the pandemic,” Redfin economist Taylor Marr said in a recent report from the real-estate brokerage firm. “Now we’re seeing concrete evidence that rural and suburban neighborhoods are more attractive to homebuyers than the city, partly because working from home means commute times are no longer a major factor for some people.” But the price of the home and the interest rate you can get on a mortgage are just two of the financial factors that buyers need to consider before renting a U-Haul to live the suburban life. Here are five other factors to consider when calculating the cost of such a move: Property taxes accounted for more than 30% of all the tax revenue that state and local governments collected from Americans in fiscal year 2017, according to the right-leaning Tax Foundation. Property taxes are the single largest form of state and local tax revenue, the think tank said. Though property taxes can go as low as a median of $200 in some places, the five counties with the highest median property tax bills are in suburbs surrounding New York City, according to Tax Foundation data. The 2018 median bill in these counties — Bergen and Essex in New Jersey and Nassau, Rockland and Westchester in New York — exceeded $10,000. It’s important to keep the tax burden in context, said Jared Walczak, the Tax Foundation’s vice president of state projects. “All-in suburban property costs tend to be lower than those in prosperous downtowns, but the property tax itself may be higher. This is certainly true for some of the wealthiest suburbs of cities like New York and Philadelphia, but isn’t necessarily true across the country.” Still, he added, “even if property taxes are higher, overall taxes are lower in the suburbs. For instance, both New York and Philadelphia impose high municipal income taxes that neighboring jurisdictions lack.” Median property tax bills in some Illinois counties and Bay Area counties of California can range between $6,000 and $7,000, according to Tax Foundation data. Be ready to potentially pay more in utilities if you are living in the suburbs with more space to heat or cool — especially if you are working from home and running fans, computers, appliances and other electronics during the work day. A typical New York City customer paid a $94.25 electric bill in July, according to spokesman Allan Drury. Meanwhile, a Westchester customer paid $112.99. That’s not even a $20 difference, but the costs add up. From January to July, the typical Westchester customer paid almost $135 more for electricity alone, the ConEd data show. It’s not a hard and fast rule that suburbanites will pay more, Drury noted. It comes down to energy usage, and someone in the city could use more power than someone in the suburbs. There’s also the water bill and other possible expenses like fees for garbage removal. Those may or may not be included in town services. The average monthly water bill in the U.S. is around $70, according to Move.org, a website with tips on moving and listings for moving companies. Trash removal can range from $30 to $50, according to Homeadvisor.com. City-dwellers need to remember they already pay for these services in a certain way, said Alison Bernstein, president and founder of The Suburban Jungle, a real estate firm that focuses on moves out of cities into suburbs. Client demand is up 500% year-over-year from the second and third quarter of last year compared to this one, she noted. Water bills and garbage fees might just be wrapped up into the rent and common charges people pay in the city. Prospective buyers eyeing a particular house should ask about monthly utility costs to get a better sense of the incidental costs, Bernstein said. The downside of owning your home is you will no longer have a building super or landlord to handle fixing the leaking pipes and chipped paint — or pay for it. “The amount of money that any homeowner should budget for annual upkeep and maintenance is anywhere between 1% and 4% of the value of the home,” said Dana Menard, founder and CEO of Twin Cities Wealth Strategies, a financial advisory firm based in Maple Grove, Minn. In other words, for a home worth $320,000, you can expect to pay between $3,200 and $12,800 a year on maintenance, Menard said. And if you choose to buy a home in a neighborhood with a homeowners’ association, you may face added costs for maintenance services such as lawn care as part of your HOA fees. Between public transit and tightly clustered neighborhoods, you don’t need a car in many major cities. (That’s part of the allure for some who don’t want to deal with parking rules.) But in the more spread-out suburbs, life without a car could be trickier — especially if you’ve got kids in tow. A move to the suburbs might also mean getting a second vehicle, depending on a particular family’s work schedule and lifestyle needs. People need to figure out what’s best for them, said Bernstein. “Anything can work, you just have to plan ahead and factor that into your life.” If it means buying a car, people should realize the new and used market isn’t what it was a couple months ago, said Michelle Krebs, executive analyst at Cox Automotive, the parent company of brands including Kelley Blue Book. Around March and April, many car makers trying to move new vehicles off the lot were offering 0% financing for the life of the loan to buyers with excellent credit. “People grabbed those. As inventory has dwindled down, those deals have started to dry up,” Krebs said. In July, a new vehicle cost $38,378, which is up from $37,629 at the same point last year. Between supply chain woes and new social distancing protocols at automotive plants, Krebs thinks inventory will stay low for the rest of the year — and that won’t give dealers a lot of leeway to haggle. “The normal channel for used cars has also been disrupted,” Krebs said. For example, drivers are not trading in their vehicles and lenders are giving cash-strapped drivers forbearance on loans, which means cars are not being re-possessed. Earlier in August , the average price of a used car was $20,212, the second consecutive week where the price exceeded $20,000. The average used car price hasn’t broken the $20,000 mark in the years Krebs has been tracking the number. Owning a bigger house will eventually mean needing furniture to fill the additional rooms. And many first-time homeowners find themselves in a trap where they can’t resist buying that furniture right away. Doing so could be a huge mistake, Menard said. “Many people make the mistake of pulling out the credit card to take care of it quickly,” he said. Because many homeowners don’t think to budget for those impulsive purchases, they often don’t have the funds to cover the credit card balance. Therefore, buying the fixings to spruce up your new abode with credit cards can “ultimately add an additional 25% to 50% of costs,” Menard said, once the interest rate on the credit card is factored in. Currently, the average annual percentage rate for credit cards is 16%, according to CreditCards.com. Jacob Passy is a personal-finance reporter for MarketWatch and is based in New York.

    "text": "Tyler Perry loves when people say he came from “humble beginnings.” To the high school dropout, that just means a “dirt poor” upbringing, which was most definitely the case for Perry. He was raised in poverty and spent time roaming the streets of New Orleans as a homeless playwright searching for a break. Those hungry days are long gone, however, as Perry, now a true media mogul, just climbed his way on to the Forbes billionaire list. He reportedly has earned more than $1.4 billion since blowing up back 2005 and owns a massive studio worth about $280 million. Here’s how Forbes breaks down Perry’s wealth. “Ownership changes everything,” Perry explained to Forbes, referring to his studio, which sits on what was once a Confederate military stronghold. “I own the lights. I own the sets. So that’s where the difference is. Because I own everything, my returns are higher.” Perry is best known for his string of movie hits based on a character named Madea, a tough old lady he created and stars as in 11 films. Forbes says Perry, America’s seventh Black billionaire, currently has “a clear path” to membership in the Forbes 400, which means he’ll have to accrue more than $2 billion in net worth, according to 2019’s threshold. Perry spends his wealth on homes in Atlanta, New York, Los Angeles, and Jackson Hole, Wyoming, as well as on two private planes, Forbes reported. With much of the market recovering from its March lows, it is no wonder that investors are looking for opportunities in beaten-up sectors. And bank stocks certainly fit the bill.

    "text": "Robinhood Markets Inc. faces a civil fraud investigation over its early failure to fully disclose its practice of selling clients’ orders to high-speed trading firms, people familiar with the matter said. The investigation is at an advanced stage and the company could have to pay a fine exceeding $10 million if it agrees to settle the Securities and Exchange Commission probe, one of the people said. A deal, however, is unlikely to be announced this month, the people said, and the two sides haven’t formally negotiated a proposed fine, the person said. A Robinhood spokeswoman declined to comment on the investigation or any talks with regulators, but said: “We strive to maintain constructive relationships with our regulators and to cooperate fully with them.” An SEC spokeswoman declined to comment. The probe is the latest headache for the upstart brokerage firm that was founded in 2013 and has developed a hugely popular app that allows individuals to trade stocks, options and cryptocurrencies without paying any commissions. While Robinhood has seen phenomenal growth this year, the Menlo Park, Calif.-based firm has faced setbacks such as outages that prevented customers from trading, the cancellation of its plans to expand to the U.K. and fallout from the suicide of a 20-year-old Robinhood customer who thought he had lost money from a sophisticated options trade.

    "text": "E-cigarette maker Juul Labs Inc. said it is planning another significant round of layoffs and considering halting sales across Europe and Asia. That could mean pulling out of as many as 11 countries and shrinking the startup’s footprint to its core markets of the U.S., Canada and the U.K. Juul cut about one-third of its 3,000 workers earlier this year and already has halted sales of its vaporizers in several countries. The once fast-growing company has been scaling back its operations to combat a sharp drop in sales. It currently has about 2,200 employees. Widely blamed by parents and government officials for a surge in teen vaping in the U.S., Juul has faced regulatory crackdowns and investigations into its marketing practices over past two years. Now its sales are falling as Reynolds American Inc.’s Vuse e-cigarette brand gains market share and some vapers switch back to traditional cigarettes. Juul Chief Executive K.C. Crosthwaite told employees in an email Wednesday that the business units under review don’t generate enough revenue to support further spending there. He said the cuts would allow the company to invest in developing new products, in technology to curb youth use and in scientific research that could help the company demonstrate to regulators that its products are less harmful than cigarettes. Juul has submitted to the Food and Drug Administration a new version of its vaporizer designed to unlock only for users at least 21 years old, according to people familiar with the matter. An expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com. Also popular on WSJ.com: Mnuchin urges Congress to pass more stimulus funding. COVID-19 deaths significantly reduced by use of steroids, analysis says. The number of confirmed cases of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 worldwide edged closer to 26 million on Wednesday, as experts sounded the alarm on the Trump administration’s decision not to work with an international effort to develop and distribute a COVID-19 vaccine that is backed by the World Health Organization.

    "text": "CrowdStrike Holdings Inc.  shares retreated from 2020’s meteoric rise in the extended session Wednesday after the cloud-based cybersecurity company topped Wall Street estimates, with more businesses seeking to protect their systems as employees work from home. Revenue rose to $199 million from $108.1 million in the year-ago quarter. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had estimated a loss of a penny a share on revenue of $188.6 million, based on CrowdStrike’s forecast adjusted loss of 2 cents a share to break-even on revenue of $185.8 million to $190.3 million . Shares declined 7% after hours, following a 1.1% decline in the regular session to close at $142.07, after nearly tripling in price year to date. Since the COVID-19 pandemic has forced millions to log onto corporate networks from home, CrowdStrike has benefited from the need for more dynamic security measures, reporting its first-ever adjusted profit last quarter.  CrowdStrike has been publicly traded for a little more than a year, following its June 2019 IPO that priced at $34 a share. CrowdStrike also gained notoriety less than a year ago after President Donald Trump referenced the company in his  phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in trying to get information on  Democratic political rival Joe Biden and his son. In the first half of 2020, CrowdStrike’s Kurtz said the number of “distinct and sophisticated” intrusions into sensitive systems jumped more than 150%, and that the company stopped about 41,000 potential breaches, more than all of last year. “Many of the security leaders we spoke with believe that experiencing a breach now, while their business is under extreme stress due to the impact of COVID, will be far more detrimental to their business versus last year,” Kurtz said. Annual recurring revenue, a software-as-a-service metric that shows how much revenue the company can expect based on subscriptions, rose 87% to $791 million for the quarter, while the Street expected $732 million.  Kurtz said CrowdStrike added a record $104 million in new ARR in the second quarter, and landed the “second-largest deal in the company history” with an unidentified customer. CrowdStrike expects an adjusted fiscal third-quarter loss of a penny a share to break even on revenue of $210.6 million to $215 million, while analysts forecast a loss of 5 cents a share on revenue of $195.9 million, according to FactSet. These tech companies have yet to report financial results for the quarter but have demonstrated they are benefiting from the pandemic.

Inc. shares were flat in after-hours trading Wednesday after the retailer reported yet another strong month of sales leading to its fiscal fourth-quarter results on Sept. 24. For the 16-week fourth quarter ended Aug. 30, Costco has reported net sales of $52.3 billion, an increase of 12.7% compared to net sales of $46.4 billion during the similar period last year. The numbers placed an emphatic stamp on the popularity and success of the company during the pandemic, and strongly suggest it will match if not exceed the $51.9 billion in fourth-quarter revenue expected from analysts surveyed by FactSet. Store growth is an “underappreciated, long-term growth driver for Costco,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Scot Ciccarelli said in an Aug. 20 note, in which he maintained an outperform rating and $381 price target on Costco’s stock. The company has outperformed in 2020, he said, as shoppers flock to stores for low-price essentials.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/united-airlines-plans-to-furlough-16000-workers-fewer-than-expected-2020-09-02?mod=home-page",
    "text": "United Airlines said Wednesday it plans to furlough 16,370 employees in October, a smaller number than the airline predicted in July because thousands of workers agreed to leave with the travel industry facing a slow recovery from the pandemic. Airline officials had outlined 36,000 potential furloughs in July. Since then, thousands of workers took early retirement, buyouts, or long-term leaves of absence. Flight attendants will bear the brunt of the cuts, with 6,920 getting furlough notices. About 2,850 pilots, 2,260 airport-based employees, 2,010 maintenance workers and 1,400 management and support staff would also lose their jobs. The figures do not include the 7,400 employees who took buyouts or early retirement. Up to 20,000 more accepted reduced work schedules or took voluntary leaves lasting up to 13 months. Most union employees in the airline industry whose jobs are cut have rehiring rights — management and administrative staff generally do not. United began the year with 96,000 employees, 84% of whom were represented by unions. The flight attendants’ union said United’s announcement understates the job losses. The union said more than 15,000 flight attendants will leave the United payroll unless Washington approves more payroll aid for airlines, and another 3,400 who stay to keep health insurance will get no guarantee of work or income. “Where will we go? The unemployment line,” said Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants. “The situation in the airline industry is not better than July when furlough notices went out. It’s actually worse.” United officials said they were still discussing ways to limit pilot furloughs. Airlines are cautious about furloughing too many pilots because federal requirements for ongoing training mean it takes longer to bring them back. Airlines don’t need all their workers because air travel has plunged during the pandemic. Even with a modest recovery since April, U.S. air travel is down about 70% from a year ago, costing the airlines billions in revenue. The airlines have cut schedules — United’s schedule this month is only 37% of its schedule in September 2019 — slashed expenses and borrowed billions to survive the pandemic. Josh Earnest, a United senior vice president, said the Chicago-based airline doesn’t expect travel to return to normal until a vaccine for COVID-19 is widely available, and that the recovery is likely to be uneven. The airline expects to recall furloughed workers piecemeal, he indicated. “We don’t have to snap everybody back at the same time,” he told reporters. “We can basically build our workforce as we need it and as our schedule grows and as demand recovers.” Airlines that accepted federal aid to cover payrolls have been barred from furloughing or laying off workers since March. United took $5 billion in payroll cash and loans. United and other airlines and their unions are lobbying for another round of payroll support that would run through next March, but the proposal is in limbo because of stalled negotiations between the White House and congressional Democrats over another large virus-relief measure. President Donald Trump repeated Tuesday that his administration plans to help the airlines, but he didn’t give any specifics.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/u-s-budget-deficit-to-hit-record-3-3-trillion-this-year-cbo-says-11599070944?mod=home-page",
    "text": "The U.S. government will run its biggest budget shortfall ever this year, at $3.311 trillion, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said Wednesday. The government’s fiscal year ends Sept. 30 and the record fiscal deficit had long been seen as a fait accompli in light of the massive levels of government support for the economy in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. “This pandemic is tragic on so many fronts and today’s massive borrowing is a cost of mitigating this pain. The warning bells this report contains should not cause a premature end to borrowing, but a commitment to dealing with the debt at the appropriate time,” said Maya MacGuineas, president of the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. The Treasury and the Office of Management and Budget will announce the official results sometime in October, if the Trump administration sticks to the usual release pattern. The CBO number was, however, slightly better than had been expected in April. Back then, the CBO was projecting a $3.7 trillion deficit for this budget year and a $2.1 trillion shortfall in 2021. The projected 2021 deficit was trimmed back to $1.810 trillion in the new forecast. In comparison to the size of the economy, a measure most economists say better reflects the deficit’s fiscal burden, the 2020 deficit would be the largest since 1945, at 16.0% of Gross Domestic Product. That would be the fourth-largest deficit in proportion to the size of the economy, according to data kept by the Office of Management and Budget, after the years 1943 through 1945. The CBO projected most of the budgetary impact of the pandemic would be focused in 2020 and 2021, as its 10-year forecast window remained mostly unchanged from estimates made before the virus’ impact was known. “The cumulative deficit between 2021 and 2030 is projected to total $13.0 trillion (5.0 percent of GDP over that period), about the same as CBO projected in March. Lower projected wages, salaries, and corporate profits, as well as recent legislation and other changes, increase deficits, but that change is more than offset by lower projected interest rates and inflation, which decrease deficits,” CBO said. The report comes as Congress and the White House are likely to begin in September hammering out another bill to respond to the pandemic, despite being far apart on how much to spend. Four earlier coronavirus bills, including the $1.7 trillion CARES Act passed in March, were estimated by the CBO to cost $2.404 trillion combined. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, remain about $900 billion dollars apart on the next bill, with Pelosi arguing for the higher number of $2.2 trillion. Any spending resulting from another coronavirus bill would probably come too late to affect the 2020 fiscal year. For this year, the CBO said spending would total about 32% of GDP, also the highest level since 1945. Revenues were expected to fall to about 16% of GDP. The revenue picture CBO projected showed the sharp economic turn caused by the pandemic. Revenues were up by 6% overall in the first six months of the budget year, October 2019 to March, before dropping by 13% in the second half of the year. Offsetting some of that, though, was a sharp drop in  borrowing costs. While the amount of debt rose by 20% over 2019, net interest costs were projected to actually fall by $37 billion, the CBO said. “That drop occurs primarily because interest rates have been much lower in 2020 than they were in 2019,” CBO said. Over the 2020-’30 window, though, the  budget picture remained grim. The publicly held-debt-to-GDP percentage was estimated to hit 98% in 2020 and continue rising steadily to almost 109% in 2030. In that year, the debt was estimated to hit $33.457 trillion, or more than $13 trillion more than 2020’s level. On a nominal basis, the projected annual deficits shrink quickly in 2020 and 2021, then pause before rising near the end of the decade. The lowest projected deficit over the next decade is $1.080 trillion in 2027. “While managing the COVID-19 crisis must remain the top priority, whomever is sworn in as president next year will also need a plan to dig us out of this hole once the economy is stronger,” MacGuineas said. Michael Linden, executive director of Groundworks Collaborative, an advocacy group for progressive and inclusive economic policy, said the deficit numbers should not deter policymakers from thinking big. “Interest rates are at historic lows and it’s clearer than ever that the deficit isn’t a major concern — so the highest priority, and really the only responsible thing for our government to do, is support workers and families and make the major investments needed to end this crisis and put our economy on strong footing,” he said. The CBO also released a report taking a look at the health of government trust funds and concluded three will be unable to pay out the amounts required by law within the next decade. It said the Highway Trust Fund would hit its exhaustion date in 2021, with the Hospital Insurance portion of Medicare following in 2024 and Social Security’s Disability insurance fund in 2026. The timeline raised concern among public health experts about an “October surprise” — a vaccine approval driven by political considerations ahead of a presidential election, rather than science.

    "text": "The number of confirmed cases of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 worldwide edged closer to 26 million on Wednesday, as experts sounded the alarm on the Trump administration’s decision not to participate in an international effort to develop and distribute a COVID-19 vaccine that is backed by the World Health Organization. The news was not surprising, given that Trump has repeatedly criticized the WHO, calling it pro-China and is pulling the U.S. out of the world’s leading health organization. Rep. Ami Bera, D-Calif., said the decision was shortsighted and will hamper the battle to end the pandemic. “Joining COVAX is a simple measure to guarantee U.S. access to a vaccine — no matter who develops it first,” tweeted Bera, a medical doctor. “This go-it-alone approach leaves America at risk of not getting a vaccine.” The news came at a time when public health experts are concerned that even the top U.S. health agencies are becoming increasingly politicized under the current administration as Trump consistently rejects the advice of the doctors and scientists that head them and applying pressure on them to act as he, and his political fortunes, would prefer. Trump has played down the pandemic from the outset, has been inconsistent in promoting the safety measures they insist are key to containing the spread and even accused the Food and Drug Administration of being part of the “deep state.” The latest fear is that the U.S. is already pursuing an unstated herd-immunity policy, one that is backed by a new member of the White House pandemic team. The Washington Post reported this week that Dr. Scott Atlas, a neuroradiologist from Stanford’s Hoover Institution, is pushing for the U.S. to follow Sweden’s example, which has been widely criticized for a death toll that is far higher than that of neighboring countries. Atlas is not an infectious-disease expert or an epidemiologist. Herd immunity is the notion that once a high proportion of a population has contracted or been vaccinated against an infectious disease, the likelihood of others in the population being infected is drastically reduced. Sweden did not lock down or even enforce restrictions on movement, relying instead on its citizens to responsibly follow safety guidelines. The country has recorded 57.08 deaths from COVID-19 per 100,000 people, just ahead of the U.S.’s 56.44 per 100,000 people, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University. By comparison, neighboring Finland has had just 6.09 deaths per 100,000 people, the data show. Gregg Gonsalves, assistant professor of epidemiology of microbial diseases at the Yale School of Public Health and co-director of the Global Health Justice Partnership, told Democracy Now on Monday that the U.S. is now ‘implicitly’ taking a herd-immunity tack. “Many people in the public health community have watched this with horror, the sort of implicit herd-immunity strategy,” he said. The Trump administration realizes it is politically toxic, he said, “so they don’t want to use the phrase, but if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it is a duck. And this is essentially a herd-immunity strategy.” Gonsalves joined those criticizing the head of the FDA, Dr. Stephen Hahn, for kowtowing to the White House in granting an emergency-use authorization for the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine, which has been found ineffective and potentially dangerous in clinical trials, and more recently granting an EUA for convalescent plasma, which has not been fully tested, and announcing it in a televised briefing promoted by Trump as a major event. A National Institutes of Health advisory group focused on COVID-19 said Tuesday that the efficacy and safety of convalescent plasma as a treatment for hospitalized coronavirus patients is still unknown, based on its assessment of published and unpublished clinical data. Hahn said at the weekend that he would consider an EUA for a potential vaccine, even before the end of Phase 3 trials. “The danger about the vaccine EUA before Phase 3 trial results are out is much more dire, because we give treatments to the sick and, in this case, to many people who are hospitalized,” said Gonsalves. “Vaccines go to millions of people. We depend on them to be effective, so people don’t get the wrong impression about what they should be doing in terms of social distancing and other behavior because they’re vaccinated.” The newly influential Atlas is also skeptical of face masks and does not believe that children can pass on the virus, according to a New York Times report. It cited one expert, Dr. Carlos del Rio, an infectious-disease expert at Emory University, as saying Trump did not like the advice he was getting from long-standing public health experts including Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Diseases, and Dr. Deborah Birx, coordinator of the White House task force, while Atlas is saying what the president wants to hear. • Australia has entered its first recession almost 30 years because of the pandemic, the BBC reported on Wednesday. Australian GDP fell 7% in the April-through-June quarter, after a fall of 0.3% in the first quarter. An economy is deemed to be in recession once it suffers two consecutive quarters of negative growth. Australia was the only major economy to avoid recession during the 2008 financial crisis, when it was buoyed by demand from China for its commodities and natural resources. • Also from Australia, former Prime Minister Tony Abbott is facing a backlash after he suggested that some elderly patients with the virus should be allowed to die, letting nature take its course. Abbott said politicians were not “thinking like health economists trained to pose uncomfortable questions about the level of deaths we might have to live with.” He made the comments in a speech at the Policy Exchange in London. • A surge in news cases in South Korea is mostly being led by older people, the Guardian reported. More than 40% of the new cases in the country involve people who are older than 60, the paper said. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 267 new cases on Tuesday, boosting the total to 20,449, with 326 total deaths. The latest rise in cases is pushing hospitals in Seoul to capacity with just 3% of beds now available for non-COVID critical cases, compared with 22% some 10 days ago. • Italy’s former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has tested positive for COVID-19, according to media reports. The 83-year old, who was PM in four different governments, is isolating at a home near Milan, according to a statement distributed by his staff. Berlusconi recently visited Sardinia, which experienced a spike in cases in August as tourists from across Italy arrived for vacation, Reuters reported. • Germany is not going to have another lockdown in winter, according to its health minister, Jens Spahn, speaking at a press briefing. Spahn said experts are learning more about the virus every day and would not make the same decisions if cases spike again in the colder months. “We are learning where the dangers are greatest, sadly when we socialize and celebrate together,” he said, according to a Reuters report. There are now 25.8 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide, according to the Johns Hopkins data, and at least 858,661 people have died. More than 17 million people are confirmed to have tested positive and recovered. The U.S. has the highest case tally at 6.09 million and the highest death toll at 185,123. Brazil is second with 3.9 million cases and 122,596 deaths. India is third with 3.8 million cases and 66,333 deaths. Russia, Peru, South Africa and Colombia are next as measured by cases. Mexico has 606,036 cases and 65,241 deaths, the fourth highest in the world, followed by the U.K. with its 339,420 cases and 41,592 deaths, the most in Europe and fifth highest in the world. China, where the illness was first reported late last year, says it has 89,942 confirmed cases and  4,726 deaths. A new study by Reykjavik-based deCODE Genetics, a subsidiary of the U.S. biotech company Amgen, with several hospitals, universities and health officials in Iceland, found that antibodies that people make to fight the new coronavirus last for at least four months after diagnosis and do not fade quickly, as some earlier reports suggested, the Associated Press reported. The study was based on tests on more than 30,000 people in Iceland, a popular center for medical research because of its small and closely related population and a long history of keeping careful medical records. Some smaller studies previously suggested that antibodies may disappear quickly and that some people with few or no symptoms may not make many at all. The results don’t necessarily mean that all countries’ populations will be the same, or that every person has this sort of response. Other scientists recently documented cases where people have been reinfected with the coronavirus months after their first bout. There is growing scientific consensus that steroids like dexamethasone should be the leading treatment option for severely ill COVID-19 patients, according to three new studies published Wednesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association, MarketWatch’s Jaimy Lee reported. Researchers at the University of Oxford in the U.K. reported in mid-June that low doses of dexamethasone reduced deaths in hospitalized COVID-19 patients on ventilators by one-third or those receiving oxygen support by one-fifth. The new studies reinforce the benefits of steroids when treating some severely ill coronavirus patients. “These trials and the meta-analysis have strengthened confidence, further defined the benefit, and shifted usual care of COVID-19-related ARDS to include corticosteroids,” researchers wrote in an accompanying editorial. “However, many clinically important questions remain.” The World Health Organization on Wednesday recommended corticosteroids for patients with severe forms of COVID-19. Private-sector companies added or regained 428,000 jobs in August, ADP said Wednesday, but the modest gain won’t dispel worries about a slowdown in hiring over the summer as new outbreaks threatened the economy’s recovery from the worst of the pandemic, MarketWatch’s Jeffry Bartash reported. Wall Street economists had forecast an increase of 1 million private-sector jobs, according to Econoday. The increase in hiring last month surpassed a revised job gain of 212,000 in July, the giant payroll processor said. Initially ADP had reported that 167,000 new jobs were created in that month. The economy has recouped fewer than half of the 20 million–plus jobs lost in the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic. ”The U.S. labor-market recovery continued at a fairly sluggish pace in August,” said senior economist Andrew Grantham of CIBC Economics. A separate report found factory orders rose 6.4% in July in a third straight monthly increase, reflecting a rebound in manufacturing after the economy reopened. Economists polled by MarketWatch had forecast a 6.2% gain. Apple Inc.’s stock price will appear quite a bit lower Monday morning, but investors shouldn’t fret.

    "text": "This interview is the third in a series of conversations MarketWatch is conducting with some of the leading voices in the U.S. on the COVID-19 pandemic. Back in April, Dr. Dixie Harris and about 100 nurses and doctors from the Intermountain Healthcare hospital system in Utah flew to New York City to work in the region’s overburdened hospitals. Harris, a pulmonologist who studies e-cigarette vaping, worked for days in a row, caring for COVID-19 patients when the region’s local hospitals were overwhelmed. It was at Southside Hospital in Bay Shore, N.Y., that she started to learn about the virus, about why it’s better to put patients prone, why ventilators aren’t always the best option — and the importance of wearing a face mask. “One hundred of us went,” she said. “Zero came back positive.” Back home in the much more sparsely populated state of Utah, cases peaked at 876 on July 9, according to the Utah Department of Health. About 400 people in total have died as a result of a COVID-19 infection. (New York state has reported a total of 430,774 cases and 25,297 deaths as of Aug. 25.) As cases have declined, more of Harris’ focus has turned to patients who had COVID-19 in the spring and are still dealing with myriad health problems and symptoms months later. Many of these patients in the U.S. call themselves “long haulers.” They have reported fatigue, chest pain and neurological damage. “One of my first long-hauler patients had symptoms in March,” she said. “Five months later, and this patient was never in the hospital. That’s who I’m mostly seeing: patients who haven’t been in the hospital but continue to have ongoing symptoms.” Dr. Dixie Harris: We were there three weeks in April. It was pretty intense. It was right as the peak was going down, but there were still six times the number of ICU patients or more for the hospital I was working in. From what I could see, it hit pretty much within a week. It went from next to no COVID patients to overwhelming the whole system. I’ve had other people ask me, “Why didn’t they just ship some of those patients to another hospital?” Well, every hospital in Long Island was overrun with patients. And all the ambulances were so busy bringing new patients in, it’s not like they could say, “Oh, we’ll take this one patient all the way up to Albany. “ A tsunami is what they called it because there was no warning and it hit all at once. It was an incredibly dynamic learning environment. From when we started to when I left, care changed markedly. We were intubating early on. And then we said, “Wait a second, once they go on the ventilator, they’re on for three weeks. What can we do to avoid this?” The big key is proning. Even if you get some respiratory symptoms but you don’t have to be in the hospital, go ahead and move. Prone. Don’t just lay in the bed on your back at home. I will say it’s really hard to lay on your belly when your BMI is 45. When you’re really obese, it feels like you can’t breathe. So I tell the patients to sit up, lean forward. You’re trying to get the back upright. It was an honor to get to go there. The head of Northwell Health came when we were leaving about to get on the plane and came in to thank us. They did a water cannon salute in New York at the airport. When we were in the waiting area right at the jet way, probably 30, 40 people showed up and just gave us a shout-out clap. All wearing masks, all distanced. MarketWatch: It looks like Utah’s peak was in July. How is it different caring for patients there even now? Harris: We haven’t been overwhelmed. We have not had our ICUs completely full and so because of that we’re doing cutting edge best care possible. Every COVID patient is presented to infectious disease to decide which meds they qualify for. Harris: The laypeople are calling it long haulers. The British Medical Journal just did a nice review on management of post-acute COVID patients. They’re calling it long COVID. In the medical community, we haven’t fully named it. But I’m [also] aware of patients who consider themselves long haulers who have never (been) diagnosed positive for COVID. They feel they have it because they have the symptoms, the time frame, and all that. Harris: That’s really what we are just learning. Who I get are patients who two to three months later are still having shortness of breath, still having aches and pains, and maybe chest symptoms. Many of them are still on oxygen. Now mind you, we are at higher elevation. So some of these patients would not necessarily be hypoxic if they were at sea level. Still, these are people who are used to living here, so their body is adjusted to it. Dr. Kirk Knowlton, [Intermountain’s director of cardiovascular research, critical care physician Dr. Eliotte Hirshberg] and I are going to be talking to our leadership about developing protocols to take care of these patients. Part of it is to acknowledge that patients are still having symptoms. One of my first long-hauler patients had symptoms in March. I talked to the patient a week and a half ago, and he is still having a little bit of symptoms [but is] markedly better. Back to work now. But five months later, and this patient was never in the hospital. That’s who I’m mostly seeing: patients who haven’t been in the hospital but continue to have ongoing symptoms. In the BMJ article that just was published, they’re saying that 10% of patients who test positive remain unwell after three weeks. Their definition is if you have symptoms more than three weeks, you’re going into the long haulers. A lot of people are calling long haulers a month out. My colleague and I are presenting to our leadership — he’s a cardiologist, and I’m a pulmonologist — but we’re the ones who are aware of these cases two, three, four, or five months later. The fatigue and the memory issues. Depression. There’s a lot of non-pulmonary issues. Muscle aches. Anxiety. Everybody’s anxious in the day of COVID, right? Everybody’s stressed. Everybody’s had to adjust and learn. Primary care’s going to be addressing more and more of this. And our psychiatric services are going to be seeing this. My long haulers, most of them are on oxygen, and they all have pulmonary symptoms. But every time I see them, they’re a little bit better. I do see improvement over time. I will say that things such as prolonged symptoms — fatigue, that kind of thing — has been reported in MERS and SARS. MarketWatch: It’s not just a respiratory illness. Harris: Right. It’s a blood vessel illness. It’s a brain illness. It’s a muscle illness. MarketWatch: You’ve done some research around vaping and smoking. How do you talk to patients about these types of things in the context of COVID? Harris: It’s pretty well established that vaping nicotine does weaken the immune system. It especially affects how the nose can fight viruses. And how does COVID get in the system? Eyes, nose, mouth, right? You saw more cases of EVALI (e-cigarette, or vaping, product use associated lung injury) in April and May. A lot of the EVALI, like 90% to 95%, is due to the tainted THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) oil. [THC is the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis that makes people feel “high.”] I think people are going to THC with the stress of all the quarantines and all the changes. It makes sense people are reaching for that. Whatever you do, don’t vape the THC. This Q&A has been edited for clarity and length. • Dr. Osterholm: Americans will be living with the coronavirus for decades The number of confirmed cases of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 worldwide edged closer to 26 million on Wednesday, as experts sounded the alarm on the Trump administration’s decision not to work with an international effort to develop and distribute a COVID-19 vaccine that is backed by the World Health Organization.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-what-to-know-about-abbotts-15-minute-covid-19-test-11598982464?mod=home-page",
    "text": "On Aug. 26, the Food and Drug Administration granted an Emergency Use Authorization to a new rapid antigen test for COVID-19 called the BinaxNOW test. I study public health policy to combat infectious disease epidemics. Testing is one of the most powerful tools available to fight the spread of COVID-19. The new test is inexpensive, rapid and easy to use. It will massively scale up access to testing, but hurdles remain in achieving widespread, frequent COVID-19 testing. The credit-card-sized test is an antigen test that detects a specific viral protein from SARS-CoV-2. It costs $5 and doesn’t require a lab or a machine for processing. Performing the test is simple. A health-care worker or technician would use a swab to collect a sample from less than 1 inch inside the nostril. They would then combine the sample with a few drops of chemicals inside the test card. Within 15 minutes, the test strip would show a positive or negative result. The test is also paired with an app that produces a digital code that can be scanned to show proof of a recent negative COVID-19 test. The BinaxNOW test is currently only authorized for patients who have had COVID-19 symptoms for seven days or less, which is when virus levels in the body are likely to be high. It must be prescribed by a physician and performed by a trained technicianor other health-care worker. The PCR test for COVID-19 is currently widely used and considered the gold standard, but requires patient samples to be sent to a lab and can take days to provide results. The new antigen test is designed to be a cheap and quick alternative to PCR testing for diagnostic purposes in a medical setting. It would add critical capacity to an overstretched testing system. The emergency use authorization provides preliminary authorization for doctors to prescribe the antigen test while the full FDA approval process is ongoing. The authorization could be revoked if the test is not as accurate or reliable as expected. However, the true accuracy could be lower because the performance testing group was only 102 people and the accuracy hasn’t been validated by the FDA as part of the full approval process. There will inevitably be some false negatives and false positives with the BinaxNOW test since accuracy isn’t 100%, but the FDA will monitor the data to make sure the test meets the reported accuracy. The BinaxNOW test is cheap, rapid, able to be mass-produced and easy to use outside a lab. This makes it a promising candidate for widespread screening. However, the test is currently only authorized for people with COVID-19 symptoms. This is an obstacle because an estimated 40% of all COVID-19 cases are asymptomatic and these people likely don’t know that they’re contagious. To maximize the effectiveness of any COVID-19 screening program, it is important to test people whether they have symptoms or not. Health-care providers are able to prescribe the BinaxNOW test for asymptomatic patients for off-label use, but health officials don’t yet know how accurate the test is when performed on asymptomatic people. The massive expansion of testing access made possible by the BinaxNOW test will almost surely outweigh the downsides of a small number of inaccurate results. Abbott plans to manufacture 50 million tests per month starting in October. This will quickly exceed the 76 million COVID-19 tests the U.S. has performed over the last six months. Widespread, frequent testing is effective at slowing the spread of the coronavirus. The new testing capacity made possible by the authorization of this rapid antigen test represents a major advance in bringing the pandemic under control. Zoë McLaren is an associate professor of public policy at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. This was first published by The Conversation — “Will the new 15-minute COVID-19 test solve US testing problems?“ Shares of Nvidia Corp.  are up more than 3% in Wednesday morning trading after Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya upped his price objective on the stock to $650 from $600. The new target is higher than all those listed for Nvidia on FactSet. Arya is feeling more enthusiastic about Nvidia after the company priced its new Ampere card more competitively than he anticipated, a move that could drive upgrades among three quarters of the company's base using Pascal or older-generation technology, in his view. \"We believe Ampere adds the performance boost (4K at 60 frames/second) both for traditional AND ray-traced games even on traditional games that Turing often compromised on, leading some Pascal gamers to forgo the Turing upgrade,\" Arya wrote, while maintaining a buy rating on the stock. Arya joined at least five other analysts in boosting his price target on Nvidia shares after the company's Ampere announcements Tuesday.

    "text": "The stock (ticker: CPI.UK) has declined from a 2015 high of 1,294 pence to 30 pence (40 cents) after a series of government contracts disappointed and profit margins were squeezed. Shares are down almost 82% this year. The company, which manages the tax levied on drivers taking their car into a specific central London zone, and is involved with recruitment for the British army, and offers business and consulting services, is weighed down by a 1.1 billion pounds sterling ($1.45 billion) debt pile that dwarfs its £524 million market value. Forget earnings and dividends—investors are more focused on whether Capita will make it through the second half without breaching banking covenants—agreements made with banks over the terms of loans. “Capita continues to look uphill in its recovery; meeting banking covenant is set to remain tight in the short term,” wrote Robin Speakman, an analyst with broker Shore Capital, in a note. “Assessing shareholder value remains challenging, in our view; we expect Capita to survive and this should deliver material value.” There are other glimmers of hope. Capita is seeking to sell its Education Software Solutions, or ESS, unit for £500 million. The company also said in its half-year update that it won £770 million of new business. In a statement to Barron’s, CEO Jon Lewis says, “The market is clearly challenging, but we are continuing to win new business and deliver for our existing clients as we build a more focused and sustainable business for the long term.” Capita has “accelerated some strategic decisions,” including the sale of Education Software. “This prospective divestment, alongside other planned disposals, will help us to strengthen our balance sheet and deliver on our long-term aim of generating sustainable revenue growth and cash flows,” Lewis says. Brave investors could see this as a buying opportunity, with Jefferies marking Capita stock a Buy and estimating that it could rise 250%, to 105 pence. Broker Numis sees the price rising to 80 pence. The business fetches four times this year’s expected earnings and is valued at an 80% discount to its peers. Capita employs 61,000 workers, and at the full-year update in March, it posted a loss of £62.6 million for the year to Dec. 31, swinging from a £272.6 million pretax profit the year before. Revenues in 2019 were £3.6 billion. At the August half-year update, profits were worse than expected due to coronavirus. In 1984, Capita was created as part of a unit within the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy. Its first CEO, Rod Aldridge, led a management buyout in 1987. Lewis was drafted to the turn business around in 2017. The business is selling some of its crown jewels to prop up its finances, and Capita is a key partner in a number of United Kingdom government contracts. Some think that it’s too strategically important to fail. Capita provides some bespoke services that are difficult for customers to replicate themselves, but this isn’t a good time in general for support companies, as customers tighten their belts to ride out the crisis. Lewis says that Capita has made “good progress with our transformation,” and that it has managed its way through the Covid-19 crisis. Yet the business is having to adapt its revival plan to incorporate measures to withstand the pandemic. If anyone needs support services, it’s Capita. The stock may be one for the brave.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/rocket-stock-is-falling-after-the-company-reported-earnings-heres-why-51599079245?mod=home-page",
    "text": "The company reported net revenue of $5 billion, net income of $3.5 billion, and adjusted Ebitda, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, of $3.8 billion in its first earnings report as a public company after the bell Wednesday. “While I’m proud of our performance, I am even more encouraged by the significant opportunity that remains in front of us as we continue to execute on our plan of achieving 25 percent market share by 2030,” Rocket CEO Jay Farner said in a press release. “It is clear that our simple, client-focused, digital approach is continuously and fundamentally disrupting the way our industries do business.” The top-level figures reported today shouldn’t surprise investors. Rocket reported identical numbers in its preliminary results in mid-August as part of a disclosure to bondholders. The second-quarter earnings report issued today, however, is more detailed and sets guidance for the third quarter. For the second quarter of 2020, the company said it generated closed loan origination volume of $72.3 billion, a record for the company, and net rate lock volume of $92 billion, figures that are respectively 126% and 170% higher than they were in the same quarter last year. It also reported a gain-on-sale margin of 5.19%, spurred by industry-wide capacity constraints amid a high level of demand, Farner said on a conference call with investors. “Second quarter gain on sale margins were certainly elevated by historical standards,” he said. “This is exactly the kind of market environment we built our platform to perform in.” The company said it expects some those figures to grow even further quarter over quarter. Rocket expects net rate lock volume between $93 billion and $98 billion and closed loan volume between $82 billion and $85 billion in the third quarter of 2020. The company expects gain-on-sale margins between 4.05% and 4.30%, lower than this quarter, but 23% to 31% higher than the same quarter in 2019, the company said in its earnings release. “As we look to the second half of the year, we continue to see strength and durability in consumer sentiment, record low interest rates, and an improving U.S. real estate market continue to drive demand for home loans,” Farner said on the call. While Rocket expects volume to increase in the third quarter, the company’s executives reminded investors that the business typically follows the seasonal patterns of the U.S. real estate market. “While we’re happy to provide some guidance for Q3, really we typically do see that decrease in the fourth quarter,” said Rocket CFO Julie Booth. “I don’t think we’re expecting necessarily anything unusual this year, other than what we typically see, but of course that could always change.” The company also discussed potential uses for excess capital, indicating that dividends, buybacks and acquisitions could be in the future. “As a private company, we’ve historically done special dividends over the course of time,” Farner said on the call. “An acquisition is something that we think about as a use for the currency as well, and of course repurchase, if we think that that makes sense.” Rocket shares were trading down about 7.1% to $29.06 in after-hours trading Wednesday.

The Dow was up 0.8% at 11:30 a.m. Wednesday and trading was quiet. It started moving higher from there, slowly at first until accelerating, and was up more than 500 points before a small pullback. There was no real explanation for the stock market’s move. Investors shrugged off poor ADP jobs data and seemed unresponsive to better industrial-production numbers. Ultimately, it just wanted to go higher. For one day at least, the market action seemed to imply that the craziness that had inhabited the Nasdaq had found its way to the rest of the market. “What we’re seeing the first two days of September is FOMO spreading beyond the Nasdaq,” says Julian Emanuel, chief equity and derivatives strategist at BTIG, referring to the fear of missing out. Warning signs abound. NatAlliance Securities’ Brenner agrees. “This has gone a lot further than I thought it would,” he says. “And it will correct more than I think it probably should.” Consider that a warning.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/teslas-stock-sinks-into-correction-territory-after-disclosure-of-another-large-seller-2020-09-02?mod=home-page",
    "text": "Shares of Tesla Inc. took another dive Wednesday to kick off a correction, after the electric vehicle maker disclosed that one of its largest shareholders sold off a chunk of stock, although the sale was effectively just a rebalancing as the value of the stake has actually increased. What may be unnerving investors is the disclosure comes a day after the company itself said it would sell up to $5 billion worth of its stock. Separately, although BofA Securities analyst John Murphy raised his price target to imply a near-30% gain from current levels, he stopped short of recommending investors buy the stock. Many on Wall Street label a decline of at least 10% to up to 20% from a significant peak as a correction, while a decline of 20% or more is defined as a bear market. Wednesday’s close below $448.49 makes the correction “official;” a close above Monday’s record would wipe away the correction label. Also read: Only 19% of Tesla analysts say buy the stock while investors remain ‘insatiable.’ Tesla disclosed in an SC-13G/A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that Scotland-based Baillie Gifford & Co. had reduced its stake to 39.63 million shares, or 4.25%. That would drop the 112-year-old investment firm to fourth on the list of Tesla’s largest shareholders. Baillie Gifford had previously disclosed a stake of 58.86 million shares as of June 30, or 6.32% of the shares outstanding according to FactSet. That made Baillie the second-largest shareholder, behind only Chief Executive Elon Musk’s 18.3% stake. Based on Tuesday’s stock closing price of $475.05, the approximately 19.23 million shares Baillie Gifford sold would be valued at about $9.14 billion. Baillie Gifford said it sold the stock to meet internal guidelines that limit the percentage of the portfolio that could be invested in a single stock, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal. As of June 30, Baillie’s Tesla stake was valued at about $12.7 billion. As of Tuesday’s closing price, which was 120% above the June 30 closing price of $215.96, the value of the decreased stake increased by 48% to $18.8 billion. Baillie said it remains optimistic about Tesla’s future, and would buy the stock again if its sold off, the WSJ report said. BofA’s Murphy raised his stock price target to $550, which implies a 23% gain from current levels, from $350, citing the logic of the EV maker’s bulls that a rising stock price begets a rising stock price. Meanwhile, Murphy reiterated the neutral rating he’s had on the stock since Aug. 14, which reflects his skepticism around fundamentals and opportunities for the company. Murphy said Tesla’s stock-sale announcement on Tuesday corroborated his view that Tesla will take advantage of the rally to raise “low-cost equity capital” to fund accelerated growth. “It is important to recognize that the higher the upward spiral of [Tesla’s] stock goes, the cheaper capital becomes to fund growth, which is then rewarded by investors with a higher stock price,” Murphy wrote in a note to clients. He cautioned, however, that the inverse of that logic is also true, so that the lower the stock goes, the lower the stock could go. Murphy said it is this “self-fulfilling framework” that appears to explain the extreme moves in the stock, to both the upside and downside. Apple Inc.’s stock price will appear quite a bit lower Monday morning, but investors shouldn’t fret. Tomi Kilgore is MarketWatch's deputy investing and corporate news editor and is based in New York.

    "title": "My father left me money for a house — and my husband put his name on the deed. How do I ensure it goes to our kids?",
    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/my-father-left-me-money-for-a-house-and-my-husband-put-his-name-on-the-deed-how-do-i-ensure-it-goes-to-our-kids-2020-09-02?mod=home-page",
    "text": "I have been married to my husband for 38 years and we have three children together. When his mother passed away, he received an inheritance of $8,000. My husband never told me about this money, and he spent all of it before I found out he even received his inheritance. When my father passed away, he intended that any inheritance we received would be kept in his own family, so naturally my inheritance was made out to me and me alone. I deposited the money into a checking account with just my name on it. The Moneyist: ‘A man cave on wheels’: My husband’s RV is his pride and joy — but he owes $75,000 on it. If he dies, am I liable? Within 30 days of receiving my inheritance, I purchased a home with the proceeds, and my husband talked me into putting his name on the deed. The check given to the seller’s attorney was a cashier’s check with my name alone. If I die before my husband, is it possible to put the house into a living trust given that my father’s intent was to keep the money within the family, and not my married husband’s family? I want this home to be an inheritance for our children, and I don’t want him to sell it as soon as I die. I wish to make sure that he doesn’t sell it or rent it out in his lifetime. I would like him to live there until he dies. He has paid for a couple of renovations to the home. How would I go about making sure that my kids will have this home as an inheritance, assuming I predecease my husband? A.G. Dear A.G., What’s his is his — and what’s yours belongs to both of you. What happens to your property if you predecease your husband, which is obviously not a given, depends on the kind of ownership you share. If you have “tenancy by entirety” or “joint tenancy with right of survivorship” then your husband will inherit your half of the home. If you have “tenancy in common,” then you will be able to bequest your half to someone else, in this case your kids. If you had bought this property alone with the money you inherited from your father, it’s typically deemed separate property in a community-property state (Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin). Inheritance is usually separate property. But if you use marital funds to improve the property, it becomes community or marital property. The Moneyist: My mother’s will says her boyfriend can live in her home after she dies. Can I still kick him out if the deed is transferred to me? But it’s different in separate-property states in most cases where there are no extenuating circumstances. “In a separate property state, one spouse can hold property without having the other spouse on title, and the other spouse would not have any right to that property,” says Kimberly Hanlon, co-founder of Lucere Legal in Minneapolis. “In the case of a divorce, the court will sometimes look at the proportionate share of contribution when determining how to split up the asset, in which case her contribution in the initial purchase would be weighed against his contribution in the improvements,” she adds. Probate court also considers whether it’s a separate asset, joint asset, and a prenuptial agreement can change it again. The Moneyist:My husband and I are worth $3.7 million, but I’m afraid I’ll spend my way into the poor house if he dies. When I was single, I bounced checks. What can I do? In some separate-property states, the surviving spouse has statutory rights to a certain percentage of their deceased spouse’s estate and/or rights in the marital homestead, Hanlon says. “Minnesota is like that. However, the surviving spouse may consent to waive those rights, either in advance — while their spouse still lives — or after the death.” You don’t say where you live, but your husband seemed to know what he was doing: not putting his name on the deed and using marital funds to renovate the home. The good news is the opposite is also true if he predeceases you. But let’s hope that doesn’t happen and you have many more than your 38 years left. If you do receive another inheritance, don’t let anyone talk you into anything.

    "text": "Nancy Pelosi is blaming a San Francisco salon for making her look bad. The House Speaker was widely criticized on Wednesday after security footage aired by Fox News showed her getting her hair shampooed and blown out at the eSalon on Monday, even though Bay Area salons were still closed over coronavirus concerns. Hair salons were only just allowed to reopen in a limited capacity on Tuesday — and just for outdoor hairstyling services that don’t include shampooing, at that. The video clip showed Pelosi, who has pushed for wearing face masks in public during the pandemic, walking around the salon with her own mask down around her neck. Her stylist is shown wearing a mask on her face, however. Salon owner Erica Kious told Fox News that her beauty parlor rents out chairs to independent stylists, and one of these contractors told Kious she was doing Pelosi’s hair on Monday. “I was like, are you kidding me right now? Do I let this happen? What do I do?” Kious told the news program. She said Pelosi’s unexpected appointment was “a slap in the face” that “she feels that she can just go and get her stuff done while no one else can go in, and I can’t work.” Pelosi’s spokesman Drew Hammill responded in a statement that, “This business offered for the Speaker to come in on Monday and told her they were allowed by the city to have one customer at a time in the business. The Speaker complied with the rules as presented to her by this establishment.” Now Pelosi is demanding an apology from the salon, calling the whole thing a “setup” during a press conference addressing the matter on Wednesday afternoon. “I take responsibility for trusting the word of the neighborhood salon that I’ve been to over the years many times, and when they said, ‘We’re able to accommodate people one person at a time,’ I trusted that,” she said at an event about school reopenings covered by the San Francisco Chronicle. “It was a setup, and I take responsibility for falling for a setup.” Pelosi said that her mask was pulled down in the security footage because she had just had her hair washed. “I don’t wear a mask when I’m washing my hair. Do you wear a mask when you’re washing your hair? I always wear a mask,” she said. “The Beauty Parlor owner must really dislike Crazy Nancy Pelosi. Turning her in, on tape, is a really big deal,” he continued in a second missive. And Republican National Committee spokesperson Liz Harrington emailed reporters to note that salon owners who have opened their business against local laws have been jailed. “You can’t get your hair done, eat inside at a restaurant, travel, attend a funeral, or protest without mandatory quarantining. But Democrats can,” she wrote. “This isn’t about health or science. It’s about power. Democrats want to rule your life. But don’t expect their rules to apply to them.” The #SalonGate was all that reporters wanted to ask Pelosi about during her school presser on Wednesday, much to the speaker’s chagrin. “We have to get this country moving again, and I will not let this subject take away from the fact that we have 185,000 plus people who have died from this virus,” Pelosi said. Chris Wallace, the anchor of \"Fox News Sunday\" and a frequent target of Twitter barbs from President Donald Trump, will moderate the first presidential debate on Sept. 29, the Commission on Presidential Debates announced Wednesday. The second debate between Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden is scheduled for Oct. 15 and will be moderated by C-Span's political editor Steve Scully, and the third faceoff will be held Oct. 22 and moderated by NBC News White House correspondent Kristen Welker, the commission said. USA Today Washington bureau chief Susan Page will moderate the sole vice-presidential debate between Mike Pence and Kamala Harris on Oct. 7. Copyright © 2020 MarketWatch, Inc. All rights reserved."

    "text": "Health experts are learning that recovering from the coronavirus takes time. In fact, a new study of roughly 4,500 Italian COVID-19 patients published on Wednesday evening found that it takes 30 days on average for SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes the COVID-19 infection, to leave the body after the first positive test result. It takes 36 days on average for the virus to clear the body after a person starts showing symptoms. And it can linger even longer in older patients and in those with more severe illness, according to the peer-reviewed manuscript published in the online journal BMJ Open. While it’s not clear from just this observational report whether someone is still infectious during this 30-or-so-day window, the authors recommend that patients testing positive for COVID-19 get tested again in four or more weeks after their symptoms first appear in order to minimize the risk of spreading the virus. Indeed, the long-term effects of COVID-19 are only just beginning to come to light, roughly half a year into the pandemic. Some “long hauler” coronavirus patients have continued to suffer symptoms and coronavirus-related health issues for months after their initial infections, including shortness of breath, extreme muscle weakness and fatigue, and brain fog. The CDC has warned that one in five previously healthy young adults weren’t back to their usual health 14 to 21 days after testing positive. And another study found more than half (55%) of coronavirus patients still had neurological problems three months later. What’s more, this new BMJ Open report also found that the rate of false negative test results appeared to be high early in the coronavirus patients’ recovery. The study subjects were tested 15 days after their first positive swabs, 14 days after their second swabs, and nine days after their third. Those who tested negative were tested again — and the negative results were only confirmed in 79% of those cases, suggesting a rate of one false negative out of every five negative test results. The authors fear that the high rate of false negatives, plus the evidence that the virus remains in the body for more than a month, puts COVID-19 patients at risk of “unwittingly passing on the infection” as they return to work or school believing that they are all better. But the current guidance from the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that most COVID-19 patients are indeed in the clear after isolating themselves for 10 to 13 days. And those with mild to moderate illness, whose symptoms have resolved, can then leave quarantine without even getting tested for COVID-19 again. The CDC did not immediately respond to a MarketWatch request for comment about whether it has considered extending the length of time that COVID-19 patients should isolate themselves, or whether testing guidelines should be adjusted. The WHO notes that while some research has suggested that patients whose symptoms have resolved may indeed still test positive for COVID-19 for many weeks afterward, “these patients are not likely to be infectious and therefore are unlikely to be able to transmit the virus to another person.” That’s because the amount of virus a person is carrying, or their viral load, may be too low for that person to be contagious. In fact, a recent New York Times analysis suggests that many people getting diagnosed with COVID-19 could be carrying “relatively insignificant amounts” of the virus, which means that they are probably not contagious. This is because the most widely used diagnostic COVID-19 tests are PCR tests that detect the presence of the virus’ genetic material in the body. And these sensitive diagnostics can flag not only live virus samples in the body, but also genetic fragments left over from an earlier infection. (These traces are kind of like how strands of a person’s hair or skin cells can be found in a room after the person is long gone.) That’s not to say these standard diagnostic tests should be thrown out the window for being too sensitive, however. The Food and Drug Administration told the Times that when people are first infected with COVID-19, for example, they may also carry a low viral load. And tests that are less sensitive could miss these cases. The CDC also notes that someone could test negative for COVID-19 early in their infection. Research suggests that the most contagious window for COVID-19 tends to be between one to three days before someone shows symptoms (with the highest viral loads on the day someone becomes symptomatic), up until about five days afterward, according to the World Health Organization. And this level of contagiousness appears to be one to two weeks for asymptomatic persons, and up to three weeks or more for patients with mild to moderate disease. The bottom line: This is still a new virus, and health experts are still learning about how it spreads. People may be carrying the virus in their bodies longer than researchers first suspected, but it’s unclear exactly how long they will be contagious. A new study published in JAMA Pediatrics suggests that children, including asymptomatic ones, may shed the virus for weeks. So what should people take from the latest research? They should keep practicing key social-distancing measures, monitoring for symptoms, and they should get tested if they start showing symptoms or suspect that they have been exposed. Even those who test negative — either because they haven’t been exposed to the virus, or because they have recovered from it — should continue taking steps to protect themselves and those around them. This includes: washing their hands often; avoiding close contact with people outside of their household by staying at least six feet apart; and covering their nose and mouth with a face mask around others, even if they don’t feel sick. There were 25.8 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide as of Wednesday afternoon, according to the Johns Hopkins data, and at least 857,877 people have died. More than 17 million people are confirmed to have tested positive and recovered. Follow more of MarketWatch’s coronavirus coverage here.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/trump-suggests-north-carolina-residents-vote-twice-which-is-illegal-2020-09-02?mod=home-page",
    "text": "President Donald Trump on Wednesday suggested North Carolina residents should try to vote twice — by mail and in person — in the November election, seemingly encouraging them to attempt to commit voter fraud in an effort to test the state’s mail-in voting system. Trump made the comments during an interview with WECT News of Wilmington, N.C., when a reporter asked if he’s confident in the state’s voting system, which could see 600,000 absentee votes cast this fall. “They will vote and then they are going to have to check their vote by going to the poll and voting that way because if it tabulates, then they won’t be able to do that,” Trump said. “So let them send it in, and let them go vote. And if their system is as good as they say it is, then obviously they won’t be able to vote. If it isn’t tabulated, they will be able to vote. So that’s the way it is, and that’s what they should do.” Voting twice is illegal under both North Carolina and federal law. In North Carolina, it is also illegal “to induce” someone else to fraudulently cast a ballot. Trump has been a frequent and vocal critic of mail-in voting, claiming — without evidence — that it is susceptible to fraud. Trump himself has voted by mail a number of times. WECT said the way North Carolina’s system is set up, it is “clerically impossible for a person to vote twice,” because once the mail-in ballot is received, the voter would not be allowed to cast a vote in person. When asked about Trump’s suggestion Wednesday night on CNN, U.S. Attorney General William Barr said Trump was “trying to make a point,” but declined to say whether voting twice is illegal (it unequivocally is), telling host Wolf Blitzer “I don’t know what the law in the particular state says.” Separately, federal prosecutors in North Carolina charged 19 non-citizens with voter fraud Wednesday, accusing them of illegally casting ballots in 2016. Few details were disclosed, but one defendant’s attorney told the Associated Press: “These cases are clearly timed for partisan political purposes.” Do masks really work? Ask the dozens of Starbucks customers who tested positive for COVID-19 in Seoul earlier this month after a woman with coronavirus sat under an air-conditioner in the cafe.

    "text": "Asian stock markets rose Thursday after Wall Street turned in its biggest daily gain since July despite uncertainty about the global outlook. Wall Street’s benchmark S&P 500 index gained 1.5% on Wednesday after a report on hiring that some analyst said might indicate the U.S. job market recovery could be fading. Investors have been encouraged by central bank infusions of credit into struggling economies and hopes for a vaccine to end the coronavirus pandemic that has plunged the world into its deepest slump since the 1930s. Forecasters warn the stock market recovery might be running too far ahead of economic activity as the United States and some other countries reimpose anti-virus controls that hamper business. “The irony of market exuberance is rich,” said Mizuho Bank in a report. “Record highs on Wall St make a mockery of policymakers grasping for recourse to the worst downturn in decades.” U.S. stocks have gained despite lack of agreement in Congress on a new economic aid package with additional unemployment benefits to support consumer spending. A report Wednesday by payroll processor ADP, widely watched as a forerunner of government employment data due out Friday, showed the private sector added 428,000 jobs in August, less than half the 1 million expected by forecasters. Analysts said that could be a warning sign the job market is cooling after some U.S. states reimposed anti-virus controls and the expiration of supplemental unemployment benefits cut into consumer spending. “Bullish stock market sentiment seems to be nearing a tentative peak as the labor market recovery stalls,” Edward Moya of Oanda said in a report. Also Wednesday, the U.S. Federal Reserve said its August survey of businesses found enduring uncertainty over the pandemic and the harm it causes to consumer and business activity. Health care and communications stocks also helped to drive Wednesday’s rally. On the heels of a huge month for stocks in August, our call of the day says investors need to get ready for at least two pullbacks this year, with history as a guide.

    "text": "“The Dow Jones Industrial Average just closed above 29,000! You are so lucky to have me as your President,” wrote Trump in an emoji-laced tweet moments after the blue-chip benchmark booked its highest close since February, finishing within 2% of its Feb. 12 all-time closing high at 29,551.42. Wednesday’s equity-market climb underscored an unparalleled run-up in stocks from out of the depths of the coronavirus crisis back in March. Trump, arguably, more than any other modern president has hitched his political success to that of the economy, or at least the stock market, which were both leveled in the wake of the deadly public health crisis that emerged due to the spread of COVID-19 across the globe. Trump views his perception as a business-friendly commander-in-chief gives him an edge over Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, who currently leads the incumbent president in most national polls. The 45th president’s Wednesday tweet on stocks claimed that “Hiden’,” as he referred to the former Vice President Biden, would “crash” the markets, reiterating a persistent claim by Trump, as the race for the White House has heated up. Trump has cast his battle against Biden as a fight for the future of the U.S. economy. Still, the success of the stock market and economy won’t likely to be enough to secure a win for Trump. Strategists at JPMorgan Chase & Co. have made the case that a win for Biden would be “neutral to slight positive” for stocks.

    "text": "U.S. equity benchmark indexes closed in record territory Wednesday, as investors drew hope from progress in the development of tests and vaccines for COVID-19. Investors largely ignored a mixed batch of economic reports, including a private-sector jobs reading that came in weaker than expected, suggesting only a slow recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. On Tuesday, the Dow rose 215.61 points to end at 28,645.66, or 0.8% higher, the S&P 500 index  added 26.34 points to close at a record 3,526.65, a gain of 0.8%, after setting an intraday record of 3,528.03; while the Nasdaq Composite Index advanced 165.21 points to a record 11,939.67 finish, a rise of 1.1%, after touching a new intraday all-time high of 11,945.72. Stock markets finished at fresh records Wednesday, with a number of possible catalysts boosting the investing mood amid the coronavirus pandemic. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin  restarted talks with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi about another fiscal stimulus plan to help out-of-work Americans, although Pelosi said the two sides still have “serious differences,” following their brief phone call Tuesday. On the health front, leading infectious disease health expert Dr. Anthony Fauci told NBC’s “Today” show that a COVID-19 pandemic cure could come by the end of 2020, if the roster of companies attempting to achieve a vaccine are able to produce outstanding preliminary results. Speaking to Kaiser Health News on Tuesday, Fauci said the board overseeing vaccine approvals could decide that “the data is so good right now that you can say it’s safe and effective.” The global tally for confirmed cases of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 climbed to near 26 million on Wednesday, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University, while the death toll rose to 858,661. Buying continued in large-capitalization technology stocks and shares tied to pandemic stay-at-home trends, but also in shares of makers of consumer goods and autos. “The unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus, not only in the U.S., but around the world, is going to provide the economy with a bridge,” said Chris Armbruster, a portfolio manager at Kayne Anderson Rudnick in Los Angeles, giving investors reason to look beyond recently depressed economic data and high unemployment, to what lies ahead. In that vein, the U.S. government also will end up running its biggest budget shortfall ever this year, at $3.311 trillion, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said Wednesday. Still, Armbruster sees many companies forced by the pandemic to adopt technologies and make improvements to their supply chains as likely to “grow and recover faster, and realize better margins.” “It’s a pretty substantial miss, but still much better than what we saw last month,” said Mike Loewengart, managing director investment strategy at E-Trade Financial, via email. ADP did, however, raise last month’s jobs figure  to 212,000 for July from  a  rise of 167,000, which was then below forecast of 1.9 million jobs. The economy has recouped fewer than half of the 20-million-plus jobs lost in the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic. Separately, U.S. factory orders rose 6.4% in July for a third straight increase, reflecting a rebound in manufacturing after the economy reopened. Economists polled by MarketWatch had forecast a 6.2% gain. The Federal Reserve’s Beige Book survey also showed the U.S. economy expanded modestly in August, but with many parts of the country experiencing slower growth during the pandemic, including as some companies make temporary layoffs permanent. In other news, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention late Tuesday implemented a temporary eviction moratorium through the end of the year, protecting millions of U.S. renters from losing their homes during the COVID-19 pandemic. “Certainly, the real estate sector continues to be one that very few investors think will emerge in good shape,” said Cameron Brandt, director of research at EPFR, in an interview with MarketWatch. However, Brandt also sees improvements in the cards for a broader base of stocks, beyond the stay-at-home winners and technology giants, as the general population becomes more comfortable with the idea that COVID-19 can be a managed risk. “People want to get on with their lives,” he said, adding that basic restocking, differed consumption and other factors that go along with reopening “will provide modest surprises to the upside.” The major market indexes keep going up, but the notion that the stock market might be too frothy for its own good continues to be downplayed.

The $390 jump means Murphy thinks Tesla is worth $360 billion more than he did less than three weeks ago. What’s more, $550 is now the highest price target on Wall Street for Tesla shares among major brokerages, eclipsing the $500 target price of Jefferies analyst Philippe Houchois. Even though Murphy maintained his Hold rating, the change is remarkable. So is his reasoning. “[Tesla] stock is driven by growth afforded by valuation,” Murphy wrote in a Wednesday research report. “[A] High stock price begets more equity funding begets more growth.” What Murphy is saying, essentially, is that the higher Tesla stock goes, the more equity the company can raise to build plants and make more cars which, in turn, makes the stock more valuable. It's a virtuous cycle. Sort of. Taken to its logical extreme, if Tesla shares go high enough, the company can raise enough equity to dominate car production globally. But things don’t work that way in reality. First, returns on capital deployed tend to diminish over time. The larger a company gets the harder it is to maintain high returns. Second, the whole argument feels a little off. “There is a feedback loop story that can be told, where companies that see their stock prices increase may use their shares to pay employees, raise capital, and do acquisitions. For this argument to work, though, the company itself must believe that its stock is overvalued,” explains NYU Stern School of Business Professor Aswath Damodaran to Barron’s. The professor is saying, essentially, that it is good to pay for things—or buy things—with inflated currencies, such as a high-priced stock. Companies shouldn’t issue stock if it’s too cheap. In that case, companies should buy back shares. Damodaran, for his part, isn’t a Tesla bear or bull. He values the company regularly and has owned shares in the past. It is true, however, that cheaper capital is a competitive advantage, especially when an industry—such as car manufacturing—needs to spend lots of money to develop new technology, such as EV batteries, to go with future manufacturing capacity. And stock prices are a proxy on a company’s cost of equity capital. Tesla, for instance, is raising $5 billion. The company will need only about 10 million shares to raise that money, representing about 1% of total stock outstanding. At the beginning of the year, it would have needed to sell nearly 5 times as many shares. “[The equity raise] corroborates our view that [Tesla] will utilize its stock to raise low-cost equity capital to fund accelerated growth,” the analyst said. He also published a table showing how many plants Tesla could build by issuing 10% of the stock outstanding at different price points. At, say, $700 a share, Tesla could raise near $70 billion by issuing 10% of the stock outstanding, which would get it 24 new plants with 6 million cars of new capacity. That’s how Murphy’s math goes. Still, Tesla stock ultimately will be worth the amount of sustainable per-share earnings and not the number of cars delivered. As equity is raised, so does the share count. The whole argument, frankly, feels too circular. What’s more, 24 plants would take years to build and 6 million cars would still be less than 10% of the global industry. What’s also true, however, is that lower cost of capital—expressed by low interest rates—can make all stocks look cheaper. If investors want to beat bonds by, say, a couple of percentage points over time, they can pay a higher multiple of earnings when long-term rates are 1% instead of when they are 3%. Interest rates are low. The U.S. 30-year Treasury yield is near record lows at just 1.4%. As a (too) simple example, $1 of earnings is worth $23 dollars if investors want to earn 3 percentage points above the 30-year yield of 1.4%. The same $1 was worth roughly $16 two years ago when long-term Treasury yields were more than 3%. In reality, investors don’t change their discount rate as rapidly as bond yields move. Low bond yields are another facet of the cost-of-capital issue. And low rates are partly responsible for all stock gains recently, including Tesla’s epic run. Tesla shares are up about 467% year to date. Bulls and bears, however, can debate whether lower interest rates and cheap capital justify all those gains.

    "text": "There’s an old saying in poker: don’t just play the cards, play the players. It’s the same thing in markets. You can’t just focus on the cards you’re dealt, i.e., the fundamentals of this stock or that stock. You also have to focus on the other players who are playing these same cards, and that means understanding the behavior of a crowd of buyers and sellers in the stock market. Just like in poker, sometimes the cards/fundamentals don’t matter at all. Sometimes poker players will think they have an edge in understanding the other players sitting around the table, and before you know it, there’s a huge pot in the middle of the table regardless of what cards have been dealt. And, despite what I know you’ve heard, almost none of it has anything to do with people buying the stock because it’s “cheaper” since the stock split. Oh sure, we’ve all heard stories of the idiot friend of a friend who either thinks they’re getting four brand new shares of Tesla with the 5-for-one split or believes it’s more “affordable” now that it’s been split. But the truth is that fractional share purchases have been a standard feature of every retail Davey Day Trader’s online stock trading platform for months and months. If you wanted to buy $100 worth of Tesla stock, you didn’t need a stock split to make that happen (and the stock split didn’t lower the price per share to that level anyway). These stories about the idiot friend of a friend are just that — stories. They aren’t entirely apocryphal, maybe, but nowhere near even a rounding error in the average daily trading volume (more than 70 million shares a day) of Tesla stock. The feeding frenzy on Tesla has nothing to do with that handful of rubes buying the stock because it’s more “affordable” after the split. It has something to do with traders buying the stock because they believe the story that there will be rubes buying the stock because it’s more “affordable” after the split. And it has everything to do with traders buying the stock because they believe that other traders believe the story that there will be rubes buying the stock because it’s more “affordable” after the split. This is the Common Knowledge Game in action. It is the power of the crowd watching the crowd. It is the power of not what you think is true, and not what you think the crowd thinks is true, but of what the crowd thinks the crowd thinks is true. It’s an old idea in investing, dating back at least to John Maynard Keynes in the 1930s, who called it the Newspaper Beauty Contest to use as market analogy the social media of his day. Maybe we should call it the Robinhood Effect. But in both the 1930s and the 2020s, the idea is the same: in markets like these, the fundamentals don’t matter. You can play any hand you’re dealt! What matters is the story around a company or a stock, and what matters even more is whether it’s a story that everyone believes that everyone else believes. How does the game end? When you stop reading stories about the idiot friend of a friend buying “cheap” Tesla shares for the first time. Not because there were ever enough of these newbs and rubes to actually make a difference in Tesla price action, but because the story that these newbs and rubes are out there will be broken. You’ve seen exactly that happen in the past few days. Now that the stock split is over and there are no new online articles shouting “idiots who don’t understand stock splits will be buying Tesla hand over fist!”, the Common Knowledge Game breaks the other way. But you know who understands this game really well? Elon Musk. Tim Cook, too. That’s why Tesla is selling up to $5 billion worth of fresh stock while the price is so high. Think of it as the house taking their rake from the overinflated pot of money now sitting in the middle of the poker table. So don’t worry about Elon and Tim. They’ll find another story to drive another round of the Common Knowledge Game. They always do.

    "text": "Rocket Companies’ shares fell sharply in the extended session Wednesday after its first post-IPO results missed Wall Street estimates even though it swung to a profit from the year-ago period and posted record closed-loan-origination volume amid low interest rates. Shares of the parent company of mortgage-lending giant Quicken Loans fell as much as 8% in after-hours trading, after closing nearly 2% higher, to $31.31, in the regular session. The company, whose closed-loan-origination volume of $72.3 billion for the quarter represented a 126% increase from the same period a year ago, did not provide per-share figures in its earnings release. Rocket Cos. also reported net-rate lock volume of $92 billion, up 170% compared with the year-ago period. This story was updated to include Rocket’s preannouncement of second-quarter results. VirnetX Holding Corp.  received a positive court ruling Wednesday, as the  internet security software and technology company disclosed that the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas has denied Apple Inc.'s  motion for relief from a judgment in the VirnetX vs. Apple patent case. The ruling is related to the case in which VirnetX was awarded total damages of $439.7 million as Apple was found to have infringed on VirnetX's patents. In February, Apple was denied a rehearing of the case. VirnetX's stock was still inactive in premarket trading, while Apple shares gained 1.8% toward record territory. Year to date, shares of VirnetX have rallied 35.3%, Apple has run up 82.8% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average  has tacked on 0.4%.

    "text": "An earlier version of this article misstated the FactSet revenue consensus for the fiscal third quarter. It is $75.5 million. Zuora Inc. topped expectations with its fiscal second-quarter results but its shares tumbled in after-hours trading Wednesday after the company’s outlook for the current period came up light. Chief Executive Tien Tzuo told MarketWatch prior to Zuora’s earnings call that the company anticipates the COVID-19 crisis will drive a longer-term shift toward subscription business models, even if that doesn’t immediately manifest in the company’s results, given a greater interest in recurring revenue coming out of the pandemic. “Interest in subscriptions has never been higher,” he said. “It’s going to take time to translate that into customers and revenue but we’re really busy and feel good about the future.” Tzuo also said that Zuora has seen some negative impacts from the pandemic, including from travel- and hospitality-related customers, though he believes that the worst of those effects are in the past. Zuora anticipates $73 million to $75 million in revenue for the fiscal third quarter, a view that came up short of the FactSet consensus, which is looking for $75.5 million in October-quarter revenue. Zuora also expects an adjusted loss per share of 4 cents to 5 cents, while analysts surveyed by FactSet had been modeling 5 cents. Tzuo said that he’s “feeling good about the [fiscal third-quarter] outlook” and noted that the stock had “a bit of a run up this week” ahead of the report. “We’re focused on the long term,” he said. The company exceeded expectations with its fiscal second-quarter results, delivering revenue of $75 million, up from $69.7 million a year earlier, while analysts were expecting $73.5 million. After adjusting for stock-based compensation and other expenses, Zuora broke even on a per-share basis, after it posted a 9-cent adjusted loss per share a year prior. The FactSet consensus called for a 7-cent adjusted loss per share. “We’ve done a really nice job of managing expenses from the standpoint of being very judicious,” said Todd McElhatton, who recently took over as chief financial officer. He noted that Zuora has been able to eliminate costs thanks to virtual events and a lack of employee travel expenses. While some of those costs may come back when the COVID-19 situation improves, McElhatton expects that some events and meetings will stay virtual even in a more normalized world. Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc. shares  slid 8% Wednesday, after Muddy Waters said it has taken a short position in the stock, which has been boosted this year by high hopes for its COVID-19 vaccine candidate. The short selling firm, led by investor Carson Block, said in a series of tweets that a recent court decision \"makes it clear that Inovio lacks manufacturing capacity to get remotely near purported goal of 1 million doses in 2020 and 100 million in 2021.\" The decision was made in a case Inovio brought against GeneOne Life Science Inc. and VGXI Inc. over a supply agreement. Muddy Waters also noted that Citron Research, another short seller, had compared Inovio to scandal-ridden Theranos earlier this year and called it 'one of the longest running and most blatant stock promotion schemes ever witnessed.\" \"We concur,\" said Muddy Waters. Inovio makes DNA based vaccines and immunotherapies for a range of diseases, including HPV and Zika, but hasn't yet had a product approved for treatment. The company is currently conducting a Phase 1 trial of its vaccine candidate, INO-4800, and has said it expects to start Phase 2/3 trials in September. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Shares are still up 218% in the year to date. Emily Bary is a MarketWatch reporter based in New York.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-you-might-not-know-that-trump-is-threatening-your-social-security-2020-09-02?mod=home-page",
    "text": "One way U.S. voters are being played during this presidential election campaign is the deceitful manner in which key issues are being framed for their consumption. Arguably the biggest and most important of these concerns the so-called “third rail” of American politics: Social Security. President Donald Trump has vowed to kill funding for this critical, gargantuan program that nearly 70 million Americans depend on. What? You haven’t heard Trump say he wants to kill Social Security’s funding? Actually, you have. Trump says he wants to kill the payroll tax — which is how Social Security is funded. Perhaps like many Americans, you’re unaware of how Social Security is financed. It comes from payroll taxes that are paid by you and your employer. The past four years have convinced me that there are many other things that Trump’s supporters don’t seem to understand either (trade/tariffs, regulations, the stock market, etc.) but I digress. “If victorious on November 3rd,” the president said on Aug. 8th, “I plan to forgive these taxes and make permanent cuts to the payroll tax.” He then added: “I’m going to make them all permanent.” So when Trump talks of a “payroll tax cut,” you might think that sounds great. A tax cut! But this is deceptive election year politics, designed to take advantage of voter ignorance. Anyone in the media that’s going along with Trump’s framing of this as a mere tax cut is also being played. Trump seems to think that killing the payroll tax will save companies big bucks (His 2017 corporate tax cut wasn't enough?) while increasing the take home pay of American workers. Bigger take home pay? Tens of millions of Americans don’t have pay — period — thanks to the economic collapse brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. Important sidebar: Note that Trump said in late February, when the U.S. had just 15 coronavirus cases, that we would soon be down to none — proof, he said, that he was an effective leader. “When you have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that’s a pretty good job we’ve done,” Trump said at the time. Yet as of this writing, the U.S., with about 4% of the world’s population, has more than six million cases — one of every four on the planet. Not that this and other gross miscalculations and bumbling has stopped Trump from believing — and actually looking into — how he could be added to Mount Rushmore, alongside Presidents Lincoln, Washington, Jefferson and Theodore Roosevelt. It doesn’t get more delusional than this except, perhaps, for kooky Trump advisers like economist Stephen Moore, and even Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who has said that Social Security could always be paid for by moving trillions of dollars from the government’s “general fund to those trusts funds.” Trillions of dollars from the general fund?  What trillions of dollars? The federal deficit for fiscal year 2019 that ended last Sept. 30 was $984 billion. It has nearly quadrupled this year to a staggering $3.7 trillion, and this will skyrocket even further if another round of pandemic aid gets passed. These sums — so vast as to be nearly incomprehensible — get added on to the national debt, which as of last week was $26.6 trillion, up 33.6% on Trump’s watch. Remember: Trump said he would eliminate the entire national debt — not the deficit, the national debt itself — in eight years, because of all the brilliant trade deals he would do. Here we are four years later and things are worse, far worse, than ever. Other White House advisers, seeing the political damage this kind of talk has inflicted in a tough election race, have walked back plans to kill Social Security’s funding. And yet Trump’s words speak for themselves. All this loose talk is an insult to the tens of millions of Americans who are heavily dependent on Social Security (and Medicare too). “Heavily dependent” is not hyperbole. Consider some numbers: According to the Social Security Administration, the average monthly benefit for recipients this year is $1,503. As modest as this is, it represents just about everything — “90% or more” of all income received by “21% of married couples and about 45% of unmarried persons. It’s probably difficult for wealthy men like Trump, Mnuchin (who moonlights as the chief trustee of the Social Security Trust Fund) and others to see, but there is a vast sea of poverty in the United States. Click here to read a recent MarketWatch column I wrote about seniors and poverty. I’m talking about men and women — tens of millions of American workers — who paid into the system over their entire working lives. They deserve more respect than the Trump administration is showing them — and the assurance that the U.S. government will, without fail, honor the obligations it has made to them. Since Trump’s base skews older, it’s reasonable to assume that many of them, too, are overly dependent on Social Security. They, and everyone else, must understand that when the president talks about a payroll tax cut, it doesn’t mean what it seems. Those ever-lower interest rates mean that it now takes more money to purchase the same retirement standard of living. Paul Brandus is the White House bureau chief for West Wing Reports.

    "text": "When I was growing up, Social Security used to be called “the third rail of American politics,” because it threatened to kill the career of any politician who dared touch it. Not, it seems, any longer. Senators are seriously considering trying to arrange for the cutting — or gutting — of Social Security under cover of the coronavirus pandemic. This is an attack on multiple fronts. It includes proposals to suspend, or even eliminate, the payroll tax on which Social Security depends, and arranging a secret — yes, indeed — conference on Capitol Hill to find ways to “save” Social Security. Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell wants this secret conference to be a condition of agreeing any further economic rescue package. He’s already on record calling for Social Security benefits to be, er, “adjusted.” Suspending the payroll tax as a “crisis” measure won’t help people out of work. But it will apparently make it even more needed to cut benefits down the road. Oops! It will surprise no one that this attempt to violate commitments made to American savers and future retirees is apparently to be called the “Trust Act.” And my British friends always say we Americans “have no sense of irony.” This forthcoming election may decide the fate of Social Security. The president has vowed to eliminate the payroll tax if he’s re elected. Just one thing. There is no Social Security “crisis.” It is completely made up. There is no financial “crisis.” There is no economic “crisis.” The only Social Security “crisis” is the crisis of people believing there is a Social Security crisis. If anyone guts the program, or slashes benefits, they are doing so through choice, not necessity. And they are choosing to slash an absolutely vital program that keeps millions out of poverty and has functioned successfully for 80 years. Is there a problem with funding? Yes, of course there is. But it is eminently fixable without draconian measures. The most obvious is to get rid of the cap on taxable wages, so people pay the tax on everything they earn. But there are plenty of others. Others include actually investing the Social Security trust funds in stocks, like almost every other pension plan on the planet. The Social Security Administration Trustees, in their latest report, said the so-called “trust fund” will run out by 2035. The technical term for that is “insolvent.” But it’s a word being bandied around deliberately to scare people. It doesn’t mean “insolvent” in any normal meaning of the word. It just means the trust fund, which is an internal accounting technique for the federal budget, will no longer have an accounting surplus. Money out will have to depend on money coming in. The Social Security Administration says the “unfunded obligations” will equal 3% of taxable payroll. Trillions of dollars. Congressional Research Service explains that from 2035 onward, without any changes, benefits could have to be cut by 21% to balance the books. Yikes. But whenever policy wonks—or political journalists, for that matter—write about these things they seem to try to blind us all with science. Sometimes they seem to find the biggest or most abstruse or complicated data possible. (Budget and tax changes, for example, are generally discussed in terms of 10 years’ numbers, because they sound so huge.) So let’s cut through all the scary numbers around Social Security, and just focus on these two items. The first is that the average Social Security benefit is just $1,514 a month. It’s chicken feed. On this, people have to live out their golden years. Cutting this by 21% would mean slashing it to $1,200 a month. That’s the average. Imagine the humanitarian crisis in this country if that happens. And here’s the second gem, which can be found on page 16 of the latest trust fund report. The alleged funding gap, the so-called crisis, represents no more than “1.0 percent of GDP (increased from 0.9 percent in last year’s report) over the 75-year valuation period.” 1%. That’s the “crisis.” Ahem. We were able to find a spare 1% of GDP for the 2017 tax cut. We’re able to borrow several percentage points of GDP every single year to run budget deficits every year. Well, federal taxes were just 16.3% of GDP last year, according to the White House’s numbers. The average under Ronald Reagan? Over one full point higher. So we could fix this just by going back to Reagan-era tax rates. The average during Bill Clinton’s second term was a full 3 percentage points higher than today. And the economy boomed and the stock market soared. According to Statista, we’ve just found 13% of GDP just this year to pay for the pandemic and lockdowns. And apparently we are able to print that money without unleashing inflation or budget panic. Quite the reverse, actually. Long-term interest rates have collapsed. The only crisis facing Social Security is that more and more people under 65 are being convinced that the program will have to be gutted so they shouldn’t plan for it. And that lays the groundwork for the cuts. It’s a perfect circular argument. But: 15 hundred bucks a month. And 1% of GDP.

    "text": "“If Joe Biden gets elected, everyone will dump all their stocks so they won’t have to pay the higher capital gains taxes he’ll impose on investors. Get out while you can.” “If President Donald Trump is re-elected, his reckless spending and masks-off attitude toward ending the pandemic will force states to reimpose lockdowns that will put millions more Americans out of work.” With the Democratic and Republican conventions  over with, we’re heading into the home stretch of what promises to be the most unusual election in U.S. history. No matter which side of the political aisle you’re on, you’ve probably either read or heard some of the lurid doomsday predictions made by so-called market prophets. The sad thing is, these wildly inaccurate pundits spew the same hyperbole during every presidential election year. Depending who wins the office, they say, the market will either skyrocket or plummet. Yet the market almost always ignores these politically motivated prognostications. Why? Because history shows that, over the long term, market performance isn’t affected by who wins presidential elections. Instead, investors react almost exclusively to events that affect the economy in general and corporate profits in particular. Why has the market recovered? Because institutional investors — the ones that do the majority of trading on Wall Street — are expressing their views that the current recession won’t last long and that corporations will start posting higher earnings in 2021. These investors also believe that the Federal Reserve will continue to keep interest rates at historically low levels and the government will continue to spend trillions on economic stimulus programs until unemployment rates drop to “manageable” levels. These policies are unlikely to change even if Biden is elected president and the Democrats regain the Senate. The market knows this, and, absent a need to restore nationwide lockdowns, it’s likely to continue to move cautiously upward. Do you believe that newly elected Democratic presidents cause market sell-offs or that first-term Republican presidents release the bulls on Wall Street — or vice versa? History debunks that myth. Need evidence? Take a look at how the S&P 500 has performed in the first full year of a newly elected president over the past 92 years. 1929*: -11.91% 1933: 46.59% 1953:** -6.62% 1961: 23.13% 1969:** -11.36% 1977: -11.50% 1981**: -9.73% George H.W. Bush (R) succeeds Reagan (R)) 1989: 27.25% Clinton (D) succeeds G.H.W. Bush (R) 1993: 7.06% George W. Bush (R) succeeds Clinton (D) 2001**: -13.04% Obama (D) succeeds George W. Bush (R) 2009: 23.45% 2017: 9.54% Viewed solely through an electoral lens, you might assume that the markets reacted negatively to Republicans winning the presidency more often than Democrats. But this narrow thinking ignores both political and economic facts. In most cases the negative returns were the result of an economic downturn that began after the new president had settled in office. For example, the market was flying high during most of the first year of the Hoover administration until the crash of October 1929 sparked the Great Depression. What about those who say that when Democrats raise taxes wealthy investors run for the hills? That’s not supported by evidence, either. For example, in 1990 President George Bush raised taxes on the wealthiest Americans, sparking the usual fears of a market selloff. Instead, the S&P 500 delivered positive returns in eight of the following nine years. In 2012, President Barack Obama allowed President George W. Bush’s tax cuts for Americans making more than $400,000 per year to expire. Investors didn’t panic. From 2013 to 2016 the S&P 500 delivered an average annual return of 12.45%. The fact is, presidential politics and tax policies have little impact on the markets, and the stock market still tends to post positive returns over the long term. Unless you absolutely are going to need to use your invested assets for retirement income or other purposes over the next year or so, try not let your political views lead you to impulsive investment decisions that do more harm than good. If you’re convinced that the market is headed for a free-fall, there are ways to protect the value of your investments without hitting the panic button. David Frisch, a financial advisor and president of Frisch Financial Group, has received many calls from scared investors who either want to get out of the market completely or are looking for ways to limit their losses. He tries to convince them to stick to their plans, but if they’re frantic about protecting against catastrophic losses, he discusses three possible strategies they may want to consider, even though he doesn’t explicitly endorse any of them. 1. Consider boosting cash and bond allocations: Selling a certain percentage of your stocks and investing the proceeds in cash or short-term bond funds can reduce potential losses if the stock market tanks without sacrificing potential gains if it rises. But you have to make significant changes to your asset allocation for this strategy to offer any meaningful level of protection. “For example, if the investor’s portfolio is now 55% stocks and 45% cash or short-term bonds, moving to a 50/50 mix isn’t going to change their outcome all that much,” Frisch says. “And if they’re adjusting their allocation in a taxable portfolio, the amount they may have to pay in capital gains taxes when they sell stock positions may be higher than what they might have lost if the market went down.” 2. Consider buying puts for bear market protection and potential profits:  Another possible solution is to invest some of your money in put options. These hedging securities give you the right to sell an underlying stock or index (such as the S&P 500) at a predetermined price by a certain expiration date. If the index is down when you sell the put you may make a profit. If the index is higher than your put price when you sell it, your options will expire worthless but your equities may rise. “While a put won’t benefit investors when the market is rising, it’s a viable strategy for those who strongly believe that the market will fall over a defined time frame. Investing in a put can both protect the portfolio’s downside while offering the potential to make a profit should the investor’s bearish market sentiments come to fruition,” Frisch says. 3. Consider defined outcome ETFs to gain greater control over upside and downside risk: In the past few years, a new class of exchange-traded funds have emerged that are designed to help investors reduce potential losses over a predefined period. Defined outcome ETFs invest in options contracts that attempt to mirror the performance of a stock market index over a one-year period. Each ETF has a stated “buffer,” a percentage of losses an investor will be protected from if the ETF loses value, as well as a “cap,” which is the maximum return the investor will earn if the ETF’s price rises. Here’s a hypothetical example. The XYZ S&P 500 Defined Outcome ETF-September 2021 offers a 9% buffer and a 16% cap. If you buy shares at its opening price on September 1, 2020, the first day of its term, and the fund’s value is down 20% on August 31, 2021, the last day of its outcome period, your actual loss will be 11% (20%-9%). Likewise, if the ETF is up 20% on August 31, 2021, you’ll miss out on 4% of that gain. While on paper these defined outcome ETFs appear to offer investors the ability to restrict how much they can gain or lose to a particular range, in practice this isn’t necessarily so, Frisch says. “Your actual outcome will really depend on the price of the ETF when you buy it and its price either at the end of the term or if you sell it beforehand. Considering that these funds typically charge management fees of 0.80%, compared to around 0.05%-0.10% for most ETFs, they’re more expensive, but these costs may be worth paying for the protection they provide.” All that said, Frisch discourages investors from rushing into any of these protective options. “I’ll try to remind them that the S&P 500 has finished in negative territory in only 26 out of the past 90 years, and nine of those years occurred during the Great Depression,” he says. He also strongly advises investors not to try to implement any of these options on their own. Says Frisch: “Reallocating your portfolio, evaluating and buying put options and researching the many flavors of defined outcome funds requires a level of investment knowledge most people simply don’t have.” Pam Krueger is the creator and host of the MoneyTrack investor-education television series seen nationally on PBS.

    "text": "If you are an investor of any type — whether you have a 401(k), IRA, or trading account — there are a few things you could do to promote racial equity. You may have heard of ESG investing, which stands for “environmental, social and governance.” It is also often called sustainable, socially responsible or simply “values” investing. It’s an investment strategy that selects stocks and bonds based not only on traditional financial criteria, but also based on the impact of different companies on society and the environment. Proponents of ESG investing point to a growing body of evidence that suggests sustainable investing may actually improve a portfolio’s performance, while also serving the greater good. Over the past five years, sustainable funds have outperformed their conventional peers in both up and down markets, according to a Morningstar report. Also, as markets tumbled during the first quarter of 2020, almost 60% of the biggest U.S. sustainable mutual funds and exchange-traded funds lost less in market value than the S&P 500. The popularity of socially responsible investing has exploded in recent years. In early 2020, around 74% of global investors said they plan to increase their ESG allocation over the next year. In the first quarter of 2020, U.S., sustainable funds saw inflows of $10.5 billion, according to Morningstar — a more than 10-fold increase from the first quarter of 2010. And even as markets tumbled due to the coronavirus crisis, global demand for ESG proved resilient. The global sustainable-fund universe saw inflows of over $45 billion in the first quarter, while the overall fund universe saw outflows of more than $380 billion, according to Morningstar. Environmental factors often include things like carbon emissions and water usage. Social impact may involve working conditions for a company’s employees and gender or racial equity. And governance criteria often have to do with board oversight and transparency. In light of recent events, the “S” — or social — part of ESG has come into focus, as more and more people are looking at the social impact of large corporations, specifically from a racial justice standpoint. That’s where things get a little tricky. There are more than 300 funds marketed as ESG in the U.S., according to Morningstar. But there’s no official definition of “socially responsible” investing. To further complicate the issue, there are dozens of different companies that issue ESG ratings, ranging from large data providers, like MSCI and Sustainalytics, to smaller companies and even nonprofits that focus on topics like gender-pay equity and civil liberties. Unlike accounting standards, there is not one unique methodology. Some of the data is self-reported by the companies, and some of it is done by third parties, who are often estimating. There are of course some broad principles, like how the company treats its workers — but these are often hard to quantify. For example, companies can get a high score for having anti-harassment policies in place, without tracking how well the policies are actually implemented. “There are not yet clear apple-to-apple comparisons across the board even for public companies, let alone private companies,” said Andrei Cherny, CEO of Aspiration, an online “financial firm with a conscience,” which offers a variety of banking and investing products focused on environmental and social impact. Cherny has called for regulators to require public companies to report ESG-related data, such as carbon emissions, diversity of their workforce, and how they pay their employees — just like they have legal obligations to report their financial performance. “Those are factors that investors need to know just as much as they need to know the price-to-earnings ratio,” he said. Other industry leaders echo Cherny’s thoughts. For instance, in the wake of recent events, Calvert Research & Management, a prominent sustainable-investing shop, called for companies to “accurately assess their racial diversity” and make it public, provide pay equity disclosure across race and gender, and publicly state what they are doing to combat racism and police brutality. Meanwhile, some asset managers have decided to influence change from the inside. Neuberger Berman, which manages $330 billion, decided to use its shareholder status to drive governance and sustainability practices. In April 2020, the company announced that it would publicly disclose and explain the firm’s voting rationale and intentions at more than 25 key annual shareholder meetings. “Normally shareholders vote quietly behind the scenes,” said Jonathan Bailey, Head of ESG at Neuberger Berman. Instead, by providing advance vote disclosure, Neuberger Berman intends to educate investors and the public on “why we’re voting a particular way,” Bailey said. “We have a responsibility, as market participants, to take [these issues] seriously; they’re financially material issues,” Bailey said. The proposal did not end up passing, as it gathered about 30% shareholder support, according to a Neuberger Berman spokesperson. While there are currently no industry-wide standards around social impact, a few companies have launched niche products specifically targeted at race and equality. For example, OpenInvest, a company that builds indexes and other investing tools around social causes, has created an index specifically on racial justice. It screens for metrics like board member inclusion, workforce diversity and which companies pollute the most in communities of color. Similarly, Impact Shares, a nonprofit provider of exchange-traded funds, partnered with the NAACP to launch a first-of-its-kind racial empowerment ETF. But what the ESG industry has been missing is that “your social priorities may be drastically different from my social priorities,” said Ethan Powell, CEO of Impact Shares. For example, some ESG funds hold shares of liquor or gaming companies. These holdings might be a problem for some investors, but not others. Powell envisions a future where “effectively every social issue will be reflected with a separately investible fund,” so that investors can create portfolios that are reflective of their individual social priorities. Partnering with nonprofits could play a key role in the development of such products, according to Powell, because social-advocacy organizations are in a better position to understand the particular social issues at hand. What many experts agree on is that growing investor demand will inevitably push the industry to innovate. Years ago socially-responsible investing offered just a few options to cover a small piece of investors’ stock portfolios. Today, there are hundreds of different mutual and exchange-traded funds to pick from, not just in equities but also in fixed income and even junk bonds. One study showed that around $12 trillion of assets in the U.S. are managed under some sustainable investing strategy. So while you wait for the industry to establish widely-accepted standards, you could start building your own socially-responsible portfolio by looking at the ratings and methodology of different funds and companies and picking what aligns best with your values and financial goals.

    "text": "Eurozone service activity barely expanded in August, according to data released on Thursday, a sign of the halting recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. The IHS Markit eurozone services purchasing managers index registered 50.5 in August versus 54.7 in July. That is slightly above the flash reading of 50.1, and over the 50 mark indicating improving conditions. A marked slowdown of growth in France, plus returns to contraction in Italy and Spain, weighed heavily on overall service sector expansion, IHS Markit said. “The near-stalling needs to be viewed in the context of the strong expansion seen in July: business growth had surged to a near two-year high as economies opened up further from the severe COVID-19 lockdowns. However, the latest reading still sends a disappointing signal that the rebound has lost almost all momentum,” said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit. It was a different story in the U.K., which had the worst showing of the major economies in the June-ending quarter. The IHS Markit/CIPS UK Services PMI rose to 58.8 in August, up from 56.5 in July.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/trump-orders-federal-agencies-to-review-defunding-new-york-3-other-lawless-cities-2020-09-02?mod=home-page",
    "text": "WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump is ordering the federal government to begin the process of defunding New York City and three other cities where officials allowed “lawless” protests and cut police budgets amid rising violent crime, The Post can exclusively reveal. Trump on Wednesday signed a five-page memo ordering all federal agencies to send reports to the White House Office of Management and Budget that detail funds that can be redirected. New York City, Washington D.C., Seattle and Portland are initial targets as Trump makes “law and order” a centerpiece of his reelection campaign after months of unrest and violence following the May killing of George Floyd by Minnesota police. “My Administration will not allow Federal tax dollars to fund cities that allow themselves to deteriorate into lawless zones,” Trump says in the memo, which twice mentions New York Mayor Bill de Blasio by name. “To ensure that Federal funds are neither unduly wasted nor spent in a manner that directly violates our Government’s promise to protect life, liberty, and property, it is imperative that the Federal Government review the use of Federal funds by jurisdictions that permit anarchy, violence, and destruction in America’s cities.” Federal agencies must detail “all Federal funds provided to Seattle, Portland, New York City, Washington, D.C.” Also, within 14 days Attorney General Bill Barr must develop a list of “anarchist jurisdictions” that “permitted violence and the destruction of property to persist and have refused to undertake reasonable measures” to restore order. The memo does not require Barr to include the four cities, possibly for legal reasons. The memo instructs White House budget director Russ Vought to issue guidance in 30 days from Wednesday “to the heads of agencies on restricting eligibility of or otherwise disfavoring, to the maximum extent permitted by law, anarchist jurisdictions in the receipt of Federal grants.” The amounts of money impacted by Trump’s order could be massive. New York City, for example, gets about $7 billion a year in federal aid. New York is named because of a crime wave as officials cut police funds. The city had a 177 percent spike in shootings in July compared to last year. The City Council approved a budget in July that cuts $1 billion from the NYPD’s $6 billion annual budget and eliminates $537 million in capital spending. The memo says that “in New York City, city officials have allowed violence to spike.” “In light of this unconscionable rise in violence, I have offered to provide Federal law enforcement assistance, but both Mayor de Blasio and Governor Andrew Cuomo have rejected my offer,” Trump says in the memo. “While violence has surged, arrests have plummeted. In a 28-day period during the months of June and July, [New York City] arrests were down 62 percent from the same period in 2019. Amidst the rising violence, Mayor Bill de Blasio and the New York City Council agreed to cut one billion dollars from the New York Police Department (NYPD) budget, including by cancelling the hiring of 1,163 officers.” The memo also cites NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea’s June disbandment of plainclothes units. “Police officials have cited this decision as a factor contributing to the rise in violence,” the memo says. The document knocks the performance of Democratic mayors in each city, as well as state leaders. “As a result of these State and local government policies, persistent and outrageous acts of violence and destruction have continued unabated in many of America’s cities, such as Portland, Seattle, and New York,” the memo says. In Washington, DC, “Mayor Muriel Bowser allowed rioters and anarchists to engage in violence and destruction in late May and early June, requiring me to call in the National Guard to maintain law and order in the Nation’s Capital,” the memo says. The memo, in the works for weeks, does not directly reference activists confronting guests of Trump’s Republican National Convention speech as they left the White House on Thursday. Portland made the list for nightly clashes that this week included activists smashing the windows of Mayor Ted Wheeler’s condo building, launching fireworks at its windows and lighting fires both inside and outside the residence. Wheeler, who refused Trump’s offer of federal assistance in a recent letter, announced Tuesday he will find a new home to spare his neighbors from further protests. Seattle is on the list largely for tolerating a long-running “autonomous zone” that ultimately was dismantled due to violent crime including shootings nearby. “On July 1, Seattle declared the protest zone dismantled. But such failed leadership continues to harm the people of Seattle as, in recent weeks, rioters have engaged in violence and destruction of property across Seattle, resulting in at least 59 police officers being injured and multiple businesses and vehicles vandalized,” the memo says. Vought, the White House budget director, applauded the review in a statement. “American taxpayers who fund the great programs that our cities rely on deserve to be protected by their local city officials,” Vought told The Post. “We are taking action by exploring all options to ensure federal resources flowing to lawless cities aren’t being squandered. The lack of law and order surrounding these riots, and response from local leadership, is a dereliction of duty. Our men and women in blue cannot be handcuffed by local leadership in their efforts to respond to riots and protect their fellow citizens,” Vought said. A senior administration official told The Post that “taxpayers shouldn’t foot the bill for local politicians’ dereliction of duty” and “President Trump is ensuring taxpayer dollars are not wasted by lawless mayors.” The list of cities and possibly states will be updated periodically with input from the Justice Department, the official said, and federal agencies will be directed to revise grant conditions when applicable to uphold the rule of law. The official said Portland, the smallest city on the list, got more than $252 million in federal funds in fiscal 2019, including for police operations. This report originally appeared on NYPost.com.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/blowout-pelosi-says-salon-owes-her-an-apology-for-setting-me-up-2020-09-02?mod=home-page",
    "text": "Nancy Pelosi is blaming a San Francisco salon for making her look bad. The House Speaker was widely criticized on Wednesday after security footage aired by Fox News showed her getting her hair shampooed and blown out at the eSalon on Monday, even though Bay Area salons were still closed over coronavirus concerns. Hair salons were only just allowed to reopen in a limited capacity on Tuesday — and just for outdoor hairstyling services that don’t include shampooing, at that. The video clip showed Pelosi, who has pushed for wearing face masks in public during the pandemic, walking around the salon with her own mask down around her neck. Her stylist is shown wearing a mask on her face, however. Salon owner Erica Kious told Fox News that her beauty parlor rents out chairs to independent stylists, and one of these contractors told Kious she was doing Pelosi’s hair on Monday. “I was like, are you kidding me right now? Do I let this happen? What do I do?” Kious told the news program. She said Pelosi’s unexpected appointment was “a slap in the face” that “she feels that she can just go and get her stuff done while no one else can go in, and I can’t work.” Pelosi’s spokesman Drew Hammill responded in a statement that, “This business offered for the Speaker to come in on Monday and told her they were allowed by the city to have one customer at a time in the business. The Speaker complied with the rules as presented to her by this establishment.” Now Pelosi is demanding an apology from the salon, calling the whole thing a “setup” during a press conference addressing the matter on Wednesday afternoon. “I take responsibility for trusting the word of the neighborhood salon that I’ve been to over the years many times, and when they said, ‘We’re able to accommodate people one person at a time,’ I trusted that,” she said at an event about school reopenings covered by the San Francisco Chronicle. “It was a setup, and I take responsibility for falling for a setup.” Pelosi said that her mask was pulled down in the security footage because she had just had her hair washed. “I don’t wear a mask when I’m washing my hair. Do you wear a mask when you’re washing your hair? I always wear a mask,” she said. “The Beauty Parlor owner must really dislike Crazy Nancy Pelosi. Turning her in, on tape, is a really big deal,” he continued in a second missive. And Republican National Committee spokesperson Liz Harrington emailed reporters to note that salon owners who have opened their business against local laws have been jailed. “You can’t get your hair done, eat inside at a restaurant, travel, attend a funeral, or protest without mandatory quarantining. But Democrats can,” she wrote. “This isn’t about health or science. It’s about power. Democrats want to rule your life. But don’t expect their rules to apply to them.” The #SalonGate was all that reporters wanted to ask Pelosi about during her school presser on Wednesday, much to the speaker’s chagrin. “We have to get this country moving again, and I will not let this subject take away from the fact that we have 185,000 plus people who have died from this virus,” Pelosi said.

    "text": "The U.S. economy grew more slowly in August as anxiety over the coronvirus, the end of federal benefits and an increase in permanent job losses hindered the recovery, the Federal Reserve said Wednesday. • Boston: “Business contacts continued to cite the disruptive effects of the pandemic on all aspects of their activity, even as recovery began or continued in some sectors,” the Boston Federal Reserve said. The Boston Fed is one of 12 regional Fed banks scattered around the country. The information collected by the banks from businesses in their districts form the basis of the Beige Book’s conclusions. • Philadelphia: “Uncertainty is extremely high as contacts await layoffs, evictions, foreclosures, and bankruptcies while the coronavirus persists and the stimulus ends,” the Philadelphia Fed said. • Cleveland: “Some businesses have noted less trouble bringing back furloughed workers and hiring new ones in recent weeks, as unemployment benefits were scaled back,” the New York Fed. “However, a number of companies noted that concerns about child care and the upcoming school year remain constraints on worker availability.” • ”The majority of firms believed that by next spring, their staff levels would still be below pre-pandemic levels,” the Cleveland Fed said. • “Much of retail shopping remained weak, particularly at brick and mortar stores,” the Richmond Fed said. “Auto sales, on the other hand, were strong.” • Atlanta: “Some businesses rescinded salary cuts, while others maintained pay cuts, froze salaries, or eliminated bonuses and/or contributions to 401K plans,” the Atlanta Fed said. • St. Louis: “Some larger firms also reported laying off furloughed workers in the face of slower recovery,” the St. Louis Fed said. • Minneapolis: “A large professional services firm in Minneapolis-St. Paul said, “I anticipate furloughs becoming layoffs if some of our shelved work doesn’t start up,” according to the Minneapolis Fed. • Dallas: “When asked how likely it is that their business will permanently shut down within the next 12 months, 90 percent of contacts said it is not likely,” the Dallas Fed reported. Investors beware: The number of people applying for unemployment benefits could fall sharply when the government on Thursday reports  jobless claims, but it won’t necessarily mean far fewer people are losing their jobs.

    "text": "Joe Biden will visit Kenosha, Wis., on Thursday amid lingering tensions over the shooting of a Black man by a white police officer, making the trip two days after President Donald Trump toured the city. The Democratic presidential nominee’s campaign said Biden would hold a community meeting in Kenosha “to bring together Americans to heal and address the challenges we face.” Following that meeting, Biden and his wife, Jill, will make a “local stop,” according to the campaign. Further details weren’t available. Also see:Biden raises $364.5 million in August, breaking record for a White House campaign. Kenosha, as the Associated Press reports, has been riven by protests since the Aug. 23 shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man hit seven times in the back by police as he was getting into a car while they were trying to arrest him. Speaking in Wilmington, Del., on Wednesday, Biden said the officer who shot Blake should be charged. Trump, on the eve of his Tuesday visit, defended a teenage supporter accused of fatally shooting two men at a Kenosha demonstration and accused Biden of siding with “anarchists” and “rioters” in the unrest, AP wrote. Wisconsin’s governor and Kenosha’s mayor, both Democrats, had pleaded with Trump to stay away from the city. Trump on Tuesday blamed Wisconsin Democrats, saying “They just don’t want us to come in, and then destruction is done,” referring to his call to send in federal law enforcement. Kenosha Mayor John Antaramian also told CNN that it’s too soon for Biden to visit. Read:Trump lays blames with Democrats as he surveys ‘destruction’ in Kenosha, Wis. Trump narrowly won Wisconsin in 2016. Biden accepted his party’s nomination for president from Wilmington, Del., instead of Milwaukee after the Democratic convention planned in that city went to a largely virtual format over coronavirus concerns. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel noted Biden’s visit to Wisconsin will be his first this year, and the first to the state by a Democratic presidential nominee since 2012. Chris Wallace, the anchor of \"Fox News Sunday\" and a frequent target of Twitter barbs from President Donald Trump, will moderate the first presidential debate on Sept. 29, the Commission on Presidential Debates announced Wednesday. The second debate between Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden is scheduled for Oct. 15 and will be moderated by C-Span's political editor Steve Scully, and the third faceoff will be held Oct. 22 and moderated by NBC News White House correspondent Kristen Welker, the commission said. USA Today Washington bureau chief Susan Page will moderate the sole vice-presidential debate between Mike Pence and Kamala Harris on Oct. 7.

    "text": "President Donald Trump on Wednesday made another visit to North Carolina, as the latest polling in that swing state shows him regaining a slight edge over Democratic challenger Joe Biden in the wake of last month’s party conventions. Trump delivered a speech in Wilmington, N.C., about its designation as the first American World War II Heritage City. The port city is known in part for being home to a major shipyard during World War II, as well as for currently being home to the Battleship North Carolina, which served as a backdrop during the president’s remarks. “With this designation, we proudly declare that in America, we don’t tear down the past. We celebrate our heroes. We cherish our heritage,” Trump said, in a reference to  how statues around the world are being removed amid a re-examination of racial injustices. The president praised World War II veterans who attended his speech, such as  97-year-old Medal of Honor recipient Hershel “Woody” Williams. “He’s 100% sharp. I know a 78-year-old that’s not so sharp, but he’s 97 and he’s 100%,” Trump said, in a reference to Biden, who is 77 and will turn 78 in November. Both Trump, who is 74, and Biden have been criticized as being too old to serve as president. Ahead of Trump’s trip on Wednesday, the Biden campaign issued a statement from the former vice president criticizing the Republican incumbent. “President Trump likes to call himself a wartime president, but the reality is that North Carolinians are still suffering because he surrendered to COVID-19 long ago,” Biden said in the statement. “Instead of providing North Carolina the roadmap and resources needed to protect small businesses, schools, and families, he has criticized local leaders and threatened educators for listening to public health experts.” Biden also gave a speech Wednesday in which he attacked Trump’s push for schools to reopen quickly amid the coronavirus pandemic. Trump’s Wednesday trip follows his in-person appearance at a Republican National Convention event in Charlotte last week, when he said he “felt an obligation” to be in North Carolina, a state “that’s been very good to me.” He also criticized Biden for not going in person to his convention in Wisconsin, another battleground state. Trump is slated to campaign on Thursday in Pennsylvania, a swing state that Biden visited on Monday. Related: Trump lays blames with Democrats as he surveys ‘destruction’ in Kenosha, Wis. And see:  Biden plans Kenosha, Wis., visit on Thursday In a RealClearPolitics moving average of North Carolina polls as of Wednesday, Trump is leading Biden by 1 percentage point, after being down by 5 points a month ago. In swing states overall ahead of the Nov. 3 election, Biden still has a 2.5-point advantage over Trump, but that’s down from a 6-point edge a month ago, according to a RCP average. Betting markets give Biden just a 50.2% chance of winning vs. 61% a month ago. Victor Reklaitis is MarketWatch's Money & Politics reporter and is based in Washington, D.C.

    "title": "Asymptomatic children who contract COVID-19 may transmit coronavirus for weeks",
    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/as-schools-reopen-amid-covid-19-pandemic-how-long-do-asymptomatic-children-remain-contagious-11599043219?mod=home-page",
    "text": "A new study published in JAMA Pediatrics suggests that children can spread SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, even if they never develop symptoms or even long after symptoms have cleared. It found a significant variation in how long children continued to “shed” the virus  through their respiratory tract and, therefore, could potentially remain infectious. While the virus was detectable for an average of about 2.5 weeks in the entire group, a significant portion of the children —about a fifth of the asymptomatic patients and about half of the symptomatic ones — were still shedding virus at three weeks, meaning they were releasing it into the environment. The researchers also found that the duration of COVID-19 symptoms also varied widely, from three days to nearly three weeks. A recent systematic review estimated that 16% of children with a SARS-CoV-2 infection are asymptomatic, but evidence suggests that as many as 45% of pediatric infections are asymptomatic, according to the U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The signs and symptoms of COVID-19 in children are similar to other infections and noninfectious processes, including influenza, according to the CDC. While children infected with SARS-CoV-2 are less likely than adults to develop severe illness or complications, they are still at risk of becoming ill. “Recent COVID-19 hospitalization surveillance data shows that the rate of hospitalization among children is low (8 per 100,000 population) compared with that in adults (164.5 per 100,000 population),” the CDC said. Such research comes at an important time for families and communities. Under pressure from the teachers union to delay the start of the school year, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Tuesday that in-person classes will be pushed back until Sept. 21, 11 days later than planned. Remote learning, also originally slated to start on Sept. 10, will now commence on Sept. 16. Other countries have not fared so well with school reopenings. Israel, which also reopened schools this week, had less success when it reopened schools on May 17 amid high temperatures that made it difficult for students to wear masks, full classrooms that made social distancing near-impossible and, perhaps, the illusion that the virus had been vanquished, creating a false sense of security. The risk, as Israel discovered, is providing an environment where children unwittingly spread the virus to each other, which can lead to community transmission. That’s particularly worrying for those who have underlying conditions, and the elderly, who are more vulnerable to the most severe effects of the virus. Community transmission also makes contact tracing more difficult. A school outbreak can lead to community spread, hence the need for staggered school reopenings, social distancing and reduced class sizes. “If we find a certain number of symptomatic people testing positive, we expect the same number of asymptomatic carriers that are much more difficult to identify and isolate,” said Enrico Lavezzo, a professor in the University of Padua’s department of molecular medicine, who coauthored a study released in June of a quarantined town in Italy. The latest study in the peer-reviewed JAMA Pediatrics focused on 91 pediatric patients at 22 hospitals in South Korea. “Unlike in the American health system, those who test positive for COVID-19 in South Korea stay at the hospital until they clear their infections even if they aren’t symptomatic,” said Roberta DeBiasi, chief of the Division of Infectious Disease at the Children’s Hospital in Washington, D.C. The patients were identified for testing through contact tracing or after developing symptoms. About 22% never developed symptoms, 20% were initially asymptomatic but developed symptoms later, and 58% were symptomatic at their initial test. The hospital staff tested them every three days on average, providing a picture of how long viral shedding continues over many weeks. Among the important findings from the study: Children, a group widely thought to develop mostly mild disease that quickly passes, can shed virus for weeks, DeBiasi and Meghan Delaney, chief of the Division of Pathology and Lab Medicine at the Children’s National Hospital in Washington, D.C., wrote in a commentary piece to accompany the study in JAMA Pediatrics. Other key points: Even asymptomatic children continued to shed coronavirus after testing positive, making them potential key vectors. In this study at least, there were a large number of asymptomatic patients: About one-fifth of the group in South Korean hospitals. Researchers said the study provides important insight on the role children might play in the spread of COVID-19. But the study also had obvious limitations. One of these relates to the link between testing and transmission. A “positive” or “negative” result may not necessarily mean that a child is infectious, “with some positives reflecting bits of genetic material that may not be able to make someone sick,” or, on the other hand, “negatives reflecting low levels of virus that may still be infectious.” Researchers may have tested different parts of the respiratory tract and different testers may yield different results. It’s unclear whether symptomatic children shed different quantities of virus than symptomatic patients. They tested for the active virus  — not antibodies —  excluding those who may have had and cleared an asymptomatic or mild infection, an important factor for understanding herd immunity. However, DeBiasi said studies such as these can add to the knowledge of public-health efforts being developed and refined to bring COVID-19 under control. “Each of these pieces of information that we, our collaborators and other scientists around the world are working to gather is critical for developing policies that will slow the rate of viral transmission in our community,” she said. As of Thursday, COVID-19 had infected 26,048,163 people worldwide, which mostly does not account for asymptomatic cases, and killed 863,445. The U.S. still has the world’s highest number of COVID-19 cases (6,114,769), followed by Brazil (3,997,865), India (3,853,406) and Russia (1,006,923), according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University. In the meantime, cases keep rising in the U.S. with California becoming the first state in the country to surpass 700,000 confirmed cases; infections hit 721,281 there as of Thursday with 13,317 COVID-related deaths. New York has recorded 436,218 infections and the highest number of deaths in the U.S. (32,972). COVID has killed 185,747 people in the U.S. AstraZeneca AZN, -1.10% , in combination with Oxford University; BioNTech SE BNTX, -5.61% and partner Pfizer PFE, -2.40% ; GlaxoSmithKline GSK, -1.61% ; Johnson & Johnson JNJ, -1.23% ; Merck & Co. MERK, -0.31% ; Moderna MRNA, -2.41% ; and Sanofi SAN, -1.34% are among those currently working toward COVID-19 vaccines. The Dow Jones Industrial Index DJIA, +0.75%, the S&P 500 SPX, +0.75% and the Nasdaq Composite COMP, +1.39% all ended ended higher Wednesday.

    "title": "It seemed safe to reopen Israel’s schools, but then came COVID-19 outbreaks — what can we all learn from those mistakes?",
    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/former-israeli-coronavirus-task-force-chairman-it-seemed-safe-to-reopen-schools-but-then-came-the-outbreaks-2020-09-01?mod=home-page",
    "text": "After Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu implemented a strict lockdown in Israel in February, by early May, roughly a dozen daily new cases of coronavirus down from more than 750 per day were being reported among the country’s population of roughly 9 million people. By last month, Israel had hit 2,300 new cases in one day. But three months ago, the cost of reopening schools with so few cases of coronavirus did not seem to come close to the benefits that were believed to be gained from holding in-person classes — or so the Israeli government thought. However, a heat wave that made it difficult for students to wear masks, full classrooms that made social distancing near-impossible and, perhaps, the illusion that the virus had been vanquished all contributed to a false sense of security. Within days of reopening schools on May 17, one of the largest coronavirus outbreaks in the country occurred, prompting many schools to revert to online instruction. The hardest-hit school was Gymnasia Rehavia, a middle school and high school in the county’s capital, Jerusalem, where some 153 students and 25 staff members tested positive for coronavirus. As Rebecca Nussbaum, a teacher, told The World radio program of the first attempt to reopen schools in Israel: “We did not feel like we had any adequate time to prepare for that, in order to make sure the school was appropriately equipped for that many students coming back in one go.” “To everybody’s surprise in the school, the Thursday night before we were going back on the Sunday, we were in a staff meeting about how capsules would work; it was 9 o’clock at night and a news report came out saying that schools were opening as normal,” she added. Now the country has become a cautionary tale for what NOT to do when reopening schools. To date, Israel has reported 118,538 cases of coronavirus and 957. That translates to 10.8 deaths per 100,000 of the population or a 0.8% fatality rate. To put that in comparison, the U.S. has reported 56.4 deaths per 100,000 people and a fatality rate of 3%. The Israeli government now has a staggered system of return under its “Safe Learning” program. The country’s education ministry said approximately 2.4 million children and 205,000 education workers have resumed their school year. There will be smaller capsules for older students, and a mixture of online and in-person classes. MarketWatch spoke with Eli Waxman, a professor at the Weizmann Institute of Science and former chairman of the team advising Israel’s National Security Council on the pandemic, to understand what went wrong and what the U.S. and other countries can learn. Waxman left his position at the NSC in May after the recommendations his team made were ignored by the Israeli government, the Times of Israel reported. Eli Waxman: The contact tracing infrastructure was not built. Due to hurdles and objections within the health ministry, and due to the lack of the decision by the political level. And so we reopened physically without having this infrastructure, so there was no way to control new outbreaks. We proposed the gradual relief of social distancing measures starting with activities that are less dangerous such as construction and only later opening commerce and schools very gradually. Due to the political pressures, this program was not implemented, far from it, and all the restrictions were relieved, almost at the same time, and without proper regulations prepared for conduct in public places. So the combination of these factors led to the new uncontrolled outbreak that we’ve seen in June and July. EW: There was no plan. The health ministry was totally unprepared and, in parallel, they also removed restrictions. The original plan was to first resume activity at the lower grades up to third-grade and with reduced numbers of students per class, with masks and alcogels [disinfectants] and, after monitoring the situation for a couple of weeks, considering the resumption of activity for higher grades. We started with the lower grades and, in three days, all the grades were back to school and all the restrictions were removed. It was no surprise that we had these outbreaks. There were no capabilities to trace contacts and to isolate them and there was no way to stop the spread. EW: There are several steps that have been taken. One major development was the realization by the government and by the health ministry that an efficient and strong contact-tracing capability should be used. It was also accepted that the health ministry is not capable of doing this, and the responsibility for the construction [of this system] was moved to the army. This is something that we were recommending for months and it didn’t happen. This has happened now, and the army is building this capability. It is not set yet it is not ready but it will be ready I hope within a couple of weeks. There still debates about how school activity would resume. Some argue that the plan should be gradual, as I just described. Starting with lower grades and reducing the number of students per class, and walking in capsules, and requiring safety measures like masks and alcogels. I hope this will be implemented but it’s not at all clear to me because there are pressures to resume all activity of all grades at the same time. I’m worried that if this happens due to the pressures then we will face again serious danger of uncontrollable outbreaks. MW: A lot of countries are looking at Israel now as an example of what NOT to do. But is there anything your country has done well that you feel is not getting enough recognition? EW: The response to the first outbreak. The sooner you act, the faster you suppress the outbreak and the faster you can resume activity. The decision to close down flights and also to close school activity, and then to apply more restrictions on general activity — I think this was done in the right way early on. It allowed us to get very low numbers in April ‘and May. However, the steps that should have been taken during the time between early March and mid-May — the construction of the contact-tracing capability and setting up rules for a gradual resumption of activity — did not happen. These steps are crucial for safe resumption of activity in the presence of the virus. EW: I’m not confident because of the pressures for reopening not gradually and without precaution measures. So it really depends on how it will be done this time. If we repeat the same thing that we did last time we are going to face serious problems. I hope that we will not do it again.

    "title": "The year’s best small luxury SUVs",
    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-years-best-small-luxury-suvs-2020-09-03?mod=home-page",
    "text": "A small luxury SUV not only has the practical benefits of a compact, versatile, agile crossover, but it can be a good — and sometimes surprisingly affordable — first step into the luxury brand of your dreams. Here are the best small luxury SUVs for 2020, ranked. Score: 4.7 / 5 We’ll admit that the 2020 Audi Q5 isn’t the most budget-friendly small luxury SUV, but it’s so good that the price tag is justified. The engine options are stellar, the ride is engaging and, as usual for Audi, the interior might be the nicest in its class, and there’s plenty of room for passengers. We also like the bold yet subtle styling of this Audi, giving it a presence that can’t be ignored. Some of the technology options like the Virtual Cockpit digital gauge cluster are cutting-edge but can get pricey. Score: 4.6 / 5 Score: 4.6 / 5 The 2020 Mercedes-Benz GLC-Class is another small luxury crossover with lofty but justified pricing. This crossover gets tweaked styling inside and out keeping it fresh, plus it gets more standard and available features. The interior is as plush and comfortable as you would expect from Mercedes-Benz, and the engine options are lively, especially when you get into the high-performance AMG models. There’s a sporty “coupe” variant available, but it sacrifices some rear-seat headroom for the extra style. Score: 4.4 / 5 The X3 has long been one of our favorite compact luxury crossovers. It’s cliché to say it, but the 2020 BMW X3 truly is the BMW of small SUVs. It hits the nail on the head when it comes to bringing the soul of a sports car to the body of a crossover. It gives you SUV versatility without sacrificing much in terms of a delightful driving character. There’s a powerful range of engines available and plenty of interior space, but pricing is a little steep and you can easily get nickel-and-dimed when you start adding options. Score: 4.4 / 5 The 2020 Infiniti QX50 is an interesting and often-overlooked choice in small premium SUVs. It draws you in with its fetching styling and its attractive pricing, and the variable compression VC-Turbo engine under the hood does an excellent job blending V6-like performance with the fuel economy of a 4-cylinder. It’s pretty generous with standard infotainment and driver-assist technologies, but adding more options on top of that can start to get pricey. Once you get into the higher trims, you’re in the pricing territory of more luxurious competitors. Score: 4.4 / 5 If you’ve always wanted a Lexus and like the idea of a practical compact crossover, then the 2020 Lexus NX is the SUV for you. It delivers the safety, reliability and bold styling that Lexus is famous for, all at a reasonable price. The ride is smooth and comfortable, but if you’re looking for fun-to-drive performance, you may want to look to its European competitors. The fuel economy of the NX is respectable, and it gets much better if you opt for the frugal hybrid option, which doesn’t have much of a price premium over the standard model. Score: 4.3 / 5 The 2020 Cadillac XT4 is one of the most affordably priced luxury crossovers on this list, and it presents a great value if you’re looking to get into the Cadillac brand. The XT4 combines sharp styling with practicality in the form of a roomy interior with generous rear-seat legroom. A few downsides include an awkward infotainment system and a little more road noise inside than we’d like. We wish there was a higher-performance V model available, but the sole engine option in this Cadillac is smooth, refined and pretty good on gas. Score: 4.3 / 5 The 2020 Volvo XC60 still feels fresh from its 2018 redesign, and it offers something a little different in this crowded segment. It has a stylish and unconventional look inside and out with a posh interior and unbelievably comfortable seats with some of the highest-quality leather you’ll find in any car. Standard safety features are abundant, as you might expect from a Volvo. The high-performance (and high-price) plug-in hybrid Polestar model is a riot to drive, but the lower-end trims don’t offer very engaging driving dynamics. Score: 4.2 / 5 If you’re looking for a small SUV that is guaranteed to turn heads, the 2020 Land Rover Range Rover Evoque is a standout. It’s also a more capable off-roader than you might expect, and it lives up to its Range Rover pedigree when the pavement ends. The engine choices are both powerful and efficient, and you won’t likely get bored behind the wheel. We love the sharp exterior, but that narrow side glass makes for a bit of a claustrophobic cabin. Like many Land Rover models, its lofty price tag makes it a questionable value compared with class rivals. Score: 4.2 / 5 The 2020 Lincoln Corsair is an all-new compact SUV for the American luxury brand, and we’re impressed. It’s stylish, quiet and comfortable, which is par for the course for the resurgent Lincoln brand. The interior is a serene sanctuary with plenty of room for passengers and cargo with sliding and reclining 2nd-row seats. The Corsair is very competitively priced at the base level, but if you get into the upper trims with the optional engine upgrade, it can get into the same pricing territory as the bigger, 3-row Aviator. A plug-in hybrid Corsair Grand Touring is on the way, but we haven’t driven it yet as of this writing. Score: 4.2 / 5 From the driver’s seat, the 2020 Porsche Macan lives up to its brand’s legacy. The Macan blends luxury and performance in a way that few competitors can match, but it’s not the most practical choice in this segment. The interior space is a little tight, and its fuel economy is unimpressive, but what the Macan lacks in everyday practicality it makes up for in driving excitement, especially in the higher-performance models. The Macan has the highest starting price on this list by a considerable margin, but it’s also very nice on the base level. Score: 4.1 / 5 The 2020 Alfa Romeo Stelvio is a seductive Italian luxury crossover at a price that’s competitive with its European rivals. The Stelvio delivers a high level of excitement, but not the highest level of refinement. Cargo space is a bit tight, but the cabin is reasonably roomy for passengers. This stylish Alfa boasts best-in-class standard horsepower and torque, and things get really crazy when you upgrade to the high-performance Quadrifoglio model. All of that power is delivered to the road in a composed manner with crisp handling and a comfortable ride. Score: 4.1 / 5 You can look at it from any angle and the 2020 Jaguar F-Pace is unmistakably a Jaguar. The F-Pace delivers real Jaguar performance — especially with its supercharged engine options in the upper trims — but doles out a nice measure of practicality with its generous interior space for both passengers and cargo. This is a nice SUV, but some of the cabin materials are a bit substandard considering the price of this Jag. We like the performance and the roominess, but the F-Pace has one of the highest starting prices in this segment, and its value proposition is questionable. Score: 3.6 / 5 The 2020 Buick Envision is a bit torn between the mainstream and luxury categories. The Envision has a few things going for it like budget-friendly pricing, a strong turbocharged engine option and sliding and reclining back seats, but it’s not up to par with its more expensive competitors in terms of interior luxury or driving excitement. The base engine is dull, and we really recommend springing for the turbo if you’re shopping for an Envision. If you’re looking for the most elegant and opulent compact SUV, you’ll have to shop elsewhere and pay a lot more, but the Envision is good for drivers looking for a luxury bargain. Score: 3.6 / 5 The Land Rover Discovery Sport sits at the bottom of our list because it just isn’t as refined or luxurious as the best small luxury SUVs in this class. Driver-assist technologies that come standard on many competitors are optional in this Land Rover, and its fuel economy is underwhelming, even from the hybrid. Where the Discovery Sport shines is off-road where it’s more capable than most rivals, plus it carries a reasonable base price. Drivers who do most of their driving on the pavement will be better off shopping elsewhere. This story originally ran on Autotrader.com.

    "text": "My husband and I have been married for almost eight years. Prior to marriage we had a prenuptial agreement made, where his RV and truck remained his to do whatever with, as my home and car remained mine. His RV is his pride and joy, and his “man cave” on wheels. I recently learned that his RV is “upside down.” He owes $75,000 more on it than it’s worth. My concern is that if something happens to him, I will end up with a lien on my home. My name is not on the RV, nor is his name on my home. Your help and thoughts are very much appreciated. Thank you. That was a clear prenuptial agreement. What’s yours is yours and what’s his is his, and anything you earn during your marriage is, I presume, shared. More or less. It sounds like you want to commingle your lives, but not your finances. Boys love their toys and he clearly takes great pride in his man cave on wheels, and it was and is important to him that it’s his, and his alone. That’s good news for you: You are not liable for this debt, if his name alone is on the loan. In community-property states — Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin — debt incurred during a marriage is deemed “community” responsibility. That is, both spouses are liable for that debt. In Alaska, newlyweds can choose to opt into community property rules. In other common-law states, spouses can incur debt on credit cards and RV loans during their marriage, and they are solely responsible for them. The Moneyist: My mother’s will says her boyfriend can live in her home after she dies. Can I still kick him out if the deed is transferred to me? There is one major exception to these rules, according to the American Bankruptcy Institute. You are liable for medical debts of your spouse under a legal theory called the Doctrine of Necessities. “The necessities rule is not limited to medical bills. It could apply to utilities, rent, food, clothing and any other necessities, but the most common lawsuit utilizing this legal concept is in the collection of medical debts,” it says. (At least two states, Virginia and Alabama, challenged this.) “In Nebraska, when you marry someone you also marry their future medical debts. If your spouse incurs medical debts during the marriage, you are liable for the debt. Even if the bills only come in the name of your spouse. Even if you did not sign for the debts. Even if you did not authorize the treatment. Even if you are separated. In Nebraska, when you marry someone you also marry their future medical debts. This doctrine has been accepted in Nebraska courts,” the institute adds. The Moneyist:My husband and I are worth $3.7 million, but I’m afraid I’ll spend my way into the poor house if he dies. When I was single, I bounced checks. What can I do? This does not, however, account for the indirect costs of a spouse incurring debts. You started your marriage with your eyes open, so you should continue in that spirit. Organize a monthly budget so you know where your red lines are on spending, and how much you need to earn to keep the books balanced, and put money aside for an emergency fund. You may also want to see if your husband can cut back on his spending to pay off his RV debt sooner rather than later. You’re a team. Worst-case scenario: If your husband cannot pay off the debt owed on his RV, it would obviously be repossessed by the company. If you or he lost his job, on the other hand, presumably the other spouse would shoulder the burden and help the other out. If he asks you to help out with the payments on his RV? That’s another question entirely. Hopefully, that won’t happen, Mary Ellen, and you and your husband will have a long and happy life together, and a few memorable trips in his RV.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/rvs-or-motels-heres-how-some-travelers-are-packing-and-preparing-for-a-safer-covid-19-road-trip-2020-09-03?mod=home-page",
    "text": "This article is reprinted by permission from NextAvenue.org. Emma Bateman Frasure, 70, took several road trips this summer, doing some things she had never done before: Packing a safety and cleaning kit, and calling ahead to shows and attractions to confirm they were open and to make sure they hadn’t altered their hours. This is just an example of the way in which the COVID-19 pandemic has changed how many people travel. Frasure first drove about eight hours from her home in Mountain Home, Ark. to pick up her 13-year-old granddaughter for a one-month visit; from there, they took a couple of shorter trips for shopping, sightseeing and shows in Branson and Springfield, Mo. The pair ended their travels by meeting up with Frasure’s son in Nashville where the family also did some sightseeing. Before embarking on each journey, Frasure packed plenty of hand sanitizer, masks, antibacterial soap, sanitizing sprays and cleaning supplies to clean the motel rooms. “I was pretty conscientious before with washing my hands, not touching my face while away from home and using hand sanitizer, but made it a point this time to clean the motel rooms — at least the often-touched surfaces such as doorknobs, handles, the bathroom sink, toilet and television remote,” says Frasure. “I always check the bed (for bed bugs), but also sprayed the sheets and pillows with disinfectant spray.” Brooke Johnson, owner of Tumbleweed Travel, a Telluride, Colo. company that books all-inclusive RV road trips and camping excursions, says the number of people taking RV and camping trips has “gotten crazy” this year. “I went on a trip and looked for a spot at a campground in California and found the very last one,” says Johnson, who adds that her phones have remained busy since spring. “Once people rent or buy their RV, they have their own bedroom, bathroom and kitchen; people feel safer farther away from [other] people, and outdoors,” she says. “Going in an RV is a great way to camp now, especially for people who don’t consider themselves as ‘campers.’” Johnson says people have been renting or buying a variety of campers and RVs, from the pop-up pull-behinds to large luxury RVs. “The camping vans also seem really popular right now,” she says. Angelina Zeppieri, a luxury travel adviser for Elli Travel Group in New York City, says she has definitely seen an increase in the number of road trips her clients are taking this year. “They were previously traveling abroad, but with the virus, we are seeing a lot more local road trips, especially in the Tri-State area around New York,” she says. Zeppieri’s clients have also been asking for more private rental bookings, including cabins. “Normally, our clients want to stay in resorts and higher-end hotels. But this year, people want less interaction, and space,” she says. Zeppieri saw such an increase that she formed a group of private owners to rent their homes in the Catskills. Both Johnson and Zeppieri say they have seen most RV and cabin owners take extra care in cleaning and sanitizing them. “I have seen many [cabin owners] hiring professional cleaning and disinfecting companies, doing extra things to put their guests at ease, such as covering the remote controls in plastic and putting up signs advising of the steps taken to clean and disinfect and when it was done,” says Zeppieri. “I’ve even seen them adding extra time between guests. So, instead of a guest checking out in the morning and the cabin being rented by evening, they may be giving it 24 hours.” In addition to packing a safety kit for each member of your family that includes masks, gloves and hand sanitizer, you might also want to include cleaning supplies for your room or accommodations. 1. Check for state-to-state travel restrictions, closures and altered hours. Terika L. Haynes, owner of Dynamite Travel in Melbourne, Fla., says there still are plenty of states with state-to-state travel restrictions. She recommends checking with state and local tourism boards for guidance, as well as other information on closures and restrictions. “Many travelers have experienced surprise closures and travel restrictions when they’ve left their state,” says Haynes. “The restrictions have been changing frequently, so I would suggest calling ahead and checking again several times before your trip.” 2. Pack snacks and possibly meals. “There are a few things you may encounter, such as finding restaurants unexpectedly closed or out of business,” says Haynes. “Or you might find restaurants not abiding by social distancing guidelines and you don’t feel safe. Also, your hotel may have their dining options and restaurants closed.” Frasure also advises travelers to remember to get up and wash their hands after handling menus, or at least use hand sanitizer. 3. Call ahead and learn about cleaning protocols. Whether you are renting an RV or cabin or staying in a hotel room, Zeppieri recommends phoning ahead and speaking with the owner or manager about their cleaning protocols. “Ask the time they are allowing between guests,” she says. “Make sure you’re comfortable with it before booking.” 4. Bring your own linens. Surprisingly, when researching many hotels, Haynes found that most aren’t offering housekeeping services during a guest’s stay. “They’re asking guests to get clean towels from the desk,” says Haynes. “Of the many I checked out, I only found one currently offering housekeeping services.” While you can spray the sheets and pillows, as Frasure did, it may also make you feel more comfortable to have your own linens. 5. Book early for fall. As the summer travel season winds down, you may find it easier to book into hotels. RV and cabin rentals for the late summer and fall still remain robust, especially since this is normally a popular time for retirees to travel. By planning ahead and taking precautions, Frasure says, she had a good time with her granddaughter and adult son. “I felt really safe and we visited quite a few places,” she says. “I believe if you follow recommended precautions and wash your hands frequently, use hand sanitizer, wear your masks and social distance, you can have a pretty safe trip.” Kerri Fivecoat-Campbell is a full-time freelance writer and author living in the Ozark Mountains.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/uk-house-prices-surge-to-all-time-high-in-august-2020-09-02?mod=home-page",
    "text": "House prices in the U.K. surged to an all-time high in August, fueled by pent-up demand and record low mortgage rates, according to new figures from Nationwide. Britain’s biggest building society said prices jumped by 2% in August, following a 1.8% rise in July, marking the highest monthly increase since February 2004. Annual house price growth jumped to 3.7% last month from 1.5% in July. The average price was £224,123 ($298,864) in August, up from just under £170,000 10 years ago, Nationwide said. Robert Gardner, Nationwide’s chief economist, said the bounce back in prices reflects the unexpectedly rapid recovery in housing market activity since the easing of lockdown restrictions. “This rebound reflects a number of factors. Pent-up demand is coming through, where decisions taken to move before lockdown are progressing. Behavioral shifts may also be boosting activity, as people reassess their housing needs and preferences as a result of life in lockdown,” he said. The housing market was hit hard in March at the height of the lockdown, as estate agents were forced to close their offices and viewings weren’t allowed. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the next few months are crucial for Barratt because, while the group demonstrated its strength during the lockdown, an extended recession would prove an even tougher test. “The taxpayer funded furlough scheme, mortgage holidays and a ban on evictions are all due to be unwound in the autumn, which all could have major implications on demand for housing going forward,” she said. Read:U.K. jobs picture looks bleak with 7.5 million furloughed or away from their job Shares in Barratt rose 6.91% in early morning London trading. Gardner said that the trends look set to continue in the near term, further boosted by Chancellor Rishi Sunak’s recently announced stamp duty holiday — the transfer tax paid when buying a home. However, Gardner cautioned that most forecasters expect labor market conditions to weaken significantly in the quarters ahead, as a result of the after effects of the pandemic and as government support schemes wind down. “If this comes to pass, it would likely dampen housing activity once again in the quarters ahead,” Gardner said.

    "title": "Losing the extra $600 unemployment benefit may not have stopped Americans from spending money, J.P. Morgan credit card data show",
    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/losing-the-extra-600-unemployment-benefit-may-not-have-stopped-americans-from-spending-money-jp-morgan-credit-card-data-shows-2020-08-28?mod=home-page",
    "text": "Whether or not you believe the now-expired $600 weekly unemployment benefit was overly generous or not, like stimulus checks, they allowed more Americans to spend money. But even without the enhanced unemployment benefit, Americans are still reaching for their wallets in stores, restaurants and auto dealerships, data shows. In July, personal spending rose by 1.9%, the government said Friday. That spending happened while more than 30 million jobless Americans were receiving an additional $600 in weekly federal unemployment benefits on top of what they were receiving from their state. That benefit, a provision in the CARES Act, ended at the end of July, and as a result, the average amount of weekly unemployment benefits Americans received fell to $257 from $812. Some economists predicted that one consequence of ending the $600 weekly benefit would be that  Americans would spend less money, which would harm the already-struggling U.S. economy.  One forecast by the Bureau of Economic Analysis suggested that losing the extra $600 would strip more than 20 million Americans of nearly $842 billion to spend. “When the economy’s growth is demand-constrained, anything that keeps households from cutting back on spending actually supports growth,” Josh Bivens, director of research at the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank, said in June. “Cutting off a policy support that helps households maintain spending is a terrible idea, both for these households’ welfare and for macroeconomic stabilization.” Unsurprisingly, that spending is more prevalent in states with low rates of unemployment compared to states with unemployment rates above 7.8%, Chase data shows. “But we see little sign that the benefit expiration has marked a major turning point for the overall economy, as many other high-frequency spending and activity indicators have continued rising into August,” Jesse Edgerton, an economist at J.P. Morgan said in a note to investors. “We conclude that the evidence thus far suggests that the expiration of the extra $600 of weekly unemployment benefits has produced some effects on the data in parts of the economy that are most directly impacted, but it has not marked a sharp turning point for the overall economy,” he wrote. But Ernie Tedeschi, an economist in the Obama-era Treasury Department now at Evercore ISI, is skeptical of that. “Most unemployment insurance benefits are sent via pre-paid debit cards. If those cards aren’t Chase cards, then J.P. Morgan’s analysis may be missing the effect of [the $600 weekly] unemployment insurance expiration.” “In fact, if unemployment insurance recipients are substituting their prior cash benefits with credit card charges, J.P. Morgan may be interpreting that as stronger spending,” he added.“25 to 30 million people losing $600 for a month is roughly $60-$70 billion in lost income. That’s a lot. So much in fact that it’s bound to have some effect.” Democratic lawmakers had pushed to extend the extra $600 through Jan. 2021, deeming it essential to keep struggling American families afloat. But Republicans felt the benefit was too generous, given that two-thirds of jobless Americans were receiving more in unemployment benefits than they did from their prior jobs. The two parties failed to reach a compromise. As a result, President Donald Trump issued a memorandum calling for the distribution of an additional $300 in weekly federal unemployment benefits on top of the state benefits that unemployed people typically receive. The source of that extra $300 is a $44 billion fund set aside for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 35 states have been approved by FEMA to start distributing these funds. As of Friday, six states had started handing out the money. The add-on benefit is set to expire at the end of December, but funds are likely to dry up in a matter of weeks, absent of any legislative action.

    "title": "Moving? What you should know about doing it in a pandemic",
    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-to-move-in-a-pandemic-2020-09-02?mod=home-page",
    "text": "This article is reprinted by permission from NerdWallet. Moving is stressful enough without throwing a pandemic into the mix. Many Americans may be forced to consider moving as some federal foreclosure and eviction moratoriums have expired. In the first week of July, 32% of Americans did not make a full, on-time housing payment, according to a nationally representative survey by the website Apartment List. Others may relocate to save money, be closer to loved ones or simply leave a densely populated area. If you’re considering moving, here’s what to know from a financial standpoint, as well as tips to make moving day safer. Aside from the usual expenses like buying boxes, renting a van or hiring movers, plan for extra costs because of the pandemic. You may need to buy heavy-duty supplies to deep-clean your old place, for example, or to sanitize your new accommodations. If you are moving out of a rental unit, some landlords may ask you to pay for professional cleaners or take the cost out of your security deposit. The Big Move: I work in Silicon Valley, but my job is now remote. I can finally live somewhere cheaper. Where should I go? Moving across county or state lines? Check what the quarantine requirements are in your new location, says Jean Wilczynski, a certified financial planner and senior wealth adviser at Exencial Wealth Advisors in Old Lyme, Connecticut. You may have to pay for quarantine accommodations like a hotel or Airbnb if your new apartment or home is not move-in ready, she says. If you are receiving unemployment benefits, check the rules on how your benefits carry forward in your new location and what the taxes are if it is a new state, Wilczynski says. You can typically find this information on your state’s Department of Labor website, she says. If you are unemployed or your income has dropped as a result of the pandemic, you can also check whether you qualify for moving assistance by calling 211. You might not be able to really get to know your new place until you’re living there, so prepare yourself (and your wallet) for surprises like leaky faucets or broken appliances. Landlords and real-estate agents may offer only virtual tours. And if you can see the new accommodations in person, you may be required to sign a waiver, wear a mask and avoid touching anything while in the house. How to move safely depends on whether you are doing it yourself or using movers. Current guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that the main way the coronavirus spreads is through respiratory droplets, says Lindsay Slowiczek, pharmacist and drug content integrity manager at Healthline.com. That’s why wearing a mask and staying away from people is important to slow the spread of the virus, she says. Sanitizing surfaces is also an extra precaution worth taking. If you’re renting a moving truck, companies like U-Haul offer contactless pickup and drop-off options. Slowiczek suggests sanitizing the door handles, steering wheel, radio and the metal tongue on the seat belt in the rental van. Before picking a moving company, check its website or call and ask about its safety practices in response to the pandemic, Slowiczek says. Ask whether the movers wear masks and gloves during the move. On moving day, she suggests being prepared with a plan to limit interaction with movers and maintain social distancing. This includes packing as many things as you can yourself, or consider using a self-pack moving container as Slowiczek did for her own recent move. The Big Move: I’m tired of renting in Manhattan, but love living in New York. Is now the time to buy if the city is supposedly dead? If the movers will pack the truck, create a schedule for the movers. For example, ask them to start with a particular room as you stay in another. This is also particularly useful if you live with family members who are vulnerable or immunocompromised, she says. Try to limit their involvement with the move as much as possible. “Plan out the way [the movers] are going to move through the house,” says Slowiczek. “If possible, move all of [your boxes] to one area in your home so they don’t have to come throughout your house as much.” Keep hand sanitizer or soap handy during the move so that you and the movers can use it periodically, she says. (Check on the FDA website that your brand of hand sanitizer is methanol-free, Slowiczek adds). After the move, use disinfectants registered with the Environmental Protection Agency to clean surfaces or furniture. “Just using the product as-is is not enough — read the instructions on how long it should be wet on the surface,” Slowiczek says.

Unlike the federal moratorium included in the CARES Act that expired in late July, the CDC's moratorium will apply to all rental units nationwide, senior administration officials said. Renters will be eligible for the moratorium's protection if they received a stimulus check, and they must be able to prove that they made an effort to receive government assistance and that they could not afford rent. Grocery shoppers are cutting back on spending, data show, a sign that Americans are hurting for cash as the federal unemployment stimulus remains on hold for most recipients.

    "url": "https://www.mansionglobal.com/articles/real-estate-scion-daniel-tishman-lists-57-acre-westchester-estate-219182?mod=home-page",
    "text": "New York City real estate scion and philanthropist Daniel Tishman is selling Sugar Hill, his family’s longtime Westchester estate, for $14 million, Mansion Global has learned. The main house is a Georgian-style white-washed brick mansion surrounded by 57 acres in Armonk, New York, a small hamlet that’s about a 10-minute drive from Greenwich, Connecticut, and less than an hour from Manhattan (and happens to be home to IBM’s global headquarters). The vast estate comes with a pool, professional tennis courts and a caretaker’s apartment above the garage. Mr. Tishman, 64, whose family has been a major player in New York City's construction and real estate industry for more than a century—a history that includes building the first World Trade Center in the 1970s and its recent rebirth—has owned Sugar Hill with his wife, Sheryl, for decades, according to public property records. The Tishmans, who could not be reached for comment, quietly listed the property in August. The grand 1930s house is about a minute’s walk to Mianus River Gorge Preserve, a conservation area of nearly 1,000 acres of hiking and walking trails amid a forest of 300-year-old hemlocks. Sally Slater, a broker with Douglas Elliman who is marketing Sugar Hill, said she sold the home to the owners 20 years ago, around the same time she also sold a former Rockefeller estate across the street, which spans more than 100 acres. All of that private acreage paired with the nearby parklands means Sugar Hill has the benefit of being “dead quiet,” she said. The owners have updated almost every part of the house, redoing the kitchen and bathrooms and building an addition, Ms. Slater said. The home has six bedrooms, seven-plus bathrooms, a fitness room and plenty of distinct areas for a family to spread out and find their own space, she added. “You don’t really ever need to leave the house,” Ms. Slater said. The main floor includes a sunny, wood-paneled office that doubles as a library. There’s also a secondary office attached to the main bedroom suite. The property’s large, fenced pastures are also well suited to raising horses and other animals. The acreage is spread across three distinct lots, which means building out a family compound with additional structures would be fairly straightforward, Ms. Slater added. The large, amenity-rich home comes to market at a time when urban-dwellers have bull-rushed New York City’s bedroom communities in search of space and less density. Common comparisons to the post-9/11 flight from New York City pale in comparison to the current activity, Ms. Slater said. “It’s just wild,” she said, adding that bidding wars are now common for anything south of $5 million. “I don’t see it slowing down.” Mr. Tishman is the great grandson of Julius Tishman, who founded Tishman Realty, a property managing and development company that evolved into one of the nation’s leading construction businesses. It is responsible for some of Manhattan’s biggest projects, including Hudson Yards on the far West Side and most of the World Trade Center complex. COPYRIGHT © 2020 MANSION GLOBAL.

    "text": "The coronavirus pandemic has led to a surge in big-budget buyers in the U.K, and as their numbers grow, so does their urgency to move, according to the latest prime housing market report Wednesday from Savills. The number of sales nationwide priced at more than £1 million (US$1.3 million) skyrocketed 116% during the first two weeks of August compared to the same period last year, the estate agency said. More: J. Lo and A-Rod Find Buyer For Their Malibu Beach Home After Just a Month There are close to twice as many buyers in the market for new homes now than there were last summer, and three times as many looking for country houses, resulting in the strongest market since 2007, said Savills, which based its findings on a survey conducted in mid-August of 1,400 registered buyers and sellers. Driving demand is the new set of home requirements that have emerged on buyers’ wishlists following weeks spent at home, including home offices and gardens, according to the survey. “Many predicted that the immediate shift in priorities seen in April was just a response to lockdown, and would be short-lived, but this latest survey highlights greater commitment from people to make real changes,” Frances Clacy, an analyst at Savills, said in the report. Further underpinning the strong rebound in high-end housing activity that has emerged since the U.K.’s markets began reopening in May is the relative financial security of buyers at the top end, and a rush to take advantage of the stamp duty holiday. The latter, “when combined with the experience of lockdown, is bringing forward purchases that may otherwise have happened in two or more years’ time,” Ms. Clacy said. According to the survey, 21% of respondents are now more committed to a move within the next 12 months, up from just 9% in April, a figure that grows to 25% for residents in London.

    "text": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates and MONTREAL, Sept. 3, 2020 - DP World, a global infrastructure-led supply chain solutions provider, and Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (CDPQ), a global institutional investor, announce the expansion of their ports and terminals investment through a new commitment of US$4.5 billion, that will increase the total size of the platform to US$8.2 billion. DP World holds 55% share of the platform, and CDPQ the remaining 45%. Since its launch in December 2016, the platform has invested in 10 port terminals globally and across various stages of the asset life cycle. The enhanced platform will continue to target assets globally, but with an increased scope to broaden its footprint in existing geographies, as well as new regions such as Europe and Asia Pacific. The investment platform will pursue its deployment and diversification objectives by expanding across a wider part of the integrated marine supply chain, such as logistics services linked to terminals. Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem, Group Chairman and CEO, DP World, said: \"The partnership between DP World and CDPQ has been very successful, and we have benefited from each other's expertise.

    "title": "Calfrac Shareholders Have a Direct Path to a Premium-To-Market Recovery by Voting Down the Management Transaction",
    "url": "https://www.prnewswire.com//news-releases/calfrac-shareholders-have-a-direct-path-to-a-premium-to-market-recovery-by-voting-down-the-management-transaction-301123699.html",
    "text": "CISCO, Texas, Sept. 3, 2020 - Wilks Brothers, LLC (\"Wilks\") provides the true facts in response to recent statements by Calfrac Well Services Ltd. (\"Calfrac\" or the \"Company\") (TSX: CFW). Calfrac has attempted to distract shareholders from the obvious flaws of the Management Plan by raising irrelevant issues and indulging in inuendo. Shareholders should focus on the real facts and Wilks' announced intention to make the Premium Offer to Shareholders as they vote down the flawed management transaction. Shareholders should use the BLUE PROXY to vote AGAINST the Management Transaction. The facts set out below, and a side-by-side comparison of the Management Transaction vs Wilks Superior Alternative Proposal can be found in a new presentation that can be found at www.afaircalfrac.com. Calfrac Statement: \"Wilks is a wolf in sheep's clothing\". Wilks rejects this false and defamatory characterization and reminds its fellow shareholders of the adage that: \"The sheep spends its entire life fearing the Wolf, only to be eaten by the Shepherd\". Ron Mathison and MATCO are the only shareholders who will be entitled to receive additional benefits under the Management Transaction. Mathison/MATCO: Calfrac Statement: \"The only transaction that is available is the Management Transaction\". The Management Transaction is NOT the only transaction that is available. On September 1, 2020 Wilks announced that they intend to make a formal take over bid to acquire all of Calfrac's common shares for $0.18 per share (the \"Premium Offer\"). This offer will provide Shareholders with a clear path to financial recovery if the Management Transaction is voted down at the Shareholders meeting to be held on September 17, 2020 (the \"Meeting\") and is not ultimately approved by the Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta. The Management Transaction is not the only transaction that is available. The Premium Offer provides a highly attractive cash recovery to Shareholders if Calfrac does not move forward with the Wilks Superior Alternative Proposal and even if Calfrac makes good on its implied threat to commence proceedings under the Companies Creditors Arrangement Act  (Canada) (the \"CCAA\") should the Management Transaction not proceed.  Under the terms of the Premium Offer, Shareholder recovery will NOT be threatened by a CCAA filing. The Offer will nullify the threats made to Shareholders by the entrenched Board and management of Calfrac by guaranteeing a premium-to-market recovery to Shareholders. The Superior Alternative Proposal, which provides a premium recovery to Shareholders, remains fully available to Calfrac. The Superior Alternative Proposal is not subject to any financing or due diligence conditions and can be immediately implemented. The only way Shareholders can benefit from a better deal for themselves is by VOTING DOWN the Management Transaction. Calfrac Statement: \"George Armoyan and his affiliated company, G2S2 Capital, act entirely independently and at arm's length to MATCO and the other parties to this transaction. Adding together the holdings of these parties to invent a control position does not equate to the 63% control position sought by Wilks Brothers\". By entering into the \"Investor Agreement\" described in the Management Information Circular, Mathison, G2S2 and the other unsecured noteholders will likely be presumed to be acting \"jointly and in concert\" under applicable law and will therefore be deemed, collectively, to be a \"control person\" of Calfrac. Calfrac Statement: \"Wilks Brothers also never explains why it continuously seeks, in both Canada and the United States, to force Calfrac into insolvency, while it concurrently seeks to seduce Calfrac stakeholders into rejecting the only executable deal that is on the table. This combination of actions makes no common sense, and creates untenable risk for stakeholders\". It is not Wilks who have created this mess; the blame lies at the feet of the Calfrac board and management. It is those insiders who have handed over their fiduciary duties to a group of noteholders, thereby creating an OPPRESSIVE regime and disenfranchising stakeholders. In contrast, Wilks is seeking an outcome that is fair to all. Calfrac Statement: \"The real problem is: Wilks Brothers seeking to own over 63% of Calfrac's equity in a no premium change of control, while it also owns 100% of a direct competitor (ProFrac). This would diminish future opportunities for Calfrac, in particular, pursuing a premium value at a better time in the cycle\". Calfrac Statement: \"The Recapitalization Transaction is better for Unsecured Noteholders above $400 million TEV\". Calfrac Statement: \"All eligible Unsecured Noteholders have the opportunity to participate in the 1.5 Lien Notes\". The participation of these noteholders in the 1.5 Lien financing is limited. If the self-selected noteholders and MATCO were actually interested in allowing broad participation by unsecured noteholders they would have structured the 1.5 Lien financing as a \"backstopped\" offering of 1.5 Lien notes, in which every unsecured noteholder could participate pro rata. Calfrac Statement: \"It is impossible for Calfrac shareholders to know how they would fare if they ended up in a company controlled by Wilks Brothers. Wilks Brothers will simply not explain how Calfrac could ever prosper, with Wilks Brothers as a future 63% shareholder, while competing and colliding directly with ProFrac, which is 100% owned by Wilks Brothers. An independent Calfrac is far better than one controlled by Wilks Brothers, which would then hold the power, if it wished: to squeeze Calfrac out of business; and to propose another disadvantageous business combination, where Calfrac would have essentially no alternatives. A deal with Wilks Brothers would carry significant, unmeasurable risks\". Calfrac Statement: \"Calfrac has been criticized for agreeing to its new financing with parties who hold Unsecured Notes. To be clear, these were the parties prepared to provide new, much-needed financing to Calfrac on reasonable terms; and MATCO's participation was considered to be an important reassurance to other investors\". Wilks reminds all Shareholders to VOTE AGAINST THE MANAGEMENT TRANSACTION USING THE BLUE VOTING FORM THAT HAS BEEN SENT TO YOU BY WIILKS. Shareholders should also review Wilks' Proxy Circular dated August 24, 2020 which has been mailed to shareholders and copies of which have posted to Calfrac's SEDAR profile, and are also available at www.afaircalfrac.com. Shareholders who have questions or require voting assistance, may contact our communications advisor and proxy solicitation agent, Laurel Hill Advisory Group, by phone, toll-free at 1-877-452-7184 (North America) or +1-416-304-0211 (outside North America) or by e-mail at [email protected]. Wilks is relying on the exemption under section 9.2(4) of National Instrument 51-102 - Continuous Disclosure Obligations and exemptive relief provided by the Alberta Securities Commission in an Order dated August 4, 2020 (the \"Order\") to make this public broadcast solicitation. The following information is provided in accordance with corporate and securities laws applicable to public broadcast solicitations. This solicitation is being made by Wilks, and not by or on behalf of the management of Calfrac. Wilks has engaged Laurel Hill Advisory Group to act as our communications advisor and proxy solicitation agent. Based upon publicly available information, Calfrac's registered office is at 4500, 855-2nd Street S.W. Calgary, Alberta, Canada, T2P 4K7, and its head office is at 411-8th Avenue S.W. Calgary, Alberta, Canada, T2P 1E3. Wilks is soliciting proxies in reliance upon the public broadcast exemption to the solicitation requirements under applicable Canadian corporate and securities laws (including the Order), conveyed by way of public broadcast, including press release, speech or publication, and by any other manner permitted under applicable Canadian laws. In addition, this solicitation may be made by mail, telephone, facsimile, email or other electronic means as well as by newspaper or other media advertising and in person. All costs incurred for the solicitation will be borne by Wilks. Wilks and Dan and Staci Wilks together hold 28,720,172 Common Shares, representing approximately 19.78% of the issued and outstanding Common Shares of Calfrac on the basis of Calfrac's disclosure in its management information circular dated August 17, 2020. that there are 145,616,827 Common Shares outstanding. Certain information in this Press Release may constitute \"forward-looking information\", as such term is defined in applicable Canadian securities legislation, about the objectives of Wilks as they relate to Calfrac.

Material factors or assumptions that were applied in providing forward-looking information include, but are not limited to: the intention of Wilks to make a formal take-over bid for the shares of Calfrac and the results of such bid; that required regulatory approvals will be obtained on terms satisfactory to Wilks; the reaction of Calfrac's Board and management to the proposed Premium Bid; the response to and outcome of any applications to Courts or regulators relating to the transactions described herein or otherwise that may be made by or against Calfrac or Wilks. Forward-looking information contained in this Press Release reflects current reasonable assumptions, beliefs, opinions and expectations of Wilks regarding future events and operating performance of Calfrac and speaks only as of the date of this  Press Release. Such forward-looking information is based on currently publicly available competitive, financial and economic data and operating plans and is subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of Calfrac, or general industry results, to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking information. Many other factors could also cause Calfrac's actual results, performance or achievements to vary from those expressed or inferred herein, including, without limitation, the success of the proposed Premium Bid, the reaction of the market and Calfrac's shareholders, creditors and customers to the Premium Bid, the impact of legislative, regulatory, competitive and technological changes; the state of the economy; credit and equity markets; the financial markets in general; price volatility; interest rate and exchange rate fluctuations; general economic conditions and other risks involved in the hydraulic fracking industry. The impact of any one factor on a particular piece of forward-looking information is not determinable with certainty as such factors are interdependent upon other factors, and Wilks' course of action would depend upon its assessment of the future considering all information then available. Should any factor affect Calfrac in an unexpected manner, or should any assumptions underlying the forward-looking information prove incorrect, the actual results or events may differ materially from the events predicted. All of the forward-looking information reflected in this Press Release is qualified by these cautionary statements. There can be no assurance that the results or developments anticipated by Wilks will be realized or, even if substantially realized, that they will have the expected consequences for Calfrac, Calfrac's shareholders or Wilks. Forward-looking information is provided, and forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this Press Release and except as may be required by applicable law, Wilks disclaims any intention and assumes no obligation to publicly update or revise such forward-looking information or forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

(the \"Company\" or \"MFH\") (Nasdaq: MFH) today announced its unaudited financial results for the six months ended June 30, 2020. All comparisons are made on a year-over-year basis. Ms. Hua Zhou, Chairperson of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, commented, \"We are pleased with the operating results of our first half year. We have increased our revenues to $1.4 million, with a non-GAAP operating income of $0.53 million. Due to the uncertainty as a result of global pandemic and new product development, the Company will not provide a financial forecast for the second half of 2020. The digital assets industry has tremendous opportunity, and we are looking forward to capturing the opportunity of the market growth.\" Revenues were $1,392 thousand in the first half of 2020, an increase from $30 thousand in the first half of 2019. The revenues for the first half of 2020 were generated mainly from software update and maintenance services provided to a customer of our blockchain-based digital asset infrastructure solutions business. The software update project was completed in the first half of 2020. On May 21, 2019, the Company acquired Mercurity Limited (formerly known as Unicorn Investment Limited) and its subsidiaries to engage in the blockchain-based digital asset infrastructure solutions business and on July 22, 2019 divested the B2B food supply chain business. The $30 thousand revenues generated in the first half of 2019 consisted mainly of the software maintenance fees earned for the period from May 21 to June 30, 2019. Cost of revenues were $79 thousand for the first half of 2020 associated with the new blockchain-based digital asset infrastructure solutions business, compared to $38 thousand in the same period of last year primarily associated with the new business for the period from May 21 to June 30, 2019. Gross profit for the first half of 2020 was $1,313 thousand, compared to negative $8 thousand in the same period of last year. General and administrative expenses increased to $756 thousand for the first half of 2020, compared to $76 thousand in the same period of last year. The general and administrative expenses consist primarily of the staff costs, office expenses and professional fees. The increase in general and administrative expenses primarily reflected (i) the increases in staff costs and office expenses as a result of our acquisition of NBpay Investment Limited in March 2020, and (ii) the staff costs and office expenses incurred associated with business of Mercurity Limited during the six-month period in 2020 compared to those incurred for the period from May 21 to June 30, 2019 after the Company acquired Mercurity Limited. Impairment loss for the first half of 2020 was $835 thousand due to a decrease in fair value of digital assets the Company held. The Company did not incur such loss in the same period of last year. Loss from operations in the first half of 2020 was $278 thousand generated compared to a loss from operations of $84 thousand in the same period of last year. Without the intangible asset impairment, the Company had a net operating income of $530 thousand. Loss before provision for income taxes in the first half of 2020 was $305 thousand compared to a loss before provision for income taxes of $84 thousand in the same period of last year. Non-GAAP net (loss)/income attributable to Mercurity Fintech Holding Inc. is a non-GAAP measure which excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets, impairment loss, share-based compensation, and related provision for income tax expenses. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Mercurity Fintech Holding Inc. was $530 thousand in the first half of 2020 and non-GAAP net loss attributable to Mercurity Fintech Holding Inc. was $1,658 thousand in the same period of last year. Cash and cash equivalents were $388 thousand as of June 30, 2020, compared to $435 thousand as of December 31, 2019. Total shareholders' equity as of June 30, 2020 was $11.3 million, compared to total shareholders' equity of $8.0 million as of December 31, 2019. To supplement the Company's consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"U.S.GAAP\"), the Company uses non-GAAP financial measures, including Non-GAAP (loss)/income from continuing operations and Non-GAAP net (loss)/income attributable to the Company, that are adjusted from results based on U.S. GAAP to exclude amortization of acquired intangible assets, impairment loss, share-based compensation and related provision for income tax expenses. The non-GAAP financial information is provided as additional information to help investors compare business trends among different reporting periods on a consistent basis and to enhance investors' overall understanding of the historical and current financial performance of the Company's operations and prospects for the future. The non-GAAP financial information should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to U.S. GAAP financial results. In addition, the Company's calculation of this non-GAAP financial information may be different from the calculation used by other companies, and therefore comparability may be limited. A limitation of using these non-GAAP financial measures is that amortization of acquired intangible assets, impairment of goodwill, share-based compensation and related provision for income tax benefits have been and may continue to be for the foreseeable future significant recurring expenses in the Company's results of operations. The Company compensates for these limitations by providing reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to U.S. GAAP financial measures. Please see the reconciliation tables at the end of this earnings release. Due to the uncertainty as a result of global pandemic and new product development, the Company will not provide a financial forecast for the 2nd half of 2020.

    "text": "Booker T. Washington's Legacy Evolves into the Knowledge-based and Digital Economy WASHINGTON, Sept. 3, 2020 -- Booker T. Washington's historic Black trade organization, the National Business League (NBL), turned 120 years old, and celebrations will begin over the next year. On Sunday, August 23, 2020, the NBL's 120,000 members across 367 chapters worldwide celebrated the organization's steadfast commitment to the economic development of Black communities. On its 120th birthday, the NBL is poised to streamline the integration of the nation's 2.6 million black businesses into the global marketplace using technology. Black-owned businesses generate $150 billion in annual revenue in the U.S. and support 3.56 million U.S. jobs. This advanced shift into the digital age will be absolutely critical in the post-COVID-19 era, according to NBL president and CEO Ken L. Harris, Ph.D. \"Booker T. Washington's vision is more relevant today than it was 120 years ago, as a new generation of unapologetic Black leadership takes the helm,\" said Harris, president/CEO of the National Business League, Inc. \"The revolution won't be televised; it shall be digitized,\" he said. Booker T. Washington, founder of the Tuskegee Institute, organized the National Negro Business League on August 23, 1900, to promote \"commercial, agricultural, educational, financial, and industrial advancement of the Negro [sic].\" In 1966, the organization was renamed the National Business League. \"Booker T. Washington's vision was that a significant number of our people would train for, and become, captains of industry, employing millions during this time of global economic development,\" said Booker T. Washington's great-grandson, Marshall Washington-Cabiness Abuwi, Ph.D. The World Conference of Mayors, an organization engaged with 5,000 current and former mayors throughout the United States and around the world, joined the Historic Black Towns and Settlements Alliance in voting unanimously to adopt a formal declaration recognizing the National Business League as an official partner in its efforts to develop Black business and commerce-driven activity worldwide and declaring Aug. 23 an official holiday in recognition of 120 years of service. The Honorable Johnny Ford, founding president of the World Conference of Mayors, said, \"This is the beginning of a worldwide partnership unifying the Black political economy throughout the world to further develop the entrepreneurial and innovative landscape within the global marketplace.\" Booker T. Washington was also known for his ability to develop financial and political connections between the Black community and white corporate elite. Washington's close associate, Andrew Carnegie, helped Washington establish a group of corporate giants such as John D. Rockefeller, JP Morgan, John Wanamaker, and Julius Rosenwald, president of Sears, Roebuck and Co., just to name a few. These men played pivotal roles in helping the NBL to development Black businesses throughout America. \"Today, the NBL has established itself as a corporate powerhouse with more than 125 Fortune 500 companies, public and private partnerships, including the likes of Amazon, AMEX, Comcast, Comerica Bank, FIAT Chrysler, Ford, GM, Google, and Toyota, as the organization further advocates for economic equity and inclusion of Black businesses nationwide,\" said Thomas W. Dortch, Jr., NBL Board Chairman. In Booker T. Washington's last address to the league, he said, \"At the bottom of education, at the bottom of politics, even at the bottom of religion itself there must be for our race, as for all races, an economic foundation, economic prosperity, economic independence.\" The National Business League is the first and largest nonprofit, non-partisan, and non-sectarian Black business and professional trade association, which was founded on August 23, 1900, by the iconic Booker T. Washington. The NBL has more than 120,000 members nationwide, with regional offices in Atlanta, GA, Detroit, MI, Los Angeles, CA, and Washington, D.C., as well as more than 367 local league chapters across the country. The organization provides access to 2.6 million Black businesses throughout the United States. Visit www.nationalbusinessleague.org, Twitter @theNBL1900, Instagram @NBL1900, and Facebook @theNBL1900.

    "text": "SANTA CLARA, Calif., Sept. 3, 2020 -- During a time when the typical homebuying season is showing signs of slowing down, home buyers were out in full force in August, scooping up homes at a rapid pace and sending the nation's median listing price up 10% to a new record of $350,000 as the nation's inventory of for sale homes reached new lows, according to realtor.com®'s August Monthly Housing Trends report. Nationally, buyers continue to outnumber sellers as the inventory of available homes declined 36% in August year-over-year -- a faster pace than July when inventory was down 33%. New listings were down 12% year-over-year, a slight improvement over July's decline of 13%, but not nearly enough to make a dent in the overall inventory shortage. At the end of August, there were nearly 500,000 fewer homes available for sale compared to a year ago. The lack of available inventory and strong buyer demand combined to accelerate listing price growth to its highest level in three years, while the pace at which homes sold continued to pick up steam. On average, a home in the U.S. is selling in 56 days, five days faster than last year. \"It's difficult to imagine that the housing market will be able to sustain the frenzied demand we are currently experiencing, but we have yet to see any signs of slowing,\" said Danielle Hale, realtor.com® Chief Economist. \"Buyer traffic on realtor.com is outpacing the record levels we saw earlier this year, suggesting that demand will continue to exceed the number of available homes for sale. Although demand is much more intense than it normally is this late into a buying season, the typical home asking price has likely peaked for the year at $350,000. However, given the strong demand, sellers will remain in the driver's seat for the foreseeable future.\" In July, the number of homes listed for sale in the nation's 50 largest metros declined 38.1% year-over-year in August, up from the 34.8% year-over-year deficit in July. Forty four of the 50 largest metros experienced greater inventory declines than July despite an uptick in the volume of new listings in many of these same metros, underscoring just how hot the housing market is. Indianapolis-Carmel-Anderson, Ind. (-55.9%); Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario, Calif. (-55.5%); and Providence-Warwick, R.I.-Mass. (-51.7%); posted the largest inventory declines in August, while homes sold two, nine, and 10 days faster than last year in those markets, respectively. Listing prices in the nation's largest metros grew by an average of 8.9% compared to last year, up from 7.8% in July. Of the largest 50 metros, 49 saw year-over-year gains in median listing prices in August. The Northeast is leading the price gain with listing prices up nearly 19% in Philadelphia, 14.7% in Boston; and 12.2% in Providence-Warwick. On the West Coast, San Francisco saw listing prices increase 12%. The Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach market was the only metro to see a year-over-year decline, with listing prices falling 0.3% most likely due to the recent spike in Coronavirus cases and lower international buyer demand. Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington, Pa.-N.J.-Del.-Md. 18.6% -7.4% -45.1% Cincinnati, Ohio-Ky.-Ind. 17.8% -25.7% -47.7% 15.6% -25.3% -50.2% Boston-Cambridge-Newton, Mass.-N.H. 14.7% -13.1% -34.4% Kansas City, Mo.-Kan. 12.9% -29.7% -48.9% San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward, Calif. 12.3% -2.8% -12.9% Providence-Warwick, R.I.-Mass. 12.2% -15.7% -51.7% Indianapolis-Carmel-Anderson, Ind. 11.8% -27.7% -55.9% New Orleans-Metairie, La. 11.7% -27.6% -35.8% Virginia Beach-Norfolk-Newport News, Va.-N.C. 11.7% -5.2% -44.9% New York-Newark-Jersey City, N.Y.-N.J.-Pa. 11.6% 5.3% -11.9% Memphis, Tenn.-Miss.-Ark. 11.5% -23.5% -48.4% Rochester, N.Y. 11.3% -6.2% -40.0% 10.7% -8.6% -39.9% Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario, Calif. 10.6% -13.9% -55.5% Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, DC-Va.-Md.-W.

    "title": "Global Consumer Electronics Industry Gathers Pace on Spur of Consumption Upgrade",
    "url": "https://www.prnewswire.com//news-releases/global-consumer-electronics-industry-gathers-pace-on-spur-of-consumption-upgrade-301123539.html",
    "text": "BERLIN, Sept. 3, 2020 -- The global consumer electronics industry took a hit from the COVID-19 pandemic which is still raging in many parts of the world, but is gradually bottoming out and heading up as the impact on the industry fades away, driven by the \"stay-at-home economy\" and a 5G phone replacement wave. At this important junction of the industry reaching its inflection point, the 2020 IFA Product Technology Innovation Award (IFA-PTIA) unveiled its annual list of award winners that represent important product technology innovations in the industry in the year, identifying key trends of the global electronics industry in the post-pandemic era, such as 8K and QLED TVs taking the center stage, healthy home appliances achieving explosive growth, small home appliances registering strong growth despite weak market environment, and wearable devices booming again. The IFA-PTIA selection is jointly organized by International Data Group and AHK. According to the organizers, the 2020 IFA-PTIA had \"Innovating the Technology, Inspiring the Life\" as its theme and covered a full range of products representing new breakthroughs in intelligent and innovative technologies in the global consumer electronics industry, including smart home appliances, intelligent devices, wearables, AI applications, and robotics, which point to an exciting future of endless possibilities for the industry. The 2020 IFA-PTIA presented a total of 19 awards, which went to 14 brands including SIEMENS, SAMSUNG, Midea, Panasonic, BOE, Electrolux, CHiQ, HONOR, Sony, LG, PHILIPS, De'Longhi, iRobot and TECNO in recognition of their groundbreaking — in terms of technology, design or application – products. China-based global consumer electronics brands have continued to be at the forefront of innovation of the industry. Midea wins \"Smart Kitchen Solutions Gold Award\" for its new Ifamily kitchen system and \"User Experience Innovation Product Gold Award\" for its Air Conditioning KFR-35GW/BP3DN8Y-XT100(1); HONOR wins \"High-performance Innovative Laptop Gold Award\" for its MagicBook Pro and \"Outdoor Innovation Wearable Gold Award\" for its Watch GS Pro; BOE wins \"Innovative Display Technology Gold Award\" for its Flexible OLED Full-screen Display; CHiQ wins \"Design Innovation TV Gold Award\" for its 75Q7ART 8K; and TECNO wins \"Camera Technology Innovation Smartphone Gold Award\" for its CAMON 16 Premier. In the color TV space, a serious drop in the rigid demand has been the biggest challenge facing the end market in recent years. In 2020, the color TV market remains under a heavy pressure, but the entire industry has been accelerating in its transformation and shift towards diversification. For 8K TVs, for example, SAMSUNG has been a benchmark. The 2020 IFA-PTIA QLED Display Technology Gold Award went to the SAMSUNG QLED 8K Q950TS which was empowered by extensive leading technologies including QLED, HDR10+ and wide color gamut display volume to bring an indulging immersive 8K viewing experience; the 8K AI Quantum Dot processor specially developed by Samsung for the model, in particular, is capable of presenting SD, FHD and UHD/4K video contents in 8K, perfectly solving the resolution conversion issue facing sports event videos which are mostly in 2K or 4K. The CHiQ 75Q7ART 8K is a feat in design innovation thanks to the employment of CHiQ's proprietary light mixing technology and an innovative layout which achieves a superlative \"zero\" distance between the TV set and the wall; in configuration, the model boasts 8K resolution, enhanced AI image supplementation and a high-end LPDDR4 processor to deliver an incredible image quality; in addition, it offers 5GB of storage and the combination of 5G module and Wi-Fi chip for even finer image presentation and richer detail; and it also sports a premium JBL audio system that provides a rich audio experience. The COVID-19 pandemic has further raised people's health awareness and increased the demand for high-quality home appliance products with healthy features such as sterilization, purification and filtration as consumers increasingly prefer products highlighting their health and quality features. For example, the 2020 IFA-PTIA presented \"Sterilization Technology Innovation Gold Award\" to Panasonic Washing Machine NGA5E, \"Air Purification Technology Innovation Gold Award\" to Panasonic JX2 Series Air Conditioner, \"Water Purification Technology Gold Award\" to PHILIPS' AquaShield AWP1830/93 water purifier, and \"Smart Cleaning Technology Innovation Gold Award\" to iRobot's Roomba® s Series robot vacuum. All these award recipients are existing products being added new sterilization features which make them preferred choices of upgrading consumers. The air-conditioner market has also been affected by the pandemic. Confinement to their homes in the epidemic prevention and control efforts has heighted consumers' awareness of the importance of a healthy home environment, especially respiratory health which is directly related to air-conditioners. Midea's Air Conditioning KFR-35GW/BP3DN8Y-XT100(1) adopts the 180-degree rotating air duct technology applied in XT which, coupled with a large circulating air volume, solves a range of pain points such as narrow air sweeping range, high temperature in areas which cold air cannot reach, sleep mode leading to high temperature, and noisiness of other modes. Its air outlet features a curved air guide plate to create the Coanda effect by rotation, and a unibody smooth and lengthened air duct which fully rectifies airflow and effectively reduces noise to brings consumers a more comfortable breathing experience. The kitchen is expressive of people's love for their family and life, and it is also a place which young people increasingly turn to for relaxation from the pressure of work and life. In the post-pandemic era, in particular, people expect more healthy and intelligent features from their kitchen appliances which make cooking healthier, easier and quicker. In this regard, Midea Ifamily system recommends itself compellingly by comprehensively meeting these needs; it consists of three core kitchen appliances, namely stove, ventilator and dishwasher, which not only boast intelligent features but also work in linkage with each other in a way that instantly makes a beginner cook a good cook and makes cooking both pleasurable and satisfying. Besides, all the Midea products can be connected and controlled via the Midea Smart Home Meiju APP, delivering a digital and intelligent kitchen. With the advent of the 5G era, smart devices are moving towards thinness, portability and high performance. MagicBook Pro is the first of its kind in terms of \"lightness + performance\" in the large screen market. The new-generation MagicBook Pro, the world's first 16.1\" AMD Ultrabook, includes the performance mode adjustment function for the first time. In addition to the normal mode, it has the high-power mode under which the laptop offers higher power consumption restriction and fan speed for stronger performance. It meets the different needs of different users on different scenarios for performance, silence and heat dissipation. Thanks to excellent appearance and screen quality, strong performance and heat dissipation, comprehensive and balanced configuration and featured multi-screen collaborative experience. The TECNO CAMON 16 Premier is a smartphone that focuses on providing multi-dimensional camera experiences such as photography and video, Super Portrait Mode, and Professional Video Mode; its ultra-wide 105-degree selfie angle increases the viewing angle by 1.6 times compared to the traditional front-facing camera, and when there are more than three people in the selfie frame, the camera will automatically recognize and switch to the ultra-wide-angle selfie mode to make the selfie look great. It is a worthy recipient of the 2020 IFA-PTIA \"Camera Technology Innovation Smartphone Gold Award\". Steady progress in manufacturing technologies has unlocked more potential of innovation in flexible display in terms of portability and interaction, making the flexible display a key direction of smart device development. BOE not only is the world's largest LCD panel provider but also has the world's second OLED line that has been put into mass production.

The biggest highlight is its ability to be folded with the screen on and with continuous image on the screen. It is 5.4mm thick when spread and only 11mm when folded. Since the COVID-19 outbreak, consumers have paid drastically heighted attention to physical fitness and health, and this trend is set to further increase with the lifting of lockdown measures. As people take more interest in outdoor sports, the once-booming wearable market will boom again. With the iteration of sensors, AI, AR and other key technologies, wearable devices are not only coming with more diversified functions such as biometric identification, health monitoring and data transmission but also taking more diversified forms such as smart glasses, brain-controlled devices, health wearables, body motion controlled devices, and object trackers as well as now common smart watches, smart bands and smart earphones, having a huge potential of development. The HONOR Watch GS Pro, which is crowned with this year's IFA-PTIA \"Outdoor Innovation Wearable Gold Award\", is a sturdy and durable GPS smartwatch that has obtained 14 MIL-STD-810G certifications. It can withstand harsh environment such as low pressure, extreme cold, high heat, sand and dust. Watch GS Pro has over 100 work out modes and 25-day Ultra Long Battery Life.

Currently, non-invasive biopsy procedures are developed that help in sustaining the health of cancer patients. Moreover, high precision instruments and devices utilized in the process of skin biopsy have proven beneficial for segmental growth. The endometrial cancer segment's valuation was more than USD 4.7 billion in 2019. Endometrial cancer is a cancer that arises from the endometrium that is the lining of uterus or womb. It is one of the most common type of cancer of female reproductive organs. According to the American Cancer Society, endometrial cancer accounted for about 63,230 new cases and around 11,350 deaths in the U.S. in 2018. This has led to an increase in the adoption of endometrial cancer diagnostics. Cancer research institutes held over a 6.7% revenue share in 2019. Cancer research institutes are run by research scientists that carry out research and support biopharmaceutical as well as pharmaceutical companies for novel detection tests. For instance, the Cancer Research Institute located in the U.S. has around 3,100 scientists and have focused their efforts on providing solutions for the diagnosis and treatment of cancers. The cancer diagnostics market in the Asia-Pacific is expected to grow at a significant pace during the forecast timeframe, owing to the growing prevalence of cancer in the region. Increased focus of government for early detection and eradication of such diseases will escalate regional market growth. Additionally, the presence of a large patient pool in highly populous countries such as China and India are prone to various types of cancer that will favor business expansion. https://www.gminsights.com/roc/2406 A few notable companies operating in the cancer diagnostics market include Abbott, Becton, Dickinson and Company, Biocartis, Siemens Healthineers, GE Healthcare, Janssen Diagnostic LLC and Sysmex Corporation among others.

    "text": "ADVANCE, N.C., Sept. 3, 2020 -- Family Promise®, an organization that serves families with children who are currently homeless or at risk of experiencing homelessness, recently celebrated the donation of a new Clayton Built® off-site built home and welcomed a family to homeownership. This was the first of several new home donations planned this year from Family Promise and Clayton, a national builder of off-site and site-built homes. Experience the interactive Multichannel News Release here: https://www.multivu.com/players/English/84813511-clayton-family-promise-north-carolina-family-receive-new-home/ Sonya Allen, of Advance, North Carolina, and her two teenaged children, Smitty and Lanie, were forced to move out of their home after it was condemned due to water damage and mold. The family spent time in a Family Promise shelter program in Davie County, North Carolina, before moving into transitional housing after graduating Family Promise's financial program. Sonya owns family land in Advance, North Carolina, where she grew up, and had always hoped she'd be able to move back one day. By permanently placing the new off-site built home on the land, Sonya's property has the potential to appreciate over time and build equity for further stability. Now, being selected as the recipient from Family Promise for the donation of this new Clayton home, Sonya's dream of stability, security and independence has been realized. \"At Clayton we are dedicated to helping open doors to a better life through attainable homeownership,\" said Susan Brown, Director of Philanthropy at Clayton. \"Sonya and her family have overcome obstacles and worked hard to build their future, so Clayton is honored to be part of the team providing this family with the dream of homeownership.  We are very excited to witness how this family will make memories for years to come in a new home on their family land.\" The home donation is part of a larger national partnership between Clayton and Family Promise. Both organizations believe that assisting families brings the nation closer to where every family has a home, a livelihood and the chance to build a better future. Through the home donation program and A Future Begins at Home, Clayton and Family Promise provide educational outreach and resource development, comprehensive case management, support services, and affordable housing solutions for graduate families, like off-site built housing and transitional housing. \"Since we launched the A Future Begins at Home program, our partnership with Clayton has helped countless families achieve housing independence through home donations and homelessness prevention efforts,\" said Claas Ehlers, Chief Executive Officer of Family Promise National. \"We are thankful for Clayton's ongoing commitment to the fight against family homelessness, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has had a significant impact on America's low-income families.\" The transitional home Sonya and her family were previously living in is being donated by another organization to Family Promise of Davie County, where it will be used to empower even more families on their journeys to sustainable housing. The Allen's new off-site built home, constructed by Clayton and finished by Clayton Homes of Winston-Salem is an example of the many modern off-site built homes (also known as manufactured homes) available for individuals and families seeking quality homeownership. Every off-site Clayton Built® home comes with energy efficient features such as a smart programmable thermostat, energy efficient appliances and furnace to help with long-term utility savings. The Allen family's home is permanently affixed to a foundation on her property, which will give the family the potential to build equity in their property over time. Manufactured homes that are permanently attached to land have the potential to appreciate similarly to site-built homes according to the MH index from the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). The Urban Institute® reported 2018 research based on the FHFA indexes that also indicated manufactured homes may appreciate at nearly the same rate as site-built homes according to the national index, 3.4% for manufactured homes and 3.8% or site-built homes.  With the current economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, families across America are finding the dream of homeownership harder to achieve than before. Off-site built homes  offer an affordable and quality option for homeownership. Founded in 1956, Clayton is committed to opening doors to a better life and building happyness through homeownership. As a diverse builder committed to quality and durability, Clayton offers traditional site-built homes and off-site built housing – including modular homes, manufactured homes, CrossMod™ homes, tiny homes, college dormitories, military barracks and apartments. All Clayton Built® homes are proudly designed, engineered and assembled in America. In 2019, Clayton built 51,964 homes across the country. Clayton is a Berkshire Hathaway company.

Family Promise envisions a nation in which every family has a home, a livelihood, and the chance to build a better future. What began as a local initiative in Summit, NJ, has become a national movement that involves 200,000 volunteers and served more than 111,000 family members in 2019.

    "text": "MOSCOW, Sept. 3, 2020 -- PhosAgro CEO Andrey Guryev today visited the Ultramar Terminal being built at the port of Ust-Luga for the transhipment of mineral fertilizers. Mr Guryev and Andrey Bonch-Bruevich, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Ultramar, which is building the terminal, inspected the deep-water port, which will be able to receive Panamax-class vessels, one of the largest types of cargo ship in the world. In June, a freight rail link was launched that will connect to the terminal. A warehouse facility is also being built that has a storage capacity of up to 1 million tonnes of mineral fertilizers. Once construction is completed in 2021, the terminal will be the largest in Europe; in the future, it will be able to tranship up to 25 million tonnes of product per year. \"We showed our support for this project at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum in 2019, when PhosAgro and Ultramar signed a long-term agreement for transhipment through the Ultramar Terminal,\" said PhosAgro's CEO following his visit to the terminal. \"Today, we are pleased to note that the project has reached an advanced stage. The new terminal may handle the transhipment of more than 3 million tonnes of PhosAgro fertilizers per year, which will make it a crucial facility for the Company. \"As part of PhosAgro's development strategy to 2025, we plan to increase the export of fertilizers by 25 per cent, which is why we are already analysing the logistics involved in delivering additional volumes of product, as well as options for optimising current costs and diversifying the transhipment channels now being used. We are closely following the construction of the terminal in Ust-Luga, and I am confident that, once complete, it will enable us to ship steadily increasing volumes of our fertilizers in the long term.\" \"The Ultramar Terminal is a unique transhipment facility, the launch of which will eliminate the shortage of capacities needed to ship fertilizers through ports in the north-west [of Russia]\", said Mr Bonch-Bruevich. \"One of the features that will set it apart is the rate at which it can offload rail freight and load vessels. In addition, it will also provide the flexibility that mineral fertilizer producers and their customers require: the ability to store and quickly load the widest-possible range of products on individual vessels. \"The trust of our partners, and of PhosAgro first and foremost, is helping us to overcome the difficulties associated with the implementation of such a large-scale project. As of now, construction is ahead of schedule, and we expect the transhipment of PhosAgro fertilizers through the Ultramar Terminal to begin this November.\" PhosAgro (www.phosagro.com) is one of the world's leading vertically integrated phosphate-based fertilizer producers in terms of production volumes of phosphate-based fertilizers and high-grade phosphate rock with a P2O5 content of 39% and higher.

    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO, U.S. and SUZHOU, China, Sept. 3, 2020 -- Innovent Biologics, Inc. (Innovent) (HKEX: 01801), a world-class biopharmaceutical company that develops, manufactures and commercializes high quality medicines for the treatment of cancer, metabolic, autoimmune and other major diseases, today announced that SULINNO® (adalimumab injection), a recombinant human anti-TNF-α monoclonal antibody drug, has been officially approved by the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) of China for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and psoriasis in China. SULINNO® is Innovent's third monoclonal antibody drug approved by the NMPA following TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) and BYVASDA® (bevacizumab injection). The approval of SULINNO® marks the expansion of Innovent's marketed products into the non-oncology field. There are nearly 20 million patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis or psoriasis in China. Not only does this type of disease cause a decrease in these patients' physical function, life quality and social participation, but also brings heavy economic burden to their families and the society. Since the launch of adalimumab, it has been approved worldwide for the treatment of seventeen diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis, psoriasis arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, crohn's disease (including pediatric crohn's disease), ulcerative colitis, hidradenitis suppurativa, uveitis, etc. The efficacy and safety of adalimumab has been well recognized globally. Adalimumab injection is widely used in the North America and Europe. It has been consistently recommended in multiple diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines for the treatment of these diseases, and its significant efficacy has been universally recognized. However, as the cost of the injection still exceeds the affordability of many ordinary patients, the use of adalimumab remains limited in China. SULINNO®, a adalimumab biosimilar has similar clinical efficacy and safety to adalimumab, and its clinical results were published in the Inaugural Issue of The Lancet Rheumatology in 2019. The launch of SULINNO® will provide more Chinese patients with high-quality and relatively affordable adalimumab injection, bringing hope and opportunities to more patients. Dr. Michael Yu, Founder, Chairman and CEO of Innovent, stated: \"As an example of our success with the National Major New Drug Innovation and Development Projects, SULINNO® is the third monoclonal antibody drug approved by the NMPA following TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) and BYVASDA® (bevacizumab injection), and the first drug marketed among Innovent's non-oncology pipeline. The launch of SULINNO® once again fulfilled our mission to develop and commercialize high quality biopharmaceutical products that are affordable to ordinary people. We hope that this product will benefit more and more patients and families in need and improve their quality of life.\" SULINNO® is an adalimumab (Humira®) biosimilar and a recombinant human anti-TNF-α monoclonal antibody independently developed by Innovent. TNF is a proinflammatory cytokine mainly produced by activated macrophages, natural killer cells and T lymphocytes, which is involved in inflammatory and immune responses. Anti-TNF-α antibody can bind to human TNF-α monomer or trimer, block TNF-α binding to the cellular surface receptor, p55 and p75, and neutralize the cytotoxic effect of TNF-α, thereby inhibiting the release of TNF-α mediated inflammatory factors and cytokines, the adhesion and infiltration of inflammatory cells, the proliferation of fibroblasts and the activation of osteoclasts. Since the launch of adalimumab, it has been approved globally for the treatment of seventeen diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis, psoriasis arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, crohn's disease (including pediatric crohn's disease), ulcerative colitis, hidradenitis suppurativa, uveitis, etc., and its efficacy and safety has been well recognized worldwide. The results of a complete pre-clinical comparison showed that SULINNO® has similar in vitro biological activity (binding activity to target antigen TNF-α and neutralizing activity), physicochemical property and pharmacokinetic characteristics to those of Humira®. The similarities were also demonstrated in pharmacological and toxicological studies. The head-to-head clinical study comparing SULINNO® and Humira® conducted in patients with ankylosing spondylitis demonstrated a clinical similarity. The study results were published at Inaugural Issue of The Lancet Rheumatology in 2019. Inspired by the spirit of \"Start with Integrity, Succeed through Action,\" Innovent's mission is to develop and commercialize high quality biopharmaceutical products that are affordable to ordinary people. Established in 2011, Innovent is committed to developing, manufacturing and commercializing high quality innovative medicines for the treatment of cancer, metabolic, autoimmune and other major diseases. On October 31, 2018, Innovent was listed on the Main Board of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited with the stock code: 01801.HK. Since its inception, Innovent has developed a fully-integrated multi-functional platform which includes R&D, CMC (Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls), clinical development and commercialization capabilities. Leveraging the platform, the company has built a robust pipeline of 23 valuable assets in the fields of cancer, metabolic, autoimmune diseases and other major therapeutic areas, with 3 products, TYVYT® (sintilimab injection), BYVASDA® (bevacizumab injection) and SULINNO® (adalimumab injection), on market, 1 asset under NDA review with priority review status, 4 assets in Phase III or pivotal clinical trials, and additional 15 molecules in or close to clinical trials. TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) has been the only PD-1 inhibitor included in the NRDL since 2019. Innovent has built an international team with expertise in cutting-edge biological drug development and commercialization. The company has also entered into strategic collaborations with Eli Lilly, Adimab, Incyte, Alector, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Hanmi and other international partners.

    "url": "https://www.prnewswire.com//news-releases/vehicle-electrification-market-worth-129-6-billion-by-2025--exclusive-report-by-marketsandmarkets-301123726.html",
    "text": "CHICAGO, Sept. 3, 2020 -- According to the new market research report \"Vehicle Electrification Market by Product (Start-Stop, PTC, EPS, Electric Air Conditioner, ISG, Starter Motor, Alternator, Actuator, Electric Pump-Vacuum, Oil & Water), 48V, ICE, BEV, HEV, PHEV, Vehicle Type, and Region - Global Forecast to 2025\", published by MarketsandMarkets™, the Vehicle Electrification Market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 11.9% to reach USD 129.6 billion by 2025 from USD 73.7 billion. Owing to various benefits offered by electrification such as decreased vehicle weight, lower emissions, increased fuel efficiency, improved driving comfort, and safety among, vehicle electrification would be a preferred option by OEMs in the near future. Download PDF Brochure: https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/pdfdownloadNew.asp?id=224946587 Electrification of a vehicle is considered the best way to reduce carbon emissions, increase vehicle efficiency, and reduce dependency on oil. Vehicle electrification generates newer opportunities for consumer engagement, along with various environmental and economic benefits. The production of passenger cars is very high compared to other vehicle types. The production of passenger cars in Asia Oceania is the highest with more than 49 million units, followed by Europe with more than 18 million units. According to MarketsandMarkets™ analysis, Europe is estimated to have a 45.5% share of the total 48V vehicle market in 2019. Developed infrastructure such as charging stations, limited range of present day BEVs, and high cost of HEVs and PHEVs are the few reasons why 48V vehicles are preferred over hybrid vehicles in Europe. This trend is estimated to continue for the next 10 years. The 48V system consists of a 48V Li-ion battery, DC/DC converter, and an integrated starter generator (ISG). Without replacing the present 12V architecture completely, 48V architecture can work parallelly with the combustion engine and regular 12V battery. This parallel combination helps boost the efficiency of electric parts like electrical oil, coolant, and vacuum pump. Considering the fact that emission norms in Europe are very strict, 48V vehicle is expected to hold a significant market in the near future. Request Free Sample Report: https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/requestsampleNew.asp?id=224946587 The North American Vehicle Electrification Market has a very positive outlook, owing to effective infrastructure and tax exemption, subsidies, and special facilities provided by governments of different countries in the region. The US is set to dominate the North American Vehicle Electrification Market in 2019. As the country has the presence of major OEMs and Tier I players, adoption of electric components in ICE vehicles, BEVs, HEVs, and PHEVs is very high.

    "url": "https://www.prnewswire.com//news-releases/strategies-technologies--products-of-leading-tier-1-suppliers-of-intelligent-cockpit-2020-report-301122929.html",
    "text": "DUBLIN, Sept. 3, 2020 -- The \"Global and China Leading Tier 1 Suppliers' Intelligent Cockpit Business Research Report, 2020 (I)\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. Leading Tier 1 Suppliers' Cockpit Business Research Report: Eight Development Trends of Intelligent CockpitAbstract: in the next two or three years, a range of new intelligent cockpit technologies will be in place and mounted on vehicles, according to the Global and China Leading Tier 1 Suppliers' Intelligent Cockpit Business Research Report.High automation faces technical and regulation challenges and it takes a long period of time to build 5G network and roadside infrastructure. In this context, much enthusiasm for intelligent cockpit is being aroused before automated driving technology becomes mature enough. Intelligent cockpits featuring new design concept draw more attention from consumers than automated driving technology does.Globally, OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers are racing to explore how to launch new intelligent cockpit technologies. The publisher expects that numerous intelligent cockpit products will be launched successively in the upcoming two years or three.Based on the picture at CES 2020, development trends for intelligent cockpit can be seen below:(1) Cockpit domain control unit (DCU): next-generation intelligent cockpit systems are DCU-centric and enable features of cockpit electronic systems through a unified software and hardware platform, which incorporate intelligent interaction, intelligent scenarios and personalized services and serve as the foundation for human-vehicle interaction and V2X connectivity.(2) Multi-display interaction: the cockpit design of dual-display interaction (center console, dashboard), four-display interaction (center console, dashboard, entertainment screen at the copilot's seat, vehicle control display), or even five-display interaction (center console, dashboard, entertainment screen at the copilot's seat, vehicle control display, rear seat entertainment display) is trending. Multi-display interaction needs complete cockpit domain architecture, and fusion of technologies, e.g., cockpit DCU, multi-chip (like TI automotive chips and Qualcomm entertainment chip), multiple operating systems (Linux, Android Automotive), Hypervisor virtualization technology, interaction logic, and HMI design. Tier 1 suppliers are required to be more competent in product development and technology integration while seeking business growth amid the rising average selling price (ASP) of intelligent cockpit per vehicle.(3) Cockpit virtualization technology (separate development of software and hardware): virtual prototyping technology makes design, R&D and test of intelligent vehicles more efficient. Virtualizer Development Kit (VDK) based on virtual prototyping technology enables virtual simulation of electronic control units (ECU), e.g., chips, circuits and components. Automakers can commence development and test of software twelve months ahead of time before the availability of hardware, upgrading physical development to intelligent development in simulation environment. Also, ECUs for virtual simulation can accelerate and extend tests, and simulate various tests in extreme conditions, which is hard to achieve in real and physical circumstances and which secures faster roll-out of safer and more reliable products into market. The virtual prototyping technology is applicable to virtual development and test of all complex electronic systems such as intelligent cockpit and ADAS.(4) Higher value of cockpit electronics software: the more complex vehicle system software means it makes up ever more of the total cost of a vehicle. OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers are expanding software developers in R&D workforce. Examples include Desay SV, an intelligent cockpit bellwether in China, which boasted about 1,300 software engineers in 2019, a 70% share of its headcount; and Bosch in possession of 30,000 software talents, or 41% of the total staff in 2019 endeavoring to recruit more software developers. Between 2019 and 2020, Bosch set up Bosch China Innovation and Software R&D Center and Bosch Digital Cabin (Shanghai) R&D Center.(5) Cockpit terminal-cloud integration, T-BOX and V2X as gateway of data from inside and outside vehicle, and cockpit big data as core competitive edge of products: intelligent cockpit will be a combination of terminals and cloud, in which all kinds of service contents, timely information sharing and complex computation will be offered and done over cloud, more than acts as a stand-alone terminal. In future cockpit big data will be the core competitive edge of products, making center console and dashboard, center information display (CID) navigation, T-BOX and air-conditioner controller, integrated.(6) Evolution of vehicle display from flat rectangular screen to large curved screen: in January 2020, Corning's high-performance Gorilla cold-rolled glass was first available to GAC Aion LX; in early 2020, Visteon and Corning joined hands to further develop ColdForm technology which will be spawned by Corning for automotive curved display systems; in July 2020, Rightware under Thundersoft, and LG Electronics partnered to develop the industry's first curved OLED display for 2021 Cadillac Escalade.(7) Glasses-free 3D display: 3D effect makes eyes capture information more quickly. Bosch, Continental and more all focus on mass production and installation of glasses-free 3D displays in the next two year or three. At CES 2020, Continental showcased its 3D Lightfield display technology which was co-developed with Leia Inc. and mass production is arranged in 2022.(8) Driver monitoring system (DMS) or interior monitoring system (IMS): IMS based on camera and AI is the core product of Tier 1 suppliers. DMS will play a crucial role in whether a new vehicle model can be rated five stars by Euro NCAP. For example, Continental plans to mass-produce DMS in 2021 and Bosch in 2022.Key Topics Covered 1.

    "title": "Kingfisher selects MRI Software's lease accounting solution for effective IFRS 16 reporting",
    "url": "https://www.prnewswire.com//news-releases/kingfisher-selects-mri-softwares-lease-accounting-solution-for-effective-ifrs-16-reporting-301123182.html",
    "text": "LONDON, Sept. 3, 2020 -- Kingfisher plc is an international home improvement company with over 1,300 stores in nine countries across Europe, Russia and Turkey, supported by a team of over 77,000 colleagues. They operate under retail brands including B&Q, Castorama, Brico Dépôt, Screwfix and Koçtaş. Across its brands, Kingfisher has embarked on a unification programme to consolidate its product range and reduce its cost base. That project required the company to take a fresh look at how it uses technology to manage various aspects of its business – including its lease accounting processes. With the digital transformation project under way, then came the requirement to transition to the new IFRS 16 accounting standards and recognise lease commitments on the company balance sheet. It soon became clear that existing manual methods and reliance on a cumbersome spreadsheet would be inefficient and risk inaccuracies, so Kingfisher began searching the market for a software-based IFRS 16 calculation tool. With IFRS 16 representing a long-term and significant shift in the way lease accounting happens, Kingfisher was committed to properly addressing and resourcing their new way of reporting. Following a rigorous procurement process, they decided to implement MRI Horizon for its powerful IFRS 16 lease accounting functionality. The Kingfisher team was impressed with the value proposition and the consultative nature of the engagements – working closely and interacting with the MRI Software team throughout. They also sought opinions from other finance leaders at fellow retail organisations using the Horizon solution, gaining confidence that the application is proven in the sector. \"The impact of IFRS 16 is massive, and the volume of leases we manage required a strategic and comprehensive approach. Horizon ticked all the boxes we were looking for, and helped us get ahead of the curve.\" Nick Wilding, Group Finance Systems Manager, Kingfisher plc Kingfisher is now relying on Horizon for IFRS 16 reporting across its group, and is utilising the solution to quickly, efficiently and accurately demonstrate the impact of leases on its financial performance. Technology partnership – Kingfisher gave the green light on Horizon six months before it needed to report on the new standards, and MRI Software was able to consistently support tight deadlines and call on experience gained from helping hundreds of retail brands transition to IFRS 16. Efficiency – As a SaaS-based application, Horizon was implemented quickly and required limited IT effort on the client side to get out of the ground. It is easy to use and agile – but still an enterprise-grade platform that supports Kingfisher's large portfolio and multi-region requirements. Visibility – The Kingfisher finance team is able to look at detailed information on a lease in one software application and run reports – a process that previously required great effort and manual work in Excel. Horizon is also enabling much quicker calculation of the group impact of leases, and can be relied on to run reports that give auditors easy access to the information they need. Scalability and integration – Having initially adopted the solution for IFRS 16 calculations on property leases, Kingfisher is now exploring the potential benefits of Horizon across other operational aspects of its business. MRI's commitment to flexibility and integration provides a platform for the team to upgrade or add new components as and when needed – discussed and executed as part of an ongoing and collaborative business partnership. MRI Software is a leading provider of innovative real estate software applications and hosted solutions. MRI's comprehensive and flexible technology platform coupled with an open and connected ecosystem meets the unique needs of real estate businesses – from property-level management and accounting to investment modelling and analytics for the global commercial and residential markets.

    "url": "https://www.prnewswire.com//news-releases/plastics-to-fuel-market-projected-to-exceed-590-million-by-2026-says-global-market-insights-inc-301123230.html",
    "text": "The growth of the plastics-to fuel market is attributed to the proliferation of top-quality and sustainable fuel across end-user industries throughout the globe, says this report. SELBYVILLE, Del., Sept. 3, 2020 -- Based on Global Market Insights Inc., report, the plastics-to-fuel market valuation is slated to surpass $590 million by 2026. The report provides a detailed analysis of the competitive scenarios, major winning strategies, key investment avenues, wavering industry trends, market estimations as well as size, and drivers, and opportunities. Ongoing technological advancement in recycling and waste disposal has created an immense opportunity for the plastics-to-fuel market in recent years. Counties like Turkey, India, Saudi Arabia, have set a goal for reducing their carbon footprint substantially by 2030. Subsequently, these trends have been boosting the demand for pyrolysis oil in the fuel manufacturing industry. Ongoing technological advancement in recycling and waste disposal has created an immense opportunity for the plastics-to-fuel market in recent years. Counties like Turkey, India, Saudi Arabia, have set a goal for reducing their carbon footprint substantially by 2030. Subsequently, these trends have been boosting the demand for pyrolysis oil in the fuel manufacturing industry. Based on the source, the other source segment which includes agriculture waste, e-waste, medical waste among others will foresee nearly 2.5% CAGR over the forecast time frame. Countries like Malaysia and Indonesia will account for over 60% of the waste produced from these sources, further resulting in a huge amount of open dumping of wastes and landfilling due to the lack of appropriate waste management processes. This will provide a massive opportunity for plastics-to-fuel market manufacturers over the coming years. Request a Sample Report: https://www.gminsights.com/request-sample/detail/4804 The catalytic degradation segment is likely to generate revenue of approximately $50 million by the end of the analysis timeline. Depolymerization method selection is mostly dependent on the need for fuel type. Essentially, catalytic degradation improves process efficiency since it decreases the energy consumption rate for converting plastic waste into fuel. North America is likely to account for nearly 20% share of the overall plastics-to-fuel market share. This can be majorly ascribed to higher recycling and WtE (waste-to-energy) recovery rate in the U.S. The country, in 2017, generated approximately 250 million tons of waste, out of which approximately 12% was used to produce energy and 25% was recycled. However, WtE and high recycling rates are still not being used on a full scale, indicating immense untapped potential. The Asia Pacific plastics-to-fuel market is expected to account for around 20% share in the overall market. Countries like Japan and South Korea have registered a substantial energy recovery rate from waste material in the past few years. South Korea has further planned on increasing its recycling rate from 34% to 70% by 2030. Though, the country is still very much dependent on a number of foreign imports for the conversion of plastic waste into fuel. Likewise, this has formed a drop in price and demand for domestic plastic waste in the last few years. Request customization of this report: https://www.gminsights.com/roc/4804 Recycling firms find it difficult to process contaminated wastes into goods due to higher expenditure on processing and collection. Such trends have further helped the governments to subsidize these enterprises for promoting the consumption of domestic waste in recycling. Consequently, a well-established base for waste recovery and recycling coupled with supportive government policies will boost the plastics-to-fuel market demand across the region. Market players analyzed in the plastics-to-fuel industry report include Plastic2Oil, Inc., Neste, CBS Technologies, Klean Industries, POLCYL, and Nexus Fuel among many others. They have incorporated several strategies including partnership, expansion, collaboration, joint ventures, and others to heighten their stand in the industry. About Global Market Insights, Inc.

    "text": "LONDON, Sept. 3, 2020 -- North Wales-based local authority, Wrexham County Borough Council, is using capital accounting software from Real Asset Management (RAM), an MRI Software Company to manage and track its 3,500+ assets worth more than £1 billion. The solution provides the Council with the detailed functionality required for IFRS compliance, as well as creating a robust audit trail and increasing back-office efficiencies. With a cash limited budget of £250 million and approximately 6,000 employees, the Council provides Wrexham and its surrounding areas with advice and services on such things as housing, social care and education, and serves a population of approximately 135,000 people. Key drivers for selecting RAM's capital accounting software included having access to reliable and intelligently designed functionality as well as a journal output for financial ledger entries. Karl Griffiths, Finance Business Partner at Wrexham County Borough Council comments, \"Prior to purchasing the RAM software we used spreadsheets to manage our capital assets which were time-consuming and prone to error. It was proving to be a lengthy process using complex formulae which made it very difficult to maintain and ensure consistency for audits.\" The Council uses RAM's centralised asset register to record detailed information on such assets as its land and buildings, infrastructure, vehicles and equipment. It provides the means of storing and managing all of its fixed asset data, controlling each asset at component level and providing highly accurate and reliable depreciation calculations. Of particular benefit to Wrexham County Borough Council is the functionality to record and report on in-financial year movement regarding assets such as revaluations, impairments, additions and disposals. The RAM system generates the management information and relevant journal entries to reflect these activities in an easy and timely manner. RAM's capital accounting software has provided the Council with solid efficiencies throughout its closedown and audit period. Griffiths explained, \"Thanks to the levels of automation provided by RAM's system, the auditing process is much more straightforward now, as checks take less time and our auditors have the assurance that the system can be relied upon for maintaining accurate records. \"I couldn't imagine trying to complete our financial year-end without the RAM system. From the flexibility and speed of reporting to the accurate financial calculations, we have achieved invaluable time and resource efficiencies.\" Griffiths concluded, \"We selected the system from RAM due to its excellent reputation amongst existing users in local authorities across the UK and we have not been disappointed. We have a secure and robust system which is specifically tailored to meet the Council's needs, as well as access to an excellent technical support team who are always helpful, professional and courteous.\" Real Asset Management (RAM), an MRI Software Company, is a leading provider of fixed asset management and logistics software & services. Over the last 30 years, its products have been implemented at thousands of customer sites worldwide.

    "text": "OXFORD, England, Sept. 3, 2020 -- Enesi Pharma (\"Enesi\"), an innovative biotechnology company developing next-generation vaccination products targeting serious diseases, is delighted to announce its partnership with the University of Adelaide to develop a new thermostable, solid dose DNA vaccine for Zika virus to prevent infection of pregnant women and the resultant congenital effects in the unborn child. This project aims to employ Enesi's ImplaVax® formulation expertise and platform to create a protective Zika virus DNA vaccine in a solid dose implant format for transcutaneous delivery via a needle-free device. The innovative combination of this ImplaVax® formulation and delivery system with the novel DNA vaccine construct developed by researchers at the University of Adelaide is expected to enhance the vaccine's efficacy, thermal stability and allow for safe and rapid vaccination of target populations that are otherwise geographically and economically disadvantaged. DNA and RNA vaccines are becoming increasingly prominent and hold great potential against many diseases, as highlighted by the ongoing Covid-19 crisis. However, they also present important thermostability challenges and require an uninterrupted end-to-end cold chain throughout to maintain potency up to the point of administration. Enesi's ImplaVax® technology aims to address these challenges by creating needle-free solid dose vaccines that are thermally stable at temperatures up to 40oC and eliminate the need for cold-chain storage and distribution. The new AUD1.35 million collaboration with the University of Adelaide aims to advance the development of a novel thermostable, solid dose Zika virus DNA vaccine to Phase 1 clinical trials. The programme is being funded with AUD675,500 from the Australian Government's Biomedical Translation Bridge (BTB) programme, and additional funding from Enesi Pharma, The Hospital Research Foundation, Adelaide Enterprise Commercial Accelerator Scheme and the University of Adelaide's Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences. \"We are delighted to enter this new partnership with the University of Adelaide, and to leverage our ImplaVax® technologies to tackle the significant public health issue that Zika virus infection represents. We are particularly excited that this new collaboration is focused on advancing the development of a solid dose DNA vaccine through application of our ImplaVax® technology. While holding huge promise, it is recognised that DNA and RNA vaccines have significant cold chain requirements, which could impact the efficiency and reach of final products. \"We believe that our ImplaVax® technology could provide a solution to overcome these barriers. This belief is based upon our earlier work which has evidenced the ability for ImplaVax®-enabled DNA vaccine candidates to be thermally stable and retain their immunogenicity potential. A positive outcome from our new collaboration, alongside other projects evaluating ImplaVax®-enabled DNA and RNA vaccines, could help unlock the full potential of such approaches across a vast range of diseases, from Zika to Covid-19.\" Zika is a mosquito-transmitted 'flavivirus' currently circulating in the Americas and Asia, which causes microcephaly (a birth defect where a baby's head is significantly smaller than expected) and other severe birth defects in infants born to infected mothers. These defects cannot be corrected, and the accompanying disabilities are lifelong and catastrophic. Zika can also cause Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults, and there is currently no therapy or approved vaccine available to prevent infection. The Australian Government's Biomedical Translation Bridge program, delivered by Australia's Industry Growth Centre, MTPConnect, is an initiative of the Medical Research Future Fund, and aims to facilitate the translation of new therapies, technologies and medical devices through to the proof of concept stage. Enesi Pharma is developing next-generation vaccination products targeting serious diseases affecting people around the world. We work in partnership with global companies, government agencies, leading academic institutions and non-governmental organisations with the goal of making a positive impact on global health. Our ImplaVax®-enabled vaccination products leverage our innovative rapidly dispersing solid-dose formulation and needle-free delivery technologies and are applicable across all vaccine formats. ImplaVax® products are designed to enhance the immune response and offer significant benefits for patients, care givers, healthcare professionals and payers through enhanced effectiveness, safety, ease of use, reliability and stability, and a strong subject preference over administration using needle and syringe. They can be administered with minimal training and are also rapidly deployable while eliminating the need for cold-chain storage. Our pipeline targets a range of common and emerging infectious diseases, inflammatory diseases and allergies, and has been established through collaborations with world-class organisations, including BARDA DRIVe*, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Innovate UK, the University of Oxford, and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research . Enesi's experienced leadership team has a proven track record in the successful development and commercialisation of innovative products delivering high value outcomes for all stakeholders and is supported by a world-renowned Scientific Advisory Board.

    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 3, 2020 -- The global recruitment process outsourcing market size is expected to reach USD 20.8 billion by 2027, registering a CAGR of 18.5% over the forecast period, according to a new report by Grand View Research, Inc. The rising demand for streamlined recruitment processes and new hiring methodologies have augmented the growth prospects of the Recruitment Process Outsourcing (RPO) market. The emergence of the digital recruitment strategy is expected to provide a new horizon to hiring processes in terms of creating requirements that stand out, improved career site interference, and an efficient user interface. In the coming decades, technology is expected to play a vital role in enhancing the recruitment process. HR automation is paving the way for a new age of recruitment by innovating hiring solutions across organizations. Many organizations are already using Artificial Intelligence (AI) for sourcing and screening candidates. The use of such advancements reduces human errors, manual workload, and smoothens the overall HR process. Moreover, the use of data-driven tools, mobile application platforms, and social media recruitment marketing simplifies the hiring process. Read 124 page research report with ToC on \"Recruitment Process Outsourcing Market Size, Share & Trends Analysis Report By Type (On-demand, Enterprise), By Service (On-site, Off-site), By Enterprise Size, By End Use, And Segment Forecasts, 2020 - 2027\" at: https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/recruitment-process-outsourcing-rpo-market With the evolving relationship between Recruitment Process Outsourcing (RPO) providers and organizations, the complete talent solution is likely to become the main focus of the organization. RPO is not just limited to hiring people but also includes the management of people, processes, technology, and the talent acquisition strategy. RPO offers exceptional communication experience to the candidate by providing consistent, transparent, and honest feedback that can help the organization's reputation sterling. It also helps in amplifying the employer brand of the organization. North America and Europe dominated the RPO market, whereas South America and the Middle East regions occupied relatively smaller revenue share, in 2019. Factors such as economic crisis, currency depreciation, and language barriers limit the growth of outsourced hiring activities in South America. Most employers in the Middle East have their in-house recruitment teams and RPO is yet to make inroads in the region. However, the current market scenario is expected to change in these regions owing to international brands entering the regional market. Real-estate and mega construction projects in the Middle East are expected to provide significant traction to the RPO market growth in the near future.

    "text": "BEIJING, Sept. 3, 2020 -- Momo Inc. (NASDAQ: MOMO) (\"Momo\" or the \"Company\"), a leading mobile social networking platform in China, today announced its unaudited financial results for the second quarter of 2020. * This press release contains translations of certain Renminbi amounts into U.S. dollars at specified rates solely for the convenience of readers. Unless otherwise noted, all translations from Renminbi to U.S. dollars, in this press release, were made at a rate of RMB7.0651 to US$1.00, the effective noon buying rate for June 30, 2020 as set forth in the H.10 statistical release of the Federal Reserve Board. \"The second quarter of 2020 was a busy quarter for us. With things gradually coming back to normal on the traffic side, starting from the second quarter of 2020, our teams have stepped up efforts to push toward our long term strategic goals.\" commented Yan Tang, Chairman and CEO of Momo. \"I am glad to see that Tantan has reached a breakthrough with its testing of live video service. With the strength coming from Tantan and the value-added service on the core Momo, we can now focus more on driving structural changes to the core live broadcasting business so that it can grow healthily and steadily in the new macro environment.\" Total net revenues were RMB3,868.3 million (US$547.5 million) in the second quarter of 2020, a decrease of 6.8% from RMB4,152.6 million in the second quarter of 2019. Live video service revenues were RMB2,602.9 million (US$368.4 million) in the second quarter of 2020, a decrease of 16% from RMB3,099.9 million during the same period of 2019. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of COVID-19 adversely affecting the sentiment of our paying users, especially among the top of the pyramid paying users. Meanwhile, Tantan has been accelerating the testing of its live video service since the middle of April, and live video service revenues from Tantan were 191.7 million (US$27.1 million) in the second quarter of 2020. Value-added service revenues mainly include virtual gift revenues and membership subscription revenues. Total value-added service revenues were RMB1,204.3 million (US$170.5 million) in the second quarter of 2020, an increase of 27% from RMB948.4 million during the same period of 2019. The year-over-year increase was primarily attributable to the continued growth of the virtual gift business on the Momo application driven by more innovative features launched and more paying scenarios introduced to enhance the social entertainment experience of Momo users, and to a lesser extent, the increase in the membership subscription revenues of Tantan. Mobile marketing revenues were RMB38.0 million (US$5.4 million) in the second quarter of 2020, a decrease of 50% from RMB76.2 million during the same period of 2019. The decrease in mobile marketing revenues was primarily caused by the decreased demand from our advertising and marketing customers as well as our strategy to underweight the line in terms of resource allocation. Mobile games revenues were RMB11.6 million (US$1.6 million) in the second quarter of 2020, a decrease of 50% from RMB23.2 million in the second quarter of 2019. The decrease in mobile game revenues was mainly due to the continued decrease in quarterly paying users of mobile games. Net revenues from Momo segment decreased from RMB3,865.4 million in the second quarter of 2019 to RMB3,340.7 million (US$472.8 million) in the second quarter of 2020, primarily due to the decrease in net revenues from live video service, partially offset by the increase in net revenues from value-added service. Net revenues from Tantan segment increased from RMB284.8 million in the second quarter of 2019 to RMB517.2 million (US$73.2 million) in the second quarter of 2020, which was mainly due to the increase in net revenues from live video service. Cost and expenses were RMB3,146.9 million (US$445.4 million) in the second quarter of 2020, a decrease of 7.1% from RMB3,386.8 million in the second quarter of 2019. The decrease was primarily attributable to: (a) a decrease in share-based compensation expenses due to the related expense from the options granted to Tantan's founders in the amount of RMB323.7 million charged in the second quarter of 2019 when the necessary performance conditions were satisfied; (b) a decrease in revenue sharing with broadcasters related to our live video service. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in marketing and promotional expenses to attract users on Tantan, and an increase in revenue sharing with virtual gift recipients for our virtual gift service. Non-GAAP cost and expenses (note 1) were RMB2,923.7 million (US$413.8 million) in the second quarter of 2020, an increase of 2.0% from RMB2,866.7 million during the same period of 2019. Other operating income was RMB91.3 million (US$12.9 million) in the second quarter of 2020, a decrease from RMB161.9 million during the second quarter of 2019. The decrease was mainly due to less government incentives received in the second quarter of 2020. Income from operations was RMB812.7 million (US$115.0 million) in the second quarter of 2020, compared to RMB927.7 million during the same period of 2019. Income from operations of Momo segment was RMB945.3 million (US$133.8 million) in the second quarter of 2020, decreasing from RMB1,354.4 million in the second quarter of 2019. Loss from operations of Tantan segment was RMB125.6 million (US$17.8 million) in the second quarter of 2020, compared to loss from operations of RMB431.4 million in the second quarter of 2019. Non-GAAP income from operations (note 1) was RMB1,035.8 million (US$146.6 million) in the second quarter of 2020, compared to RMB1,447.9 million during the same period of 2019. Non-GAAP income from operations of Momo segment was RMB1,102.6 million (US$156.1 million) in the second quarter of 2020, decreasing from RMB1,488.5 million in the second quarter of 2019. Non-GAAP loss from operations of Tantan segment was RMB62.4 million (US$8.8 million) in the second quarter of 2020, compared to non-GAAP loss from operations of RMB47.9 million in the second quarter of 2019. Income tax expenses were RMB443.6 million (US$62.8 million) in the second quarter of 2020, increasing from RMB283.9 million in the second quarter of 2019. The increase in income tax expenses was mainly due to the payment of withholding income tax of 10% on dividends distributed by our wholly-foreign owned enterprise (\"WFOE\") in China to our offshore entity in the second quarter of 2020. The dividends of RMB2,200.0 million (US$311.4 million) and withholding income tax of RMB220.0 million (US$31.1 million) were paid in the second quarter of 2020. Net income was RMB455.5 million (US$64.5 million) in the second quarter of 2020, compared to RMB731.1 million during the same period of 2019.

On September 3, 2020, Momo's board of directors authorized a share repurchase program under which the Company may repurchase up to US$300 million of its shares over the next 12 months. The Company's proposed repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market at prevailing market prices, in privately negotiated transactions, in block trades and/or through other legally permissible means, depending on market conditions and in accordance with applicable rules and regulations. The Company's board of directors will review the share repurchase program periodically, and may authorize adjustment of its terms and size. The timing and conditions of the share repurchases will be subject to various factors, including the requirements under Rule 10b-18 and Rule 10b5-1 promulgated pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Company plans to fund repurchases from its existing cash balance. For the third quarter of 2020, the Company expects total net revenues to be between RMB3.7 billion to RMB3.8 billion, representing a decrease of 16.9% to 14.6% year over year.

To supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), we use various non-GAAP financial measures that are adjusted from the most comparable GAAP results to exclude share-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets from business acquisitions, and tax impacts related to the amortization of intangible assets from business acquisitions. Reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to our U.S. GAAP financial measures are shown in tables at the end of this earnings release, which provide more details about the non-GAAP financial measures. Our non-GAAP financial information is provided as additional information to help investors compare business trends among different reporting periods on a consistent basis and to enhance investors' overall understanding of the historical and current financial performance of our continuing operations and our prospects for the future. Our non-GAAP financial information should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to the GAAP results. In addition, our calculation of the non-GAAP financial measures may be different from the calculation used by other companies, and therefore comparability may be limited. Our non-GAAP information (including non-GAAP cost and operating expenses, income (loss) from operations, net income (loss)，net income attributable to Momo Inc., and diluted net income per ADS) is adjusted from the most comparable GAAP results to exclude share-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets from business acquisitions, and tax impacts related to the amortization of intangible assets from business acquisitions. A limitation of using these non-GAAP financial measures is that share-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets from business acquisitions and tax impacts related to the amortization of intangible assets from business acquisitions have been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in our results of operations. We compensate for these limitations by providing reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to our U.S. GAAP measures. Please see the reconciliation tables at the end of this earnings release.

His leadership experience makes Steen an ideal candidate to lead Amarna into its next stage of growth and development,\" said Thomas Eldered, Chairman of Amarna's Supervisory Board. \"We are extremely grateful for Ben van Leent's leadership and contributions to Amarna as both founder and CEO, and we are excited about the opportunity to focus his outstanding expertise as member of our Board.\" \"I am incredibly honored to have been given the opportunity to lead Amarna,\" said Dr. Klysner. \"SVec has the potential to enable major medical breakthroughs, so that patients can be actually cured of life-threatening diseases for which, to date, effective treatment have not become available. Together with Amarna's highly qualified and experienced team, I'm fully committed to advance the company's groundbreaking technology into the next important clinical development stages.\" Steen Klysner comes to Amarna with over 30 years of experience in the life sciences industry. Prior to joining Amarna, Dr. Klysner served as CEO of the Swedish ExpreS2ion Biotech Holding AB in parallel with the Danish ExpreS2ion Biotechnologies ApS. Earlier, he was Senior Vice President (SVP) of preclinical R&D and SVP of Quality of Allergopharma, the Allergy Business Unit of Merck KGaA. He also served as CEO of Nordic Vaccine in Copenhagen, focusing on the development of non-invasive vaccination based on an integrated nanoparticle adjuvant and delivery platform. Prior to that he has also held positions at Pharmexa, Novo Nordisk and ALK. Dr. Klysner holds a Ph.D. from Technical University of Denmark combined with an Industrial Scientist Research Degree from the Danish \"Academy of Technical Sciences\", a M.Sc. degree in Biochemistry from the University of Copenhagen and a B.Sc. in sports from the University of Copenhagen. Finally, Dr. Klysner is author/co-author of numerous patents and scientific publications in (inter)-national peer-reviewed medical journals. \"I am deeply grateful to have had the opportunity to build Amarna to where it is today. In my new role as member of the Supervisory Board, my efforts will be towards helping raise the awareness of Amarna and its SVec gene delivery vector platform and using it to help build a robust pipeline,\" said Ben van Leent. \"I have full confidence that Steen, a very passionate and talented leader, will provide the leadership and expertise needed to guide Amarna through the next phases of growth. I look forward to working with Steen to drive forward Amarna's product candidates.\" Today gene therapy enables the development of a next wave of treatments, with potential to not only treat, but also to cure a number of major diseases. Key to the success of gene therapy is the efficient delivery of therapeutic genes into target cells, which is an ability that naturally evolved in viruses, rendering them ideally suited for gene delivery. The Simian virus 40 (SV40) strictly replicates in its natural host, macaque monkeys. The virus cannot replicate in humans and doesn't elicit an immune response, which makes it ideal for developing effective gene therapies. However, the clinical use of SV40 vectors has been hampered by production and safety issues. Amarna has solved this, by developing a novel proprietary SuperVero™ production cell line and the SVec™ gene delivery platform. Importantly, SVec™ can be used to efficiently induce immune tolerance to self-antigens driving degenerative, inflammatory and autoimmune human diseases. Amarna aims to develop SVec-based \"reverse\" vaccines for major indications such as neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases (NDPs), atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ACD), obesity, diabetes mellitus (DM), arthritis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Amarna Therapeutics is a privately held Biotech company founded in 2008. Its head office is located in Leiden (The Netherlands), and its research facility in Seville (Spain). The company has developed a proprietary SuperVero™ cell line and SVec™ gene delivery platform for the development of safe and efficient immunotherapies for major indications within the degenerative, inflammatory and autoimmune disease areas. In October 2019, Amarna secured €10 million in new equity to progress its SVec platform towards clinical studies. The financing round was led by Flerie Invest AB, a Swedish investment company, together with existing shareholders and an innovation credit from the \"Netherlands Enterprise Agency\" (RVO.nl).

    "text": "GENNEVILLIERS, France, Sept. 3, 2020 -- Exide Technologies (www.exide.com), a leading provider of stored electrical energy solutions, is expanding its product offer with the new GNB Marathon FTX range. The advanced AGM batteries are ideal for telecom and electric utility applications in good-grid environments, and offer exceptional reliability and performance at high temperatures. With its unique features, Marathon FTX is ideally suited to support 5G and progressive network densification. Marathon FTX has an extended service life at extreme operating temperatures (-40°C to 55°C), allowing businesses to reduce air conditioning costs. Its special diamond side-wall design maintains battery integrity in extreme temperatures, ensuring that all internal components remain tightly packed with no degradation in performance. Otherwise, plastic components soften when exposed to heat, which weakens the contact between the plates and separator. Marathon FTX has a long design life of 15 years under standard conditions, made possible by its optimised, high-corrosion resistance alloy. Even standard AGM batteries with their internal electrochemical recombination process lose a significant amount of water over time under high operating temperatures. MICROCAT® Catalyst reduces float current and minimises water loss by recombining the hydrogen and oxygen chemically back into water, further increasing the battery lifespan. This enables an exceptional service life of 5 years at 40°C. Thanks to Marathon FTX's excellent energy density less batteries are needed, which ensures efficient use of space. Its tolerance for high temperatures saves on air conditioning costs, while front-terminal access enables faster installation and maintenance. The result is a battery with exceptionally low total cost of ownership. It offers excellent float operation, and is ideally suited to the telecom and electric utility markets. \"Network densification is a major topic in the telecom industry, as network operators find ways to meet the ever-increasing demands of 5G. Managing both capital and operating expenditure is a major focus for network operators in this environment, and the Marathon FTX is specially designed to reduce cooling costs and minimise total cost of ownership,\" said Serge Arbes, Senior Business Director NP EMEA at Exide. Customers can choose between two options depending on their capacity requirements: M12V155FTX and M12V180FTX. The battery provides excellent performance across a range of environments, including hot locations with good grid access and installations with restricted cooling capabilities. marathon-ftx.png Marathon FTX http://www.exide.com"

    "url": "https://www.prnewswire.com//news-releases/global-shipments-of-tinyml-devices-to-reach-2-5-billion-by-2030--301123076.html",
    "text": "SINGAPORE, Sept. 3, 2020 -- According to global tech market advisory firm, ABI Research, a total of 2.5 billion devices are expected to be shipped with a Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) chipset in 2030, propelled by the increasing focus on low latency, advanced automation, and the availability of low-cost and ultra-power-efficient Artificial Intelligence (AI) chipsets. Also known as very edge AI or embedded AI, these chipsets perform AI inference almost fully on board, while they will continue to rely on external resources, such as gateways, on-premise servers, or the cloud for training. As enterprises start to look for AI solutions in areas of voice activation, image or video screening, people tracking, and ambient tracking, end-users struggled with the restricted nature of battery-powered sensors and embedded modules which operate on low computational resources offered by general-purpose microcontrollers. Often, edge sensors and devices need to handle large amounts of data. However, due to the low powered nature of these devices, they struggle to support high computing performance and high data throughput, causing latency issues. \"Since AI is deployed to make immediate critical decisions such as quality inspection, surveillance, and alarm management, any latency within the system may result in machine stoppage or slowdown causing heavy damages or loss in productivity. Moving AI to the edge mitigates potential vulnerability and risks such as unreliable connectivity and delayed responses,\" explains Lian Jye Su, Principal Analyst at ABI Research. Imbued with quantized AI models, TinyML chipsets enable smart sensors to perform data analytics on hardware and software dedicated for low powered systems, typically in the milliwatt range, using algorithms, networks, and models down to 100kB and below. Arm and CEVA have both launched a chipset IP solution that supports low powered AI inference with supporting software libraries, toolchains, and models. Low-powered AI chipset vendors include GreenWaves Technologies, Lattice Semiconductor, Rockchip, Syntiant, and XMOS have launched their embedded AI chipset products in 2019. Realizing the potential of TinyML in machine vision, CMOS vendors such as Sony and HiMax are also integrating TinyML chipset into their CMOS sensor. \"This means the market will soon start to see multiple AI chipsets in a single device at sensor and device level,\" Su says. More importantly, it is not just hardware development that accelerates the democratization of TinyML. Open-source software development from Google through TensorFlow Lite for Microcontroller and proprietary solutions from the likes of SensiML offer developer-friendly software tools and libraries, allowing more AI developers to create AI models that can support very edge applications. Developing competent and differentiated hardware is no longer enough. TinyML chipset manufacturers must focus on developing their AI developer ecosystem or be part of existing ecosystems, embrace open source, and focus on articulating their unique selling points and target markets to end-users. Without these conditions, chipset suppliers will struggle to generate scale for their products in what is expected to be a very competitive market. \"At the moment most of these solutions are still in the early stages of commercial deployment in smart cities and smart manufacturing, mainly used for asset tracking and anomaly sensing, and yet to achieve large-scale adoption. While able to offer better processing capabilities, sensors with TinyML are often much more expensive. End users will also need to design and introduce a new set of procedures and protocols to leverage the information and insights derived from these sensors,\" concludes Su. These findings are from ABI Research's Very Edge AI Chipset for TinyML Applications application analysis report. This report is part of the company's Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning research service, which includes research, data, and analyst insights. Based on extensive primary interviews, Application Analysis reports present in-depth analysis on key market trends and factors for a specific application, which could focus on an individual market or geography.

    "text": "Advertising companies love YUCHIP's new energy-saving LED screen. Lower-voltage input comes with common cathode encapsulation LED, making the LED advertising screen 'cold.' SHENZHEN, China, Sept. 3, 2020 --   YUCHIP launches a new design - a \"cold\" LED advertising screen that saves advertising companies up to 56% energy cost. Today, LED display application has realized vast growth. The LED advertising screen's applications are specifically defined as stage LED screen, transparent LED display, LED poster, etc. Along with the LED screen's cost drop, people have higher demands for large LED displays. A large screen delivers a more dynamic visual effect to passers-by. Due to that, the worldwide LED display panel is built bigger and bigger. In 2016, YUCHIP installed a 402sqm LED advertising screen in Lima, Peru, the largest LED display in South America. Even though LED display is environment-friendly technology and energy-saving, power consumption is still high, especially LED advertising displays which are always big, with electricity cost at 4/5 of operating cost. As China's leading LED display manufacturer, YUCHIP engineers keep researching energy-saving LED screens and know energy savings are realized by a lower-voltage power input. So, instead of the standard 5V DC power input, Red lamp bead power input is DC 2.8V and Green and Blue lamp bead power input is DC3.8V, and the PCB, IC and power supply all have energy-saving models. YUCHIP engineers explained: The R, G, B (red, green, blue) of the LED lamp bead is used to supply power separately, and the current and voltage are accurately distributed to the R, G, B lamp bead. Each lamp bead requires a different working voltage and current, the current passes through the lamp beads and then to the negative electrode of the IC, and when the forward voltage drop is reduced, the internal resistance of conduction will be reduced. YUCHIP engineers introduced four advantages of the newly designed LED advertising display. Found in 2004, YUCHIP is an award-winning global LED display supplier headquartered in China. As a comprehensive LED display manufacturer, the company focuses on offering top-notch technology and high-performing visual products. The engineers use this energy-saving technology in stage LED screens,transparent LED displays, LED posters, flexible LED displays and more. https://www.yuchip-led.com/ A3 Building, Fu Wei 2nd Industrial Park, Fu Yong Town, Bo an District, Shenzhen, China.

    "text": "SINGAPORE, Sept. 3, 2020 -- 45 producers and 56 lots of specialty grade coffee from 12 countries will be joining the first Singapore (Micro-Lot) Specialty Coffee Auction organised virtually by the Singapore Coffee Association (SCA), in partnership with Food&HotelAsia (FHA), on 1 October 2020. All producers are first timers from Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Indonesia, Kenya, Myanmar, Panama, Peru, Timor Leste, Venezuela and Zambia. For many specialty coffee producers, selling their beans through traders have been the legacy practice. However, the pandemic, which caused travel and social restrictions to be enforced worldwide, has disrupted supply chains and turned coffee trading sluggish. Staging a virtual coffee auction helps to mitigate trade and supply challenges by allowing buyers to source directly from the origin, and also enable coffee producers to establish a presence in the Asian market. The Singapore (Micro-Lot) Specialty Coffee Auction will present 56 lots of specialty grade coffee beans including the rare and premium Panamanian Geisha from Panamanian producers -- Café Don Benjie and Cafelino S.A. The world's most expensive coffee beans, the Geisha beans were sold at US$1,029 for a pound in 2019. Grown in the highland areas of Panama, the Geisha beans undergo a meticulous process, from hand-picking of the ripe cherries to processing the beans. Check out the auction catalogue and full listing of varieties here. \"I am very pleased to be participating in this first ever virtual coffee auction organised by the Singapore Coffee Association. I am sure that the auction will be an event of great success because of its extraordinary organisation. It is an honour to be able to present our best Panama Geisha Coffee to the Asia Pacific market,\" commented Stefan Muller, Managing Director, Cafe Don Benjie, producer of Panamanian Geisha. \"It is interesting and really innovative for the Singapore Coffee Association to be organising a coffee auction virtually. The event is a timely one which I trust will effectively help farmers like us to market our green coffee to Asia,\" said Xenia de Ameglio, Owner, Cafelino S.A, producer of Panamanian Geisha. \"Since the launch of our Singapore (Micro Lot) Specialty Coffee (Virtual) Auction in late July, we have received tremendous amount of interest from all around the world. With an anticipated 40 auction lots, we have now 56 lots of high quality specialty coffee from 12 countries participating in this event. An estimated 200 bidders from around Asia and the Middle East are expected to turn up at this first ever virtual coffee auction. We will be looking forward to an exciting programme on 1 October,\" said Mr Victor Mah, President, Singapore Coffee Association. To complement the auction, an exclusive webinar organised by the ASEAN Coffee Federation (ACF), \"Effects of Climate Change on Coffee Production in ASEAN\" will be held before the auction on the same day.

    "text": "BEIJING, Sept. 3, 2020 -- Tibet is dubbed the \"the Roof of the World\" for good reason. It's not just for its high altitude, but also the foothills of snow-capped mountains with crystal-clear rivers flowing along in harmony. CGTN's \"Into Tibet 2020\" presents three teams led by CGTN reporters and accompanied by international journalists and vloggers. Starting September 18, they have taken different routes across the plateau from Tibet's capital city Lhasa, where they joined traditional celebrations to show audience the real Tibet. In Tibet, they learned how to draw Thangka painting with local artists, met \"Living Buddha\" Kyungpo in Tashi Lhunpo Monastery, spent a day with Tibetan internet celebrity Lhamo, fed the Tibetan bulls, learned to ride a horse and explored the region through different routes. CGTN reporter Li Jingjing, Canadian Youtuber Daniel Dumbrill and French journalist Manuel Rambaud are three members from Team DJ. Li Jingjing and her team met \"Living Buddha\" Kyungpo in Tashi Lhunpo Monastery, reached the base camp for Mount Qomolangma, and visited Rongpo Monastery, the highest monastery in the world. Beard Brothers team consists mainly of CGTN's reporter Marco Shan, journalist Oscar Margain and a Bahraini \"China Expert\" PhD Yaser Ali Taher Jawad. On August 29, they talked to Tibetan internet celebrity Lhamo, who has nearly 1.5 million followers. She lives a quiet life in Qonggyai County but built up a huge following just by sharing her everyday routine. The team spent a day with Lhamo and tried to find out the secret to her online success. Their route covers Tibetan folk dance, local musical band, thousand-year-old crafts, a lake \"in the sky,\" yaks on a plateau and more. The third team named themselves A.N.T., which has CGTN reporter Yang Xinmeng, Spanish vlogger Noel and digital guru of CGTN Russian Sergei. Yang and Noel learned how to draw Tibetan Thangka paintings with local artists on August 21, the sacred art of such religious painting has been passed down the generations. They met Sithar Dorje, who is one of the representative inheritors who has contributed to passing down the legacy. \"The Epic of King Gesar\" he performs is one of the world's oldest epic poems. During the trip of CGTN's three teams, a vivid and colorful Tibet is presented to the audiences. The veil of the mysterious \"Roof of the World\" was lifted. For people who live in this ancient land, we are separated not only by distance but geography as well. However it's our emotions that bind us together.

    "text": "LOS ANGELES, Sept. 3, 2020 -- Despite the ongoing pandemic, three in four retirees (75 percent) say their confidence in their ability to maintain a comfortable lifestyle through retirement has stayed the same, according to a study released today by nonprofit Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies® (TCRS). While this stability in retirement confidence seems to be good news, it should also be underscored that only 29 percent are \"very confident\" in their ability to do so. Retirees and Retirement Amid COVID-19 is based on findings from TCRS' 20th Annual Retirement Survey, which comprises a supplemental survey conducted in June 2020 and a broader survey in late 2019. The research examines retirees' finances before and during the pandemic, and their preparations during their working years. \"Retirees, in some ways, may be more resilient in this economic downturn than employed workers. Most have guaranteed income in the form of Social Security and access to health insurance coverage through Medicare. Unlike employed workers, most retirees do not have a job to lose,\" said Catherine Collinson, CEO and president of Transamerica Institute® and TCRS. \"Nevertheless, they are still susceptible to both the health and economic effects of the pandemic.\" The June 2020 survey yields these insights: \"Retirees can and should be taking more steps to safeguard their health and financial well-being. However, they may find it difficult while sheltering in place. Now more than ever before, they may need extra encouragement and support from their families and friends,\" said Collinson. \"Many retirees were forced into retirement before they were ready, which shortened their working years, extended their time in retirement, and left them more financially vulnerable,\" said Collinson. \"Retirees have been getting by, but they risk outliving their savings.\" The late 2019 survey findings illustrate their situation: \"Before the pandemic, retirees were living with limited income and savings. Now, amid the pandemic, a pressing question is whether and how they would be able to contend with a major financial setback such as long-term care expenses,\" said Collinson. \"This economic downturn highlights the many ways in which retirees are financially vulnerable, but it also reveals action steps that future generations can be taking to help mitigate risks and improve their outcomes,\" said Collinson. In the late 2019 survey, retirees shared these insights: \"The pandemic is exacerbating weaknesses in the U.S. retirement system and government safety nets.  Policymakers, industry, employers, academics, nonprofits, communities, individuals, and families must join together to create innovative solutions, so that all individuals have the ability to retire with dignity. The sooner we take action, the sooner we can achieve results,\" said Collinson.

About the 20th Annual Transamerica Retirement Survey and June 2020 Supplemental SurveyThe analysis contained in Retirees and Retirement Amid COVID-19 was prepared internally by the research team at TCRS based on results from the 20th Annual Transamerica Retirement Survey and a supplement survey conducted in June 2020. The 20th Annual Transamerica Retirement Survey of Retirees was conducted online within the U.S. by The Harris Poll on behalf of TCRS from November 13 to December 4, 2019 among a nationally representative sample of 2,040 self-identified retirees, including 1,841 fully retired and 199 semi-retired. Respondents met the following criteria: U.S. residents, age 50+, worked in a for-profit company employing one or more people for the majority of their career. Census data were referenced for education, age by gender, race/ethnicity, region, and household income. Results were weighted where necessary to bring them into line with the population of U.S. residents age 50+ who are retired or semi-retired. The weighting also adjusts for attitudinal and behavioral differences between those who are online versus those who are not, those who join online panels versus those who do not, and those who respond to surveys versus those who do not. No estimates of theoretical sampling error can be calculated. The June 2020 Supplemental Survey was conducted online within the U.S. by The Harris Poll on behalf of TCRS from June 18 to 22, 2020 among a nationally representative sample of 2,001 U.S. adults. The data in this report is shown for a subsample of 411 adults who self-identified as being retired and age 50+.

    "text": "BLACKSBURG, Va. and STUTTGART, Germany and PORTLAND, Ore., Sept. 3, 2020 -- September 2020 marks one year of Daimler Trucks and Torc Robotics partnering as a team after the U.S. based automated driving technology company became part of Daimler Trucks' Autonomous Technology Group. One year together, collaboratively pursuing a common goal of bringing series-produced highly automated trucks (SAE Level 4) to the roads within the decade; including on-road deployment of a Level 4 test fleet, initiation of redesign of truck chassis, adoption of a hub-to-hub model, formalized rigorous testing protocols, formal truck safety driver certification process, and extended software capabilities. Now, the Autonomous Technology Group will extend its testing to New Mexico by building up a new testing center in Albuquerque. Expanding to a new location will support testing and provide data for more use cases of next generation vehicles on public roads starting this fall. Daimler Trucks and Torc started their collaboration in spring 2019. Initial public road testing on highways began in September in southwest Virginia, where Torc is headquartered. Additionally, closed-track road testing is conducted in Madras, OR, at Daimler Trucks North America's High Desert Proving Grounds. In February 2020, Daimler Trucks and Torc announced plans to expand testing of automated truck technology to additional locations, adding new public routes in the U.S., but the activation was postponed due to COVID-19 pandemic. During the pandemic downtime, the teams continued testing by focusing on robust simulation testing. Public road testing with safety and health protocols in place resumed in Virginia in June 2020 and will be continued with the next generation of automated driving software. The team in Oregon, will continue focusing on the development of vehicle safety systems, which are critical for delivering the safety standards for self-driving trucks today and in the future. The goal is to refine a truck chassis that is perfectly suited for highly automated driving and includes the redundancy of systems needed to achieve safe, reliable driving. Martin Daum, Chairman of the Board of Management of Daimler Truck AG and Member of the Board of Management of Daimler AG, \"After one year of collaboration with Torc, we have successfully deployed trucks with SAE Level 4 intent technology on public roads and expanded our test fleet with trucks, miles and learnings.  Partnering with Torc has created a unique and even more powerful team of innovators at Daimler Trucks.  We remain fully committed to this collaboration and to focusing on the shared goal of bringing highly automated trucks to series production.\" Roger Nielsen, Daimler Trucks Board Member, President and CEO of Daimler Trucks North America, \"We know this will not happen overnight, but with our priority and vision for safer roads and efficiencies for our customers, we are committed to the journey. We listen carefully to our customers and we see potential to deliver commercial value to them and to society.\" Dr. Peter Vaughan Schmidt, Head of Autonomous Technology Group at Daimler Trucks, \"The partnership has enabled both our teams to move faster on developing Level 4 trucks, providing Daimler engineers with insights on how the technology will impact truck design, and providing Torc with data and perspective on what technology will work best for the trucking industry. We will implement the results of our collaboration in the next phase of public road testing later this year.\" \"We have accomplished a lot during the first year,\" said Michael Fleming, CEO of Torc Robotics. \"In addition to testing our technology stack on trucks on the highway in Virginia, we have scaled up our team and grown quickly - recently opening our expanded headquarters in Virginia to accommodate this growth. Daimler's commitment to safety, innovation leadership of truck technology and foundational knowledge of on-road scenarios that truckers encounter has moved our system faster than we could have done alone as a technology firm. By working with the inventor of the truck and number one truck OEM, we are convinced that Level 4 trucks can be commercialized safely with a strong business case.\" Daimler Trucks has dozens of years of experience in testing and validating the durability, reliability and safety of commercial vehicles around the world. In 2019, Daimler Trucks North America, the North America market share leader, unveiled the first SAE Level 2 automated truck, the Freightliner Cascadia. With Active Drive Assist (Mercedes-Benz Actros, FUSO Super Great) and Detroit Assurance 5.0 with Active Lane Assist (Freightliner Cascadia), Daimler Trucks has delivered automated driving features into series production. Similarly, Torc has 15 years of experience in commercializing self-driving technology in heavy-duty, safety-critical applications. Moreover, Torc's \"Asimov\" autonomous driving system has been tested on public roads including a cross-country journey. As a result of combining their extensive technology and testing experience, Daimler Trucks and Torc have developed a comprehensive validation approach and safety protocols for automated driving; aligned with the federal framework policy for testing and commercial deployment of SAE Level 4 automated trucks. All automated test drives require the combination of a safety conductor, overseeing the system, and a highly trained safety driver, certified by Daimler Trucks and Torc. All safety drivers hold commercial driver's licenses and are specially trained in vehicle dynamics and automated systems. Daimler Trucks in market leading position as demand grows – best testing conditions in the U.S. According to the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics, the U.S. has seen the tonnage of goods shipped by trucks increase by 56 percent in the past decade. This number is expected to nearly double in the next two and a half decades. These developments contribute to a growing need for safe, reliable, cost-effective trucking solutions. Daimler Trucks North America's role, as the U.S. market leader, and as the innovation leader for the industry, provides a unique position to safely develop and test automated truck technologies. Following the investment announcement in automated driving at the beginning of last year, Daimler Trucks established the Autonomous Technology Group in June 2019. Together with Torc and Daimler Trucks North America, Daimler Trucks' global organization for automated truck driving brings together its worldwide experience and expertise. The group takes responsibility for the overall strategy and implementation of the automated driving strategic roadmap, including research and development, testing and validation and setting up the required operations infrastructure and network. The Autonomous Technology Group has a global reach with experts working in various locations throughout the company's worldwide development network located in Portland, Madras and Blacksburg in the U.S. and in Stuttgart, Germany. Based in Blacksburg, Virginia, Torc became part of the Autonomous Technology Group in August 2019, following Daimler Trucks' investment in the company. The combination of the two companies' strengths creates a unique partnership – blending Torc's expertise in self-driving software development and vehicle integration with Daimler Trucks' experience in delivering reliable and safe trucks. By offering advanced, road-ready technology, plus years of experience in heavy vehicles, Torc has grown into a global industry leader in the field of automated driving. Torc's SAE Level 4 virtual driver system \"Asimov\" has been integrated and tested successfully in multiples platforms running on public roads from urban to long-distance highway routes as well as in rain, snow, fog and varying light conditions. As part of this research and development, Portland-based Daimler Trucks North America (DTNA) is refining a truck chassis that is perfectly suited for highly automated driving as well as the redundancy of systems needed to achieve safe, reliable driving. As part of the Autonomous Technology Group, DTNA is also researching the infrastructure required for the operational testing of initial application cases. DTNA is contributing to the successful development of automated driving technology and vehicle integration for heavy-duty trucks. Daimler Trucks is the pioneer of truck automation. In 2014, the world's leading truck manufacturer presented the Mercedes-Benz Future Truck 2025, the world's first automated truck, and was the first to demonstrate the technological opportunities and great potential that automated trucks offer customers and society. In 2015, Daimler's Freightliner Inspiration Truck obtained the first-ever road license for a partially automated commercial vehicle demonstrating the promise of automated driving on the highways of Nevada. Today, Daimler offers partially automated driving features (SAE Level 2) with the Mercedes-Benz Actros, the Freightliner Cascadia and the FUSO Super Great. www.daimler.com"

    "title": "Admitad launches the Marketplace",

    "text": "HEILBRONN, Germany, Sept. 3, 2020 -- Admitad announced the launch of Admitad Affiliate Marketplace — an aggregator of affiliate programs from multiple networks. The platform provides advertisers of the connected CPA networks with access to the traffic of Admitad publishers worldwide, taking care of the publisher engagement and accounting. When developing the platform, the Admitad team drew on experience of AdGoal company acquired in 2019, or rather its subnetwork business model. More than 35,000 advertisers are currently connected to the Marketplace through 60 partner networks. Their total turnover through the marketplace amounted to €1.3 bn in just under three quarters of 2020. There used to be three main problems in subnetworks: advertisers could not see exact traffic sources, could not choose publishers and types of advertising, and sometimes shut down the whole affiliate program due to violations of just one publisher. You had to contact subnetworks personally to deal with such issues, which increased the amount of administrative work. For advertisers, it was difficult to work with subnetworks. In the new Admitad Marketplace, they have solved these problems and improved the quality of service: advertisers from integrated affiliate networks will now be able to moderate partners independently as well as choose traffic sources and disable specific publishers for violations. \"Highly transparent operations, advanced tools, user-friendly interface are the features implemented in the new Admitad Affiliate Marketplace,\" — Admitad Founder & CEO Alexander Bachmann comments on the platform launch. Affiliate Marketplace is a product that lets all marketers build long-term mutually beneficial relationships. It is a new level of trust. Firstly, it is important for Admitad to be a high-quality service provider for affiliate networks, facilitating expansion of their presence and significantly increasing the number of active publishers. It includes instant access to dozens of thousands of vloggers, social media and messenger channel owners, loyalty programs and cashback services, discount sites and exclusive technology partners. Secondly, the marketplace will become a single entry point for publishers to make money on the Internet. There are more than a thousand affiliate networks in the world, and it is simply impractical to create an account for each one. Instead, Admitad offers publishers one personal account, a single API for accessing all the tools, and a single service for receiving payments. If you are interested in using the Admitad Affiliate Marketplace services, feel free to leave a request. Founded by Alexander Bachmann in 2010 as a stand-alone cost-per-action network, in just 10 years Admitad became a multi-vector ecosystem – a service provider for advertisers, publishers and other affiliate networks. In 2019, it had 1500 advertisers, including Booking, Asos, AliExpress, Lenovo, etc. and delivered a total of $5bn in advertisers' revenue. Admitad is a subsidiary of AB Capital Group, along with a cluster of IT start-ups, a venture investment fund and interest in multiple affiliate marketing businesses. The company is headquartered in Heilbronn, Germany. Its primary markets are the US, UK, Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Poland, Brazil, India and CIS countries.

    "text": "SEOUL, South Korea, Sept. 3, 2020 -- The Anti-Pollution Research Center of Amorepacific R&D Center has developed the world's first clinical evaluation method for blocking blue light from reaching the skin. The research paper, which involves research on the harmful effects of blue light on the skin, the development of clinical devices, verification of the efficacy of blocking agents and so on, has been published in the August 18, 2020 issue (the 19th issue of 2020) of The Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology, which is the SCI-grade international academic journal. (Paper name: Clinical evaluation method for blue light (456 nm) protection of skin) Blue light is a blue wavelength portion of the visible light spectrum ranging from 380−500 nm (nanometers). Blue light has the shortest wavelength and the strongest energy among all types of visible light, and prolonged exposure to this type of light is known to have harmful effects, such as sleep disturbance and damage to vision. Blue light can have detrimental effects on the skin as well, including skin pigmentation and reductions in skin elasticity and moisture. Prior to Amorepacific's research, however, there had not been any clinical research that had concretely proved the harmfulness of everyday blue light exposure to the skin. Cho Hong-ri, a senior researcher of the Anti-Pollution Research Center in Amorepacific R&D Center, has developed a device that can detect blue light wavelengths that are harmful to the skin and can clinically evaluate blue light blocking performance at those wavelengths. The new device developed by Amorepacific produces blue light wavelengths that modern people are often exposed to due to artificial lighting emitted by smartphones, TVs, etc. In addition, by finely adjusting the intensity and time of light, the device also makes it easier to conduct clinical evaluations on skin damage that people can experience in their daily lives due to exposure to the blue light. Through an experiment using the clinical device, Amorepacific R&D Center revealed the fact that blue light with a wavelength of 456 nm causes skin pigmentation. Based on the finding, Amorepacific tested whether a blue light blocker developed and released by the company itself can actually prevent skin pigmentation with the company subsequently proving the blue light blocking effects of the blocker on the basis of the measurement of changes in melanin index values, etc. Amorepacific R&D Center has been researching the harmfulness of blue light on the skin since 2017. In particular, the results of the company's research on its own clinical evaluation method for blue light blocking performance, the first of its kind in the world, were presented at IFSCC (International Federation of Societies of Cosmetic Chemists) conference held in Munich, Germany in 2018. Moving forward, Amorepacific plans to conduct further research on the environmental effects and the resulting changes in skin and continue developing products to protect the skin health of customers around the world. Since 1945, Amorepacific has had a single, clear mission: to present its unique perception of beauty– namely what it calls 'Asian Beauty' – to the world. As Korea's leading beauty company, Amorepacific draws from its deep understanding of both nature and human to pursue harmony between inner and outer beauty.

Kolstad et al. - ref. below). The publication confirms the potential of Betalutin®, a single-dose radioimmunotherapy, to treat elderly, heavily pre-treated patients with relapsed/refractory indolent B-cell NHL. There is a high unmet need for new treatment options, particularly in elderly patients with R/R follicular lymphoma (FL) and small molecule targeted therapies have so far not provided safe and effective alternatives, when chemotherapy is no longer an option. Radioimmunotherapy is an under-used option, and Betalutin® may represent an attractive alternative for the treatment of relapsed/refractory FL. Dr Arne Kolstad, Radiumhospitalet, Oslo University Hospital, commented: \"The publication provides clinical data supporting the potential of Betalutin® to provide an attractive single-dose treatment for relapsed/refractory FL.

We combine the benefits of instalment and card products to offer the best way for our customers to pay overtime, anywhere. We believe that this generation should be able to responsibly have what they want when they want without being financially penalised for the privilege.\" Zilch delivers its unique proposition to customers by leveraging its strategic partnership with Mastercard. Jason Lane, EVP, Market Development Europe at Mastercard commented: \"Zilch is a flourishing fintech which aims to help shoppers manage their cashflows in a way that fits their timeline. At Mastercard, we continue to be the partner of choice for fintech across Europe as we strive to help scale innovative payment solutions that improve people's lives.\" Zilch customers already enjoy the ability to pay over time anywhere they like online at big brands such as Amazon, eBay, Ali Express, Nike, and more but will soon be able to \"tap and pay overtime\" in-store too. The London based fintech will make use of the proceeds from the funding round to accelerating the rollout of their product offering. Commenting on the partnership, Joanne Dewar, Chief Executive Officer of Global Processing Services, said, \"We have been working closely with Zilch to support their unique processing model, and are excited about their promising growth in the space.

    "text": "LONDON, Sept. 3, 2020 -- Technology start-up inploi has launched a string of new features adding tens of thousands of job opportunities to their platform and positioning it squarely as the professional community to connect the New Collar Workforce with companies that want to engage and hire from this demographic. inploi notes that 82% of their user base do not have a LinkedIn profile. With most hiring activity paused during the COVID lockdown, the inploi team have seized the opportunity to test and launch new tools including in-platform voice and video calling, job seeker profile videos, expanded company pages for enhanced employer brand development and a number of integrations that ready the platform for international expansion, already underway. Co-founder and CTO Alex Hanson-Smith commented: \"our mission is to  build a job discovery platform for the future of the workforce, providing them with the best user experience when searching for opportunities, networking, or seeking career-related resources; and to deliver an end-to-end hiring solution for companies seeking to engage the next generation of talent. Our latest updates represent the next stage of this mission and allow us to serve a much wider audience, with companies and job seekers in multiple industries and geographies utilising our platform.\" Available across web and mobile, inploi is designed to help companies engage the workforce of tomorrow: building communities around their brands and job opportunities. The New Collar Workforce - a category coined by inploi - comprises Millennial and Gen-Z job seekers: already the majority of the workforce and necessarily the future of every organisation. This demographic is poorly understood and poorly engaged when it comes to recruitment marketing. inploi has today published a white paper - The New Collar Worker: how to reach, engage and recruit the future of your workforce - drawing on their own proprietary research and work done by Deloitte, Gallup Polling, and the Pew Research Centre that considers this topic. inploi CEO and co-founder Matthew de la Hey notes: \"the New Collar workforce are tech savvy, mission-driven, and mobile. They care about who they work with and what type of place they're working for more than any generation before them. They are consumers of workplaces and need to be convinced about the culture and values of an organisation, in addition to the type of work they're doing. But that is not enough - this needs to be delivered using technology they are familiar with and a seamless user experience that digital natives expect.  Communicating with the New Collar workforce effectively calls for a new approach: new technologies, new messaging, and new organisational behaviours. That is why inploi exists.\" Starting in the hospitality sector, inploi has already been used by more than 100,000 candidates to build a professional profile and to find work with major employers including Park Plaza Hotels and Young's Pubs. By adding new industries and leveraging partner integrations, inploi has expanded its job content to over 150,000 searchable vacancies right across the United Kingdom, Germany and New Zealand. Hanson-Smith continued \"as we enter a difficult economic period with unemployment set to rise, our mission is more important than ever before: helping people to find decent jobs with great employers, in any industry, within a forum of advice and support.\" inploi is a recruitment marketing platform built to connect great employers with the future of the workforce. With employer branding at its heart, inploi empowers companies to speak to candidates as consumers of workplaces, helping them to tell their stories with captivating videos, images, and written content in order to engage active and passive candidates. When actively hiring, inploi's software is a powerful recruitment tool incorporating job post creation and distribution, applicant tracking, CV-parsing, candidate-job matching, proactive talent search, video profiles, instant messaging, video calling, file sharing, programmatic job advertising and more. Delivering a best-in-class user experience, inploi is accessible via the web and iOS or Android mobile applications, meaning companies and candidates can easily connect and communicate, however they access the internet. Founded by Matthew de la Hey and Alexander Hanson-Smith in 2016, inploi has presented at Stanford University as part of the US State Department's Global Economic Summit, in Beijing at Peking University's Global Youth Entrepreneurship Summit, and has won awards including Springboard's Best Use of Social Media to Attract Talent and the Best Newcomer at the Global Recruiter awards, and was recognised as one of the UK's Top 100 start-ups in 2019, and as one of the Top 50 most influential brands in the  sector by  Brand Weekly. inploi has previously partnered with Deliveroo to provide employer branding and job advertising services to its restaurant partners and with Jobs on Facebook to further expand the audience for its employer partners' jobs. inploi seeks to work with both large and independent businesses across the service economy – opening the door to a wide range of employers and candidates providing them best-in-class technology – a significant departure from the traditional 'jobs board' model. https://inploi.com"

    "text": "IRVINE, Calif., Sept. 3, 2020 -- ATTOM Data Solutions, curator of the nation's premier property database and first property data provider of Data-as-a-Service (DaaS), teamed up with CityBldr, a Seattle-based proptech company that uses AI to determine the best use of land, to discover that a widespread group of mostly-impoverished, densely-packed urban neighborhoods ranging from Anacostia in southeast Washington, DC, to the South Shore area of Chicago, IL, to City Heights in central San Diego, CA, offer some of the most attractive opportunities in the nation for housing developers to take advantage of federal reinvestment tax benefits. CityBldr data spotlights 11 neighborhoods in seven states and the District of Columbia with some of the best potential for using Opportunity Zone tax benefits designed to spur revival in low-income communities across the United States. The zones were established by Congress under the 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act. Along with Anacostia, South Shore, and City Heights, other neighborhoods identified include Mid-City in central Los Angeles; Parramore in west-central Orlando, FL; Central District in eastern Seattle, WA; West Colfax in western Denver, CO; Spartan Keyes in eastern San Jose, CA; North End/New Center in northern Detroit, MI; Buckman/Kerns in southeastern Portland, OR; and Hilltop in central Tacoma, WA. Most of those areas stand out as notably poorer and more densely populated than the U.S. as a whole, with lower income and educational levels and far higher percentages of renters than homeowners. However, contributing to their economic potential, a few have above-average educational levels, and most have home values that far exceed the national median home price. They also have seen a wide range of median home price increases and decreases over the past year, from nearly doubling in Chicago's South Shore neighborhood, to a drop of 12 percent in the Mid-City section of Los Angeles, according to ATTOM. The areas were identified by CityBldr as among those where both communities and housing developers have the most to gain from Opportunity Zone tax benefits, based on machine learning technology from various data sources and a detailed understanding of the various markets. \"This data tells us that housing developers should consider investing in these neighborhoods because they have an immense amount of potential, plus tax benefits aimed at realizing that potential,\" said Bryan Copley, co-founder and CEO of CityBldr. \"What we've done with this study is create a standardized score to compare every opportunity zone in the U.S. to determine which areas would yield the highest average return on investment.\" Todd Teta, chief product officer with ATTOM Data Solutions, noted that ATTOM contributed another key element showing home price changes from the first half of 2019 to the first half of 2020 in those areas. \"Factoring in home values and how they've done in the past year adds a critical piece of data to the picture,\" said Teta. \"Developers can get a demographic snapshot of what these areas look like, plus the hard numbers on how home prices are changing.\" Report methodologyThe overview of these opportunity zones looked at high redevelopment values defined by CityBldr in an analysis designed to showcase area that offer the greatest value to be gained by investors for building multifamily apartments, rowhomes or townhomes in those areas. Those census tracts included in the analysis also must have sufficient home sales prices from ATTOM Data Solutions, to show a year-over-year and two-year median home sales price change.

    "url": "https://www.prnewswire.com//news-releases/what-is-whartons-jelly-301123464.html",
    "text": "With the ability to extract useful stem cell lines from perinatal materials that are routinely disposed of as medical waste following births, a host of issues are minimized and potential medical development expanded. Wharton's jelly has quickly become recognized as a powerful substance that is easy to access and in which a multitude of uses can be found. CLEARWATER, Fla., Sept. 2, 2020 -- Wharton's jelly is at the forefront of current medical research. Its name dates back to the 17th century when the English anatomist Thomas Wharton first identified the jellylike substance that surrounds vital parts inside the umbilical cord. Today, it has become a distinct source of stem cells and, therefore, Advanced Medical Integration considers it a critical element in the advancement of medical treatments for everything from wound care to surgical procedures. Found within Wharton's jelly are several distinct stem cell genes. With this raw material, biomedical firms can create stem cell lines that, among other things, aid recuperation via the regeneration of tissue that has been lost or damaged. This is because stem cells are, basically, the core building blocks of all human cells. When retrieved from sources like Wharton's jelly, stem cells are not dedicated to any specific bodily function. But their power is that they have the ability, when introduced to other parts of the body, to adapt and grow into other, more \"mature\" types of cells (known as potency). Stem cells are unspecialized cells of the human body. They are able to differentiate into any cell of an organism and have the ability of self-renewal. Stem cells exist both in embryos and adult cells. There are several steps of specialization. Current research is focused on growing a wide range of new tissue from stem cells, including muscle, blood, brain, and cartilage cells. It is an intricate field with remarkable potential. There are currently four ways of sourcing stem cells. Each is now a distinct area of study and research, with the relative strengths and weaknesses of each methodology being probed and perfected: image1.png"

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/investments-in-e-commerce-helped-lego-build-success-through-the-coronavirus-pandemic-51599068518?mod=home-page",
    "text": "Lego, the world’s biggest toy company, shrugged off coronavirus related store closures to sell more of its distinctive bricks online boosting half year sales and operating profit. The privately owned Danish firm is a pandemic winner as families, stuck at home due the lockdown, played more games and bought more of its products. Lego Group reported that operating profit was up a strong 11% to 3.9 billion Danish Krone ($621 million), with the company gaining more market share globally and succeeding off the back of investments into e-commerce. The back story. Since being founded in 1932, Lego, which is still based in the small Danish town of Billund, has grown to be one of the most recognized toy brands in the world. Privately held, Lego’s brand is based on its distinctive small building blocks, which take center stage in its toys as well as movies and videogame franchises. What’s new. Its profitable, direct-to-consumer business saw sales surge 14% over last year as the company sold directly to families stuck at home. Visitors to its e-commerce platform doubled to more than 100 million compared with last year. These sales drove the strong operating profit even as it was dragged down by costs associated with shipping products following factory closures in China and Mexico. Lego also said its “Let’s Build Together” initiative, which brings learning through play to children stuck at home, had reached over 80 million unique users. Also: This 7-Year-Old Has Loved Finances Since Age 3. Here’s How His Parents Taught Him About Money. Looking ahead. Lego plans to open 120 new retail stores in 2020, 80 of which will be in China at a time when others are scaling back. It has built growth through these testing times by having foresight to invest in e-commerce and confidence to innovate during the pandemic. It used the first half of 2020 to launch products that mix digital and physical play and is well set to remain resilient so it will be in a good position when stores fully reopen around the world.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-government-is-making-a-big-change-in-how-it-reports-jobless-claims-heres-why-2020-09-02?mod=home-page",
    "text": "Investors beware: The number of people applying for unemployment benefits could fall sharply when the government reports  jobless claims on Thursday, but it won’t necessarily mean far fewer people are losing their jobs. The Bureau of Labor Statistics said last week it will change its method for adjusting initial jobless claims to account for seasonal swings in employment. That’s a big deal. As a result, new claims could show a large decline of potentially 200,000 or more in the week ended Aug. 29. The BLS will report the numbers at 8:30 a.m. Eastern. The agency’s traditional season-adjustment process worked fine when the U.S. experienced regular ups and downs in employment around the holidays or the end of the school year. Tens of thousands of people, for example, are hired before Christmas and left go after the New Year. The claims numbers are adjusted to smooth out these normal swings in employment. Yet the old approach to seasonal adjustments has been thrown out of whack by a once-in-a-century pandemic. The seasonally adjusted numbers have constantly exceeded the actual number of people applying for benefits, with the gap becoming especially large in the past month. Consider the most recent week. The government said new jobless claims in the week ended Aug. 22 rose by 1 million after seasonal adjustments. Yet actual or unadjusted claims increased by a smaller 821,591. That’s an 18% difference. The new method of adjustment, based on an additive instead of a multiplicative approach, is complicated to explain. Suffice to say it should result in a much narrower gap between the actual and  seasonally adjusted number of new jobless claims. If so, new claims in the most recent week could fall to 800,000 or below. (If the number actually rises, it would be a bad sign). If it’s not confusing enough, the government won’t revise prior figures for jobless claims under the old method of seasonal adjustments. Not that it matters all that much. Jobless claims soared to record peaks after the coronavirus struck and they are still extremely high by historical standards, even as they continue to decline. New claims ran in the low 200,000s each week and sat near a 50-year low before the crisis.

    "text": "More than 100 economists, including at least seven Nobel winners, have signed an open letter urging the Senate to reject Federal Reserve nominee Judy Shelton, calling her views “extreme and ill-considered.” Shelton was nominated for the Fed’s seven-member board of governors by President Donald Trump earlier this year, and the Senate Banking Committee gave her the green light on a party-line vote in July. The full Senate is expected to take up her nomination soon. Shelton was an adviser to Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and has criticized the Fed over its interest-rate policy and influence over the U.S. economy. Critics claim she’s too partisan and would endanger the Fed’s independence. In their letter, the economists said the Fed needs to preserve its “nonpartisan approach,” and questioned Shelton’s qualifications. “Ms. Shelton has a decades-long record of writings and statements that call into question her fitness for a spot on the Fed’s board of governors,” they wrote. “She has advocated for a return to the gold standard; she has questioned the need for federal deposit insurance; she has even questioned the need for a central bank at all. Now, she appears to have jettisoned all of these positions to argue for subordination of the Fed’s policies to the White House — at least as long as the White House is occupied by a president who agrees with her political views.” In her nomination hearing in February, Shelton backed away from some of her previous writings, but Democrats charged she has not changed her views and would have worsened the economic impact of the pandemic if she had been sitting on the Fed board at the time. The letter’s signatories include seven winners of the Nobel Prize for economics: Robert E. Lucas and Lars Peter Hansen of the University of Chicago, Christopher Sims from Princeton University, Eric Maskin and Oliver Hart of Harvard University, Peter Diamond of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Joseph Stiglitz of Columbia University. A separate, nearly word-for-word letter was signed by 70 former Federal Reserve officials and staffers, urging senators to reject Shelton’s nomination. Copyright © 2020 MarketWatch, Inc.

    "text": "The chief executive of one of the world’s biggest advertising groups has been forced to apologize after misspeaking during a financial update and sparking a row over ageism. He was asked if the business, home to leading agencies including Ogilvy, Wunderman Thompson, Finsbury, Kantar Group and Grey, had the correct balance of people with skills in digital compared with more traditional television. He had replied: “We have a very broad range of skills, and if you look at our people — the average age of someone who works at WPP is less than 30. They don’t hark back to the 1980s, luckily.” This has triggered an industry row over how experience is valued across businesses, with former employees and commentators questioning whether there is a place for creatives and account managers over the age of 30. Gabriel Dorosz, executive strategy director at The New York Times, tweeted: “I assure you, no one who has worked at WPP, and there are many of us, are shocked or even remotely surprised by Mark Read’s comments.” The company is no stranger to controversy. In 2018, Sir Martin Sorrell, who founded and led WPP for three decades, stepped down amid allegations he used company funds to pay for prostitutes. Sorrell has since denied allegations he visited a prostitute, and paid with WPP’s money. A spokesman has previously said: ” Sir Martin left WPP as a good leaver and I am surprised there [are] any remaining questions of his expenses.” The major market indexes keep going up, but the notion that the stock market might be too frothy for its own good continues to be downplayed.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/trump-suggests-north-carolina-residents-vote-twice-which-is-illegal-2020-09-02?mod=home-page",
    "text": "President Donald Trump on Wednesday suggested North Carolina residents should try to vote twice — by mail and in person — in the November election, seemingly encouraging them to attempt to commit voter fraud in an effort to test the state’s mail-in voting system. Trump made the comments during an interview with WECT News of Wilmington, N.C., when a reporter asked if he’s confident in the state’s voting system, which could see 600,000 absentee votes cast this fall. “They will vote and then they are going to have to check their vote by going to the poll and voting that way because if it tabulates, then they won’t be able to do that,” Trump said. “So let them send it in, and let them go vote. And if their system is as good as they say it is, then obviously they won’t be able to vote. If it isn’t tabulated, they will be able to vote. So that’s the way it is, and that’s what they should do.” Voting twice is illegal under both North Carolina and federal law. In North Carolina, it is also illegal “to induce” someone else to fraudulently cast a ballot. Trump has been a frequent and vocal critic of mail-in voting, claiming — without evidence — that it is susceptible to fraud. Trump himself has voted by mail a number of times. WECT said the way North Carolina’s system is set up, it is “clerically impossible for a person to vote twice,” because once the mail-in ballot is received, the voter would not be allowed to cast a vote in person. When asked about Trump’s suggestion Wednesday night on CNN, U.S. Attorney General William Barr said Trump was “trying to make a point,” but declined to say whether voting twice is illegal (it unequivocally is), telling host Wolf Blitzer “I don’t know what the law in the particular state says.” Separately, federal prosecutors in North Carolina charged 19 non-citizens with voter fraud Wednesday, accusing them of illegally casting ballots in 2016. Few details were disclosed, but one defendant’s attorney told the Associated Press: “These cases are clearly timed for partisan political purposes.” Copyright © 2020 MarketWatch, Inc.

    "title": "The coronavirus may remain in the body for a month or more — but does that mean you’re still contagious?",
    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-coronavirus-may-remain-in-the-body-for-a-month-or-more-but-does-that-mean-youre-still-contagious-2020-09-02?mod=home-page",
    "text": "Health experts are learning that recovering from the coronavirus takes time. In fact, a new study of roughly 4,500 Italian COVID-19 patients published on Wednesday evening found that it takes 30 days on average for SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes the COVID-19 infection, to leave the body after the first positive test result. It takes 36 days on average for the virus to clear the body after a person starts showing symptoms. And it can linger even longer in older patients and in those with more severe illness, according to the peer-reviewed manuscript published in the online journal BMJ Open. While it’s not clear from just this observational report whether someone is still infectious during this 30-or-so-day window, the authors recommend that patients testing positive for COVID-19 get tested again in four or more weeks after their symptoms first appear in order to minimize the risk of spreading the virus. Indeed, the long-term effects of COVID-19 are only just beginning to come to light, roughly half a year into the pandemic. Some “long hauler” coronavirus patients have continued to suffer symptoms and coronavirus-related health issues for months after their initial infections, including shortness of breath, extreme muscle weakness and fatigue, and brain fog. The CDC has warned that one in five previously healthy young adults weren’t back to their usual health 14 to 21 days after testing positive. And another study found more than half (55%) of coronavirus patients still had neurological problems three months later. What’s more, this new BMJ Open report also found that the rate of false negative test results appeared to be high early in the coronavirus patients’ recovery. The study subjects were tested 15 days after their first positive swabs, 14 days after their second swabs, and nine days after their third. Those who tested negative were tested again — and the negative results were only confirmed in 79% of those cases, suggesting a rate of one false negative out of every five negative test results. The authors fear that the high rate of false negatives, plus the evidence that the virus remains in the body for more than a month, puts COVID-19 patients at risk of “unwittingly passing on the infection” as they return to work or school believing that they are all better. But the current guidance from the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that most COVID-19 patients are indeed in the clear after isolating themselves for 10 to 13 days. And those with mild to moderate illness, whose symptoms have resolved, can then leave quarantine without even getting tested for COVID-19 again. The CDC did not immediately respond to a MarketWatch request for comment about whether it has considered extending the length of time that COVID-19 patients should isolate themselves, or whether testing guidelines should be adjusted. The WHO notes that while some research has suggested that patients whose symptoms have resolved may indeed still test positive for COVID-19 for many weeks afterward, “these patients are not likely to be infectious and therefore are unlikely to be able to transmit the virus to another person.” That’s because the amount of virus a person is carrying, or their viral load, may be too low for that person to be contagious. In fact, a recent New York Times analysis suggests that many people getting diagnosed with COVID-19 could be carrying “relatively insignificant amounts” of the virus, which means that they are probably not contagious. This is because the most widely used diagnostic COVID-19 tests are PCR tests that detect the presence of the virus’ genetic material in the body. And these sensitive diagnostics can flag not only live virus samples in the body, but also genetic fragments left over from an earlier infection. (These traces are kind of like how strands of a person’s hair or skin cells can be found in a room after the person is long gone.) That’s not to say these standard diagnostic tests should be thrown out the window for being too sensitive, however. The Food and Drug Administration told the Times that when people are first infected with COVID-19, for example, they may also carry a low viral load. And tests that are less sensitive could miss these cases. The CDC also notes that someone could test negative for COVID-19 early in their infection. Research suggests that the most contagious window for COVID-19 tends to be between one to three days before someone shows symptoms (with the highest viral loads on the day someone becomes symptomatic), up until about five days afterward, according to the World Health Organization. And this level of contagiousness appears to be one to two weeks for asymptomatic persons, and up to three weeks or more for patients with mild to moderate disease. The bottom line: This is still a new virus, and health experts are still learning about how it spreads. People may be carrying the virus in their bodies longer than researchers first suspected, but it’s unclear exactly how long they will be contagious. A new study published in JAMA Pediatrics suggests that children, including asymptomatic ones, may shed the virus for weeks. So what should people take from the latest research? They should keep practicing key social-distancing measures, monitoring for symptoms, and they should get tested if they start showing symptoms or suspect that they have been exposed. Even those who test negative — either because they haven’t been exposed to the virus, or because they have recovered from it — should continue taking steps to protect themselves and those around them. This includes: washing their hands often; avoiding close contact with people outside of their household by staying at least six feet apart; and covering their nose and mouth with a face mask around others, even if they don’t feel sick. There were 25.8 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide as of Wednesday afternoon, according to the Johns Hopkins data, and at least 857,877 people have died. More than 17 million people are confirmed to have tested positive and recovered. Follow more of MarketWatch’s coronavirus coverage here.

The Tesla short, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange, jumped 40.5% on Wednesday afternoon. It is listed in London  because U.S. regulatory rules frowned at the notion of a leverage single-stock ETP products,  William Rhind CEO and founder of Granite Shares told MarketWatch in a Tuesday interview.  “It’s complicated.” On Tuesday, the short-Tesla ETP saw 2.8 million shares trade hands in a flurry of activity as the stock sank 4.7%. On Wednesday, about 700,000 Tesla shares changed hands, as the underlying stock sold off by at least 10% at the peak, with that drop for the Elon Musk-run company meeting the commonly used criteria for an asset-price correction. To be sure, the triple-leveraged ETF has also experienced withering losses to this point, and is down 80.5% in the past 30-day period, according to FactSet data. Tesla’s stock, which recently completed a 5-for-1 stock split, consummated on Monday, has been one of the hardest charging stocks of the pandemic era. Tesla’s shares are up 430% so far this year as investors perceive the stock as a bet on the future of the growing electric-vehicle industry or as an investment that may be more resilient to the turbulence in the market inspired partly by the COVID-19 pandemic. Bearish investors, however, like ones who might buy the triple-leverage, vehicle to short, or bet on falls in value of Tesla’s shares, have pointed out that there is little justification for the precipitous rise of the company which offers no dividend and which has a price-to-earnings ratio–a common measure of a stock’s value–of 1,153, according to FactSet data. GraniteShares also offers a Graniteshares 3X Long Tesla Daily ETP that also trades on the LSE. It was down 22% on Wednesday but has enjoyed a nearly 200% increase over the past 30-day period. GraniteShares says it offered the risky bets on the market because it provides investors a low-cost chance to take a position in those companies. For example, the triple-leverage short ETP finished Wednesday trade at 19 cents and a share of the triple-long ETF is $38.50. To be certain, GraniteShares isn’t the only fund provider touting leveraged, single-stock ETPs but the leverage on its products might be the most extreme in terms of Tesla. Fund provider Leverage Shares offers 1x and 2x leveraged Tesla ETP. Those funds launched in June.   “Given the heightened interest in short & leveraged offerings in the current volatile environment, we offer these leveraged and inverse ETPs as a safer alternative to trading contract for differences (CFDs) or buying on margin,”  Raj Sheth, director solutions at Leverage Shares, was quoted as saying by ETF Stream. It’s important to note that ETPs aren’t like plain vanilla exchange-traded funds, which attempt to mimic an index. Complex, leveraged ETPs like those for GraniteShares and Leverage Shares represent only a sliver of the multi-trillion dollar ETP market but they also have inherent risks of losing a lot of money. On the heels of a huge month for stocks in August, our call of the day says investors need to get ready for at least two pullbacks this year, with history as a guide.

    "title": "Opinion: How retirees should invest in a time of record-low interest rates",
    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/retirees-are-working-harder-just-to-avoid-falling-behind-2020-09-02?mod=home-page",
    "text": "Retirees these days are caught on a treadmill. Their retirement portfolios have become addicted to low and declining interest rates, both to preserve and possibly increase the value of their bondholdings but also to keep the stock bull market chugging along. Yet those ever-lower interest rates mean that it now takes more money to purchase the same retirement standard of living. In other words, retirees are running harder just to stay even. One way of appreciating this treadmill is to focus on how much less of an annuity you can purchase today with $100,000 than you could have 10 or 20 years ago. This is illustrated in the accompanying chart, which plots the monthly annuity payout that a single 65-year old male could have purchased with $100,000. Two decades ago, that $100,000 could have purchased a guaranteed lifetime income of $650 a month. With $100,000 today, in contrast, you can only purchase a guaranteed monthly payment of $465. The chart also plots the yield on triple-A rated corporate bonds. Notice the striking correlation with annuity payout rates. Vincent Deluard, head of global macro strategy at investment firm StoneX, refers to this as a “death loop”: Retirees “need lower rates so that equities keep rising despite the lack of healthy economic growth. At the same time, lower yields…prevent them from having any hope of meeting their return targets.” How can retirees get off this treadmill? The only solution I can see is to take some money off the table, so to speak. And I don’t just mean lowering your equity exposure; I also mean reducing your bond exposure as well. That’s because both asset classes are stuck on this same treadmill. I suggest you consider buying an annuity with some of the proceeds of lowering your equity and fixed-income exposures. That might seem surprising, given the above chart, but there are at least two compelling reasons to nevertheless consider one: • This treadmill can’t last forever, even if it can continue a while longer. As Deluard puts it, “I am entirely certain that the system is unsustainable over the long-term…Although I cannot predict when, I am certain that the gods of math and reality will eventually punish the mistaken disciples of the bull market cult.” If the market were to fall from here, the annuity you could purchase would be even less attractive than the one you could buy today. • In any case, you shouldn’t exaggerate the extent to which today’s annuity payout rates are less attractive than they were two decades ago. That’s because, after adjusting for inflation and prevailing interest rates, the situation isn’t as bad as it seems. Consider the net present value, or NPV, of the annuity payouts that my hypothetical 65-year old single male is able to purchase with $100,000, assuming his life expectancy is equal to what the Social Security Administration assumes is average for his age and gender, and using the triple-A rated corporate bond yield as the discount rate. On those assumptions, the annuity he could have purchased at the beginning of 2003 had a NPV of $77,702; the NPV of the comparable annuity purchased today is $73,188. How much of your retirement portfolio should you allocate to an annuity? Some retirement analysts recommend about one-third. For example, David Blanchett, head of retirement research at Morningstar, analyzed 78,000 possible retirement scenarios based on different assumptions about the markets’ rates of return, life expectancies, varying allocations to an annuity, and so forth. In each case, he calculated the annuity allocation that would have produced the best outcome for the retiree. On average, he found, that the optimal allocation was 30.52%. It should go without saying, but I’ll say it nonetheless: You should exercise great care in choosing the correct annuity product. There are many different annuity products, and comparing them can be hopelessly complex. Some come with excessive fees. By all means you should consult with a qualified financial planner who is skilled in analyzing the pluses and minuses of each bell and whistle. What if you hate the idea of reducing your equity exposure and thereby forfeiting the gain you would realize if the stock market continues to rise ever further? There is an annuity product that at least partially responds to this fear of missing out. Known as a Fixed Income Annuity (FIA), such an annuity never goes down in value but returns a percentage of the market’s gain in those years in which it rises. As always, the devil is in the details. I devoted a column in early April to some of those details, and I refer you to it for a more complete discussion. To repeat, furthermore, make sure you discuss the possibilities with a qualified financial planner. Mark Hulbert is a regular contributor to MarketWatch.

    "text": "Tyler Perry loves when people say he came from “humble beginnings.” To the high school dropout, that just means a “dirt poor” upbringing, which was most definitely the case for Perry. He was raised in poverty and spent time roaming the streets of New Orleans as a homeless playwright searching for a break. Those hungry days are long gone, however, as Perry, now a true media mogul, just climbed his way on to the Forbes billionaire list. He reportedly has earned more than $1.4 billion since blowing up back 2005 and owns a massive studio worth about $280 million. Here’s how Forbes breaks down Perry’s wealth. “Ownership changes everything,” Perry explained to Forbes, referring to his studio, which sits on what was once a Confederate military stronghold. “I own the lights. I own the sets. So that’s where the difference is. Because I own everything, my returns are higher.” Perry is best known for his string of movie hits based on a character named Madea, a tough old lady he created and stars as in 11 films. Forbes says Perry, America’s seventh Black billionaire, currently has “a clear path” to membership in the Forbes 400, which means he’ll have to accrue more than $2 billion in net worth, according to 2019’s threshold. Perry spends his wealth on homes in Atlanta, New York, Los Angeles, and Jackson Hole, Wyoming, as well as on two private planes, Forbes reported. Wall Street has another explanation for why the stock market has been on fire, which could also help investors understand some tech stocks’ red hot winning streaks lately.

    "text": "Robinhood Markets Inc. faces a civil fraud investigation over its early failure to fully disclose its practice of selling clients’ orders to high-speed trading firms, people familiar with the matter said. The investigation is at an advanced stage and the company could have to pay a fine exceeding $10 million if it agrees to settle the Securities and Exchange Commission probe, one of the people said. A deal, however, is unlikely to be announced this month, the people said, and the two sides haven’t formally negotiated a proposed fine, the person said. A Robinhood spokeswoman declined to comment on the investigation or any talks with regulators, but said: “We strive to maintain constructive relationships with our regulators and to cooperate fully with them.” An SEC spokeswoman declined to comment. The probe is the latest headache for the upstart brokerage firm that was founded in 2013 and has developed a hugely popular app that allows individuals to trade stocks, options and cryptocurrencies without paying any commissions. While Robinhood has seen phenomenal growth this year, the Menlo Park, Calif.-based firm has faced setbacks such as outages that prevented customers from trading, the cancellation of its plans to expand to the U.K. and fallout from the suicide of a 20-year-old Robinhood customer who thought he had lost money from a sophisticated options trade.

COVID-19 deaths significantly reduced by use of steroids, analysis says. Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc. shares  slid 8% Wednesday, after Muddy Waters said it has taken a short position in the stock, which has been boosted this year by high hopes for its COVID-19 vaccine candidate. The short selling firm, led by investor Carson Block, said in a series of tweets that a recent court decision \"makes it clear that Inovio lacks manufacturing capacity to get remotely near purported goal of 1 million doses in 2020 and 100 million in 2021.\" The decision was made in a case Inovio brought against GeneOne Life Science Inc. and VGXI Inc. over a supply agreement. Muddy Waters also noted that Citron Research, another short seller, had compared Inovio to scandal-ridden Theranos earlier this year and called it 'one of the longest running and most blatant stock promotion schemes ever witnessed.\" \"We concur,\" said Muddy Waters. Inovio makes DNA based vaccines and immunotherapies for a range of diseases, including HPV and Zika, but hasn't yet had a product approved for treatment. The company is currently conducting a Phase 1 trial of its vaccine candidate, INO-4800, and has said it expects to start Phase 2/3 trials in September. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Shares are still up 218% in the year to date. Copyright © 2020 MarketWatch, Inc. All rights reserved."

    "text": "E-cigarette maker Juul Labs Inc. said it is planning another significant round of layoffs and considering halting sales across Europe and Asia. That could mean pulling out of as many as 11 countries and shrinking the startup’s footprint to its core markets of the U.S., Canada and the U.K. Juul cut about one-third of its 3,000 workers earlier this year and already has halted sales of its vaporizers in several countries. The once fast-growing company has been scaling back its operations to combat a sharp drop in sales. It currently has about 2,200 employees. Widely blamed by parents and government officials for a surge in teen vaping in the U.S., Juul has faced regulatory crackdowns and investigations into its marketing practices over past two years. Now its sales are falling as Reynolds American Inc.’s Vuse e-cigarette brand gains market share and some vapers switch back to traditional cigarettes. Juul Chief Executive K.C. Crosthwaite told employees in an email Wednesday that the business units under review don’t generate enough revenue to support further spending there. He said the cuts would allow the company to invest in developing new products, in technology to curb youth use and in scientific research that could help the company demonstrate to regulators that its products are less harmful than cigarettes. Juul has submitted to the Food and Drug Administration a new version of its vaporizer designed to unlock only for users at least 21 years old, according to people familiar with the matter.

    "text": "CrowdStrike Holdings Inc.  shares retreated from 2020’s meteoric rise in the extended session Wednesday after the cloud-based cybersecurity company topped Wall Street estimates, with more businesses seeking to protect their systems as employees work from home. Revenue rose to $199 million from $108.1 million in the year-ago quarter. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had estimated a loss of a penny a share on revenue of $188.6 million, based on CrowdStrike’s forecast adjusted loss of 2 cents a share to break-even on revenue of $185.8 million to $190.3 million . Shares declined 7% after hours, following a 1.1% decline in the regular session to close at $142.07, after nearly tripling in price year to date. Since the COVID-19 pandemic has forced millions to log onto corporate networks from home, CrowdStrike has benefited from the need for more dynamic security measures, reporting its first-ever adjusted profit last quarter.  CrowdStrike has been publicly traded for a little more than a year, following its June 2019 IPO that priced at $34 a share. CrowdStrike also gained notoriety less than a year ago after President Donald Trump referenced the company in his  phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in trying to get information on  Democratic political rival Joe Biden and his son. In the first half of 2020, CrowdStrike’s Kurtz said the number of “distinct and sophisticated” intrusions into sensitive systems jumped more than 150%, and that the company stopped about 41,000 potential breaches, more than all of last year. “Many of the security leaders we spoke with believe that experiencing a breach now, while their business is under extreme stress due to the impact of COVID, will be far more detrimental to their business versus last year,” Kurtz said. Annual recurring revenue, a software-as-a-service metric that shows how much revenue the company can expect based on subscriptions, rose 87% to $791 million for the quarter, while the Street expected $732 million.  Kurtz said CrowdStrike added a record $104 million in new ARR in the second quarter, and landed the “second-largest deal in the company history” with an unidentified customer. CrowdStrike expects an adjusted fiscal third-quarter loss of a penny a share to break even on revenue of $210.6 million to $215 million, while analysts forecast a loss of 5 cents a share on revenue of $195.9 million, according to FactSet. With much of the market recovering from its March lows, it is no wonder that investors are looking for opportunities in beaten-up sectors. And bank stocks certainly fit the bill.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/united-airlines-plans-to-furlough-16000-workers-fewer-than-expected-2020-09-02?mod=home-page",
    "text": "United Airlines said Wednesday it plans to furlough 16,370 employees in October, a smaller number than the airline predicted in July because thousands of workers agreed to leave with the travel industry facing a slow recovery from the pandemic. Airline officials had outlined 36,000 potential furloughs in July. Since then, thousands of workers took early retirement, buyouts, or long-term leaves of absence. Flight attendants will bear the brunt of the cuts, with 6,920 getting furlough notices. About 2,850 pilots, 2,260 airport-based employees, 2,010 maintenance workers and 1,400 management and support staff would also lose their jobs. The figures do not include the 7,400 employees who took buyouts or early retirement. Up to 20,000 more accepted reduced work schedules or took voluntary leaves lasting up to 13 months. Most union employees in the airline industry whose jobs are cut have rehiring rights — management and administrative staff generally do not. United began the year with 96,000 employees, 84% of whom were represented by unions. The flight attendants’ union said United’s announcement understates the job losses. The union said more than 15,000 flight attendants will leave the United payroll unless Washington approves more payroll aid for airlines, and another 3,400 who stay to keep health insurance will get no guarantee of work or income. “Where will we go? The unemployment line,” said Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants. “The situation in the airline industry is not better than July when furlough notices went out. It’s actually worse.” United officials said they were still discussing ways to limit pilot furloughs. Airlines are cautious about furloughing too many pilots because federal requirements for ongoing training mean it takes longer to bring them back. Airlines don’t need all their workers because air travel has plunged during the pandemic. Even with a modest recovery since April, U.S. air travel is down about 70% from a year ago, costing the airlines billions in revenue. The airlines have cut schedules — United’s schedule this month is only 37% of its schedule in September 2019 — slashed expenses and borrowed billions to survive the pandemic. Josh Earnest, a United senior vice president, said the Chicago-based airline doesn’t expect travel to return to normal until a vaccine for COVID-19 is widely available, and that the recovery is likely to be uneven. The airline expects to recall furloughed workers piecemeal, he indicated. “We don’t have to snap everybody back at the same time,” he told reporters. “We can basically build our workforce as we need it and as our schedule grows and as demand recovers.” Airlines that accepted federal aid to cover payrolls have been barred from furloughing or laying off workers since March. United took $5 billion in payroll cash and loans. United and other airlines and their unions are lobbying for another round of payroll support that would run through next March, but the proposal is in limbo because of stalled negotiations between the White House and congressional Democrats over another large virus-relief measure. President Donald Trump repeated Tuesday that his administration plans to help the airlines, but he didn’t give any specifics.

    "title": "U.S. budget deficit to hit record $3.3 trillion this year, CBO says",
    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/u-s-budget-deficit-to-hit-record-3-3-trillion-this-year-cbo-says-11599070944?mod=home-page",
    "text": "The U.S. government will run its biggest budget shortfall ever this year, at $3.311 trillion, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said Wednesday. The government’s fiscal year ends Sept. 30 and the record fiscal deficit had long been seen as a fait accompli in light of the massive levels of government support for the economy in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. “This pandemic is tragic on so many fronts and today’s massive borrowing is a cost of mitigating this pain. The warning bells this report contains should not cause a premature end to borrowing, but a commitment to dealing with the debt at the appropriate time,” said Maya MacGuineas, president of the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. The Treasury and the Office of Management and Budget will announce the official results sometime in October, if the Trump administration sticks to the usual release pattern. The CBO number was, however, slightly better than had been expected in April. Back then, the CBO was projecting a $3.7 trillion deficit for this budget year and a $2.1 trillion shortfall in 2021. The projected 2021 deficit was trimmed back to $1.810 trillion in the new forecast. In comparison to the size of the economy, a measure most economists say better reflects the deficit’s fiscal burden, the 2020 deficit would be the largest since 1945, at 16.0% of Gross Domestic Product. That would be the fourth-largest deficit in proportion to the size of the economy, according to data kept by the Office of Management and Budget, after the years 1943 through 1945. The CBO projected most of the budgetary impact of the pandemic would be focused in 2020 and 2021, as its 10-year forecast window remained mostly unchanged from estimates made before the virus’ impact was known. “The cumulative deficit between 2021 and 2030 is projected to total $13.0 trillion (5.0 percent of GDP over that period), about the same as CBO projected in March. Lower projected wages, salaries, and corporate profits, as well as recent legislation and other changes, increase deficits, but that change is more than offset by lower projected interest rates and inflation, which decrease deficits,” CBO said. The report comes as Congress and the White House are likely to begin in September hammering out another bill to respond to the pandemic, despite being far apart on how much to spend. Four earlier coronavirus bills, including the $1.7 trillion CARES Act passed in March, were estimated by the CBO to cost $2.404 trillion combined. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, remain about $900 billion dollars apart on the next bill, with Pelosi arguing for the higher number of $2.2 trillion. Any spending resulting from another coronavirus bill would probably come too late to affect the 2020 fiscal year. For this year, the CBO said spending would total about 32% of GDP, also the highest level since 1945. Revenues were expected to fall to about 16% of GDP. The revenue picture CBO projected showed the sharp economic turn caused by the pandemic. Revenues were up by 6% overall in the first six months of the budget year, October 2019 to March, before dropping by 13% in the second half of the year. Offsetting some of that, though, was a sharp drop in  borrowing costs. While the amount of debt rose by 20% over 2019, net interest costs were projected to actually fall by $37 billion, the CBO said. “That drop occurs primarily because interest rates have been much lower in 2020 than they were in 2019,” CBO said. Over the 2020-’30 window, though, the  budget picture remained grim. The publicly held-debt-to-GDP percentage was estimated to hit 98% in 2020 and continue rising steadily to almost 109% in 2030. In that year, the debt was estimated to hit $33.457 trillion, or more than $13 trillion more than 2020’s level. On a nominal basis, the projected annual deficits shrink quickly in 2020 and 2021, then pause before rising near the end of the decade. The lowest projected deficit over the next decade is $1.080 trillion in 2027. “While managing the COVID-19 crisis must remain the top priority, whomever is sworn in as president next year will also need a plan to dig us out of this hole once the economy is stronger,” MacGuineas said. Michael Linden, executive director of Groundworks Collaborative, an advocacy group for progressive and inclusive economic policy, said the deficit numbers should not deter policymakers from thinking big. “Interest rates are at historic lows and it’s clearer than ever that the deficit isn’t a major concern — so the highest priority, and really the only responsible thing for our government to do, is support workers and families and make the major investments needed to end this crisis and put our economy on strong footing,” he said. The CBO also released a report taking a look at the health of government trust funds and concluded three will be unable to pay out the amounts required by law within the next decade. It said the Highway Trust Fund would hit its exhaustion date in 2021, with the Hospital Insurance portion of Medicare following in 2024 and Social Security’s Disability insurance fund in 2026.

    "text": "The number of confirmed cases of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 worldwide edged closer to 26 million on Wednesday, as experts sounded the alarm on the Trump administration’s decision not to participate in an international effort to develop and distribute a COVID-19 vaccine that is backed by the World Health Organization. The news was not surprising, given that Trump has repeatedly criticized the WHO, calling it pro-China and is pulling the U.S. out of the world’s leading health organization. Rep. Ami Bera, D-Calif., said the decision was shortsighted and will hamper the battle to end the pandemic. “Joining COVAX is a simple measure to guarantee U.S. access to a vaccine — no matter who develops it first,” tweeted Bera, a medical doctor. “This go-it-alone approach leaves America at risk of not getting a vaccine.” The news came at a time when public health experts are concerned that even the top U.S. health agencies are becoming increasingly politicized under the current administration as Trump consistently rejects the advice of the doctors and scientists that head them and applying pressure on them to act as he, and his political fortunes, would prefer. Trump has played down the pandemic from the outset, has been inconsistent in promoting the safety measures they insist are key to containing the spread and even accused the Food and Drug Administration of being part of the “deep state.” The latest fear is that the U.S. is already pursuing an unstated herd-immunity policy, one that is backed by a new member of the White House pandemic team. The Washington Post reported this week that Dr. Scott Atlas, a neuroradiologist from Stanford’s Hoover Institution, is pushing for the U.S. to follow Sweden’s example, which has been widely criticized for a death toll that is far higher than that of neighboring countries. Atlas is not an infectious-disease expert or an epidemiologist. Herd immunity is the notion that once a high proportion of a population has contracted or been vaccinated against an infectious disease, the likelihood of others in the population being infected is drastically reduced. Sweden did not lock down or even enforce restrictions on movement, relying instead on its citizens to responsibly follow safety guidelines. The country has recorded 57.08 deaths from COVID-19 per 100,000 people, just ahead of the U.S.’s 56.44 per 100,000 people, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University. By comparison, neighboring Finland has had just 6.09 deaths per 100,000 people, the data show. Gregg Gonsalves, assistant professor of epidemiology of microbial diseases at the Yale School of Public Health and co-director of the Global Health Justice Partnership, told Democracy Now on Monday that the U.S. is now ‘implicitly’ taking a herd-immunity tack. “Many people in the public health community have watched this with horror, the sort of implicit herd-immunity strategy,” he said. The Trump administration realizes it is politically toxic, he said, “so they don’t want to use the phrase, but if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it is a duck. And this is essentially a herd-immunity strategy.” Gonsalves joined those criticizing the head of the FDA, Dr. Stephen Hahn, for kowtowing to the White House in granting an emergency-use authorization for the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine, which has been found ineffective and potentially dangerous in clinical trials, and more recently granting an EUA for convalescent plasma, which has not been fully tested, and announcing it in a televised briefing promoted by Trump as a major event. A National Institutes of Health advisory group focused on COVID-19 said Tuesday that the efficacy and safety of convalescent plasma as a treatment for hospitalized coronavirus patients is still unknown, based on its assessment of published and unpublished clinical data. Hahn said at the weekend that he would consider an EUA for a potential vaccine, even before the end of Phase 3 trials. “The danger about the vaccine EUA before Phase 3 trial results are out is much more dire, because we give treatments to the sick and, in this case, to many people who are hospitalized,” said Gonsalves. “Vaccines go to millions of people. We depend on them to be effective, so people don’t get the wrong impression about what they should be doing in terms of social distancing and other behavior because they’re vaccinated.” The newly influential Atlas is also skeptical of face masks and does not believe that children can pass on the virus, according to a New York Times report. It cited one expert, Dr. Carlos del Rio, an infectious-disease expert at Emory University, as saying Trump did not like the advice he was getting from long-standing public health experts including Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Diseases, and Dr. Deborah Birx, coordinator of the White House task force, while Atlas is saying what the president wants to hear. • Australia has entered its first recession almost 30 years because of the pandemic, the BBC reported on Wednesday. Australian GDP fell 7% in the April-through-June quarter, after a fall of 0.3% in the first quarter. An economy is deemed to be in recession once it suffers two consecutive quarters of negative growth. Australia was the only major economy to avoid recession during the 2008 financial crisis, when it was buoyed by demand from China for its commodities and natural resources. • Also from Australia, former Prime Minister Tony Abbott is facing a backlash after he suggested that some elderly patients with the virus should be allowed to die, letting nature take its course. Abbott said politicians were not “thinking like health economists trained to pose uncomfortable questions about the level of deaths we might have to live with.” He made the comments in a speech at the Policy Exchange in London. • A surge in news cases in South Korea is mostly being led by older people, the Guardian reported. More than 40% of the new cases in the country involve people who are older than 60, the paper said. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 267 new cases on Tuesday, boosting the total to 20,449, with 326 total deaths. The latest rise in cases is pushing hospitals in Seoul to capacity with just 3% of beds now available for non-COVID critical cases, compared with 22% some 10 days ago. • Italy’s former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has tested positive for COVID-19, according to media reports. The 83-year old, who was PM in four different governments, is isolating at a home near Milan, according to a statement distributed by his staff. Berlusconi recently visited Sardinia, which experienced a spike in cases in August as tourists from across Italy arrived for vacation, Reuters reported. • Germany is not going to have another lockdown in winter, according to its health minister, Jens Spahn, speaking at a press briefing. Spahn said experts are learning more about the virus every day and would not make the same decisions if cases spike again in the colder months. “We are learning where the dangers are greatest, sadly when we socialize and celebrate together,” he said, according to a Reuters report. There are now 25.8 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide, according to the Johns Hopkins data, and at least 858,661 people have died. More than 17 million people are confirmed to have tested positive and recovered. The U.S. has the highest case tally at 6.09 million and the highest death toll at 185,123. Brazil is second with 3.9 million cases and 122,596 deaths. India is third with 3.8 million cases and 66,333 deaths. Russia, Peru, South Africa and Colombia are next as measured by cases. Mexico has 606,036 cases and 65,241 deaths, the fourth highest in the world, followed by the U.K. with its 339,420 cases and 41,592 deaths, the most in Europe and fifth highest in the world. China, where the illness was first reported late last year, says it has 89,942 confirmed cases and  4,726 deaths. A new study by Reykjavik-based deCODE Genetics, a subsidiary of the U.S. biotech company Amgen, with several hospitals, universities and health officials in Iceland, found that antibodies that people make to fight the new coronavirus last for at least four months after diagnosis and do not fade quickly, as some earlier reports suggested, the Associated Press reported. The study was based on tests on more than 30,000 people in Iceland, a popular center for medical research because of its small and closely related population and a long history of keeping careful medical records. Some smaller studies previously suggested that antibodies may disappear quickly and that some people with few or no symptoms may not make many at all. The results don’t necessarily mean that all countries’ populations will be the same, or that every person has this sort of response. Other scientists recently documented cases where people have been reinfected with the coronavirus months after their first bout. There is growing scientific consensus that steroids like dexamethasone should be the leading treatment option for severely ill COVID-19 patients, according to three new studies published Wednesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association, MarketWatch’s Jaimy Lee reported. Researchers at the University of Oxford in the U.K. reported in mid-June that low doses of dexamethasone reduced deaths in hospitalized COVID-19 patients on ventilators by one-third or those receiving oxygen support by one-fifth. The new studies reinforce the benefits of steroids when treating some severely ill coronavirus patients. “These trials and the meta-analysis have strengthened confidence, further defined the benefit, and shifted usual care of COVID-19-related ARDS to include corticosteroids,” researchers wrote in an accompanying editorial. “However, many clinically important questions remain.” The World Health Organization on Wednesday recommended corticosteroids for patients with severe forms of COVID-19. Private-sector companies added or regained 428,000 jobs in August, ADP said Wednesday, but the modest gain won’t dispel worries about a slowdown in hiring over the summer as new outbreaks threatened the economy’s recovery from the worst of the pandemic, MarketWatch’s Jeffry Bartash reported. Wall Street economists had forecast an increase of 1 million private-sector jobs, according to Econoday. The increase in hiring last month surpassed a revised job gain of 212,000 in July, the giant payroll processor said. Initially ADP had reported that 167,000 new jobs were created in that month. The economy has recouped fewer than half of the 20 million–plus jobs lost in the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic. ”The U.S. labor-market recovery continued at a fairly sluggish pace in August,” said senior economist Andrew Grantham of CIBC Economics. A separate report found factory orders rose 6.4% in July in a third straight monthly increase, reflecting a rebound in manufacturing after the economy reopened. Economists polled by MarketWatch had forecast a 6.2% gain. Wall Street has another explanation for why the stock market has been on fire, which could also help investors understand some tech stocks’ red hot winning streaks lately.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-university-created-its-own-covid-19-test-and-is-testing-students-twice-a-week-experts-are-watching-to-see-if-its-enough-to-prevent-an-outbreak-11598648724?mod=home-page",
    "text": "Over the roughly week and a half that Ian Katsnelson has been back at his college, the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, the junior has developed a “mini competition” with his friends to see who can finish the process of taking their COVID-19 tests the fastest. “The hardest part for sure is garnering enough saliva,” Katsnelson said of the rapid saliva test, which was created by scientists at the school. He’s perfecting his strategy for his trips to the tents where testing takes place: “I’ve built up my saliva in line before I’ve even gotten inside the tent, so I can get in and get out real quick.” Hallie Workman, a PhD candidate in communications at U of I said, “there’s a lot of scouting that goes on” as students try to find out which of the more than a dozen testing tents on campus have the shortest line. “I have my tent in my time of day that always works well,” Workman, 30, said. “You just sit there trying not to make eye contact with people as you dribble spit into a tube.” These were just some of the rituals that marked an unusual first week of classes at the University of Illinois, which is requiring students, faculty and staff accessing campus to get tested for COVID-19 twice a week as part of its reopening plan. As colleges across the country have sent students home or back to remote classes amid COVID outbreaks, officials at the University of Illinois are hopeful that their approach to mitigating the pandemic’s spread on campus — which includes a test developed at the school that is now being performed under the Federal Drug Administration’s emergency use authorization — will be enough to keep students in some in-person classes through November.  It’s not a small undertaking. The school had 51,000 students in the fall of 2019. Since July 6, the school has processed 121,333 COVID tests and in the five days leading up to Friday, which marked the end of the first week of classes, the school administered 47,075 tests and had a 0.75% positivity rate. For context, there were roughly 730,000 COVID tests administered in the entire U.S. on a recent August day, according to Johns Hopkins University’s Coronavirus Resource Center. On Aug. 24, U of I administered more than 17,000 tests alone. So far, the number of positive cases is in line with what the school’s modelers predicted — well under 400 cases in the week before classes began. The next couple of weeks will be a “defining moment” for U of I as it works to prevent the spread of COVID-19 on campus and in the community, said Robert Jones, the school’s chancellor. “We know that people are watching,” he told MarketWatch. And indeed, according to Joshua Salomon, the director of the Prevention Policy Modeling Lab at Stanford University, “people are really going to be watching this carefully,” describing the efforts the school has taken as “encouraging.” “We don’t know whether it’s going to succeed,” he added. “What we do know is that the likelihood of succeeding without testing is very small.” At many universities that have reopened their campuses for in-person instruction, students may have been tested upon reentry to university housing or campus more broadly and may be subject to random screening. But models from researchers at Yale School of Public Health and U of I, indicate that in order to prevent an outbreak on a college campus — and not just monitor one — students and those interacting with them regularly need to be tested multiple times per week. U of I may be the only university in the country hewing to that standard. Officials will know around Sept. 25, one month and one day after the start of classes, if their efforts have worked, said Rebecca Lee Smith, an associate professor of pathobiology at U of I who is part of the team that developed the school’s testing and other protocols. “We’re going to be keeping track of how well we’re doing going from test results to isolation to contact tracing and quarantine,” Smith said. They’ll also be looking out for new positive cases, a sign of community spread. The outcome that they’re hoping for “is to minimize the infections, get it under control and to protect the health of campus and the community,” Smith said. The school began working to prepare for the fall semester shortly after classes went remote in the spring, said Martin Burke, a chemistry professor at the University of Illinois and chair of the SHIELD committee, the team that is guiding the university’s approach to reopening. They realized relatively quickly that in order to bring students back to campus, they would need to test frequently and get results back rapidly, something that wasn’t going to be possible with a nasal swab test. That led to what Burke described as a “Manhattan Project-style effort,” at the university  to develop their own test. Ultimately they were able to do so in about six weeks, he said. Now the school is working to expand access to the test to the rest of the state of Illinois and even to other areas of the country and around the world. “Testing is not a silver bullet, but it’s a very powerful component,” Burke said. In addition to the testing, the school developed an app where students, faculty and staff receive test results and reminders, and a boarding pass-style image indicating a negative COVID test that allow them access to campus buildings. Users can also enable the app to notify them when they’ve been in close proximity to someone who tested positive for COVID through the use of an anonymized Bluetooth scanning system. U of I is also taking many of the same steps as other campuses  — moving large lecture courses online, moving smaller in-person courses to large rooms to allow for social distancing and requiring masks. The school also has “every high expectation” of students, Jones said. “By agreeing to come back and be here that they have to take ownership to keep themselves safe.” Those who are participating in on-campus activities and don’t follow testing and isolation guidelines could be subject to student discipline. For a university to have a shot at reopening successfully, it needs to hold classes online or outside when possible, have a good system for testing and contact tracing, and have clear and transparent metrics for when it will change course, Salomon said. (Asked about what would trigger a move to remote instruction, Jones said “one of the key metrics, we’re keeping our eye on is the number of positive cases.”) All of these are costly  and administratively challenging undertakings. Jones said his best “guesstimate” is that the school’s testing component alone will cost $7 to $10 million per semester. But a major obstacle to any successful reopening, is just the status of the spread of the virus itself, Salomon said. “We’re still very much in the middle of a raging pandemic,” he said. “With that amount of transmission in communities and bringing together students from around the country, we know that there will be people infected upon arrival. It raises the bar on what needs to be done to interrupt transmission and cut it off.” During the first week of classes, when the school onboarded tens of thousands of students, “the main hiccup” in its system was turning test results around fast enough so that students, faculty and staff would have access to buildings they needed to be in for class, Smith said. Those who haven’t had a negative test result in the last four days can’t get into university buildings, except their own residence hall. Still, the school has been turning test results around “well within” the 48 hour window they’ve promised, she said. Workman was one of those affected by the hiccup. She got tested on a Monday, which was one of the testing days assigned to her by the school, but didn’t get her results back in time to teach her 8 a.m. Tuesday class in person. She “had to call an audible and tell my class we were meeting on Zoom.” When the two public speaking classes she was teaching started last week, roughly 5% of her students couldn’t attend because they’d tested positive for the virus, Workman said. That’s one metric Workman said she’ll be keeping an eye on as she evaluates whether to keep teaching in person. If enough students can’t attend class face-to-face because of quarantine or isolation, she’ll transition to remote instruction, though her preference is to continue teaching in-person classes — the widespread testing has made her feel comfortable doing so. Owen Stephenson was eager to come to campus for his freshman year to gain some independence, even if he would be taking most of his classes online. So far, he’s felt like the testing has gone smoothly; he received his first two test results on the same day he tested and his only quibble was a 45-minute wait on a weekend, when there are fewer testing tents available. The required testing is part of what makes Stephenson feel like he can keep himself safe, regardless of other students’ behavior. “Their testing is the only thing that sets them apart from other universities trying to go back,” he said of U of I’s plan. From her observations in class, Workman said it seems as if students are committed to making the school’s reopening program work because they want to stick around for the semester. Still, she said, the changes to the college experience required during this time — more rules for engaging on campus, more online courses than typical — have left her students so drained that she ended a recent class 20 minutes early. “They had this feeling that once they were finally able to get back on campus, that life would feel more normal and it’s not.” ‘When his mother passed away, he received an inheritance of $8,000.

    "text": "This interview is the third in a series of conversations MarketWatch is conducting with some of the leading voices in the U.S. on the COVID-19 pandemic. Back in April, Dr. Dixie Harris and about 100 nurses and doctors from the Intermountain Healthcare hospital system in Utah flew to New York City to work in the region’s overburdened hospitals. Harris, a pulmonologist who studies e-cigarette vaping, worked for days in a row, caring for COVID-19 patients when the region’s local hospitals were overwhelmed. It was at Southside Hospital in Bay Shore, N.Y., that she started to learn about the virus, about why it’s better to put patients prone, why ventilators aren’t always the best option — and the importance of wearing a face mask. “One hundred of us went,” she said. “Zero came back positive.” Back home in the much more sparsely populated state of Utah, cases peaked at 876 on July 9, according to the Utah Department of Health. About 400 people in total have died as a result of a COVID-19 infection. (New York state has reported a total of 430,774 cases and 25,297 deaths as of Aug. 25.) As cases have declined, more of Harris’ focus has turned to patients who had COVID-19 in the spring and are still dealing with myriad health problems and symptoms months later. Many of these patients in the U.S. call themselves “long haulers.” They have reported fatigue, chest pain and neurological damage. “One of my first long-hauler patients had symptoms in March,” she said. “Five months later, and this patient was never in the hospital. That’s who I’m mostly seeing: patients who haven’t been in the hospital but continue to have ongoing symptoms.” Dr. Dixie Harris: We were there three weeks in April. It was pretty intense. It was right as the peak was going down, but there were still six times the number of ICU patients or more for the hospital I was working in. From what I could see, it hit pretty much within a week. It went from next to no COVID patients to overwhelming the whole system. I’ve had other people ask me, “Why didn’t they just ship some of those patients to another hospital?” Well, every hospital in Long Island was overrun with patients. And all the ambulances were so busy bringing new patients in, it’s not like they could say, “Oh, we’ll take this one patient all the way up to Albany. “ A tsunami is what they called it because there was no warning and it hit all at once. It was an incredibly dynamic learning environment. From when we started to when I left, care changed markedly. We were intubating early on. And then we said, “Wait a second, once they go on the ventilator, they’re on for three weeks. What can we do to avoid this?” The big key is proning. Even if you get some respiratory symptoms but you don’t have to be in the hospital, go ahead and move. Prone. Don’t just lay in the bed on your back at home. I will say it’s really hard to lay on your belly when your BMI is 45. When you’re really obese, it feels like you can’t breathe. So I tell the patients to sit up, lean forward. You’re trying to get the back upright. It was an honor to get to go there. The head of Northwell Health came when we were leaving about to get on the plane and came in to thank us. They did a water cannon salute in New York at the airport. When we were in the waiting area right at the jet way, probably 30, 40 people showed up and just gave us a shout-out clap. All wearing masks, all distanced. MarketWatch: It looks like Utah’s peak was in July. How is it different caring for patients there even now? Harris: We haven’t been overwhelmed. We have not had our ICUs completely full and so because of that we’re doing cutting edge best care possible. Every COVID patient is presented to infectious disease to decide which meds they qualify for. Harris: The laypeople are calling it long haulers. The British Medical Journal just did a nice review on management of post-acute COVID patients. They’re calling it long COVID. In the medical community, we haven’t fully named it. But I’m [also] aware of patients who consider themselves long haulers who have never (been) diagnosed positive for COVID. They feel they have it because they have the symptoms, the time frame, and all that. Harris: That’s really what we are just learning. Who I get are patients who two to three months later are still having shortness of breath, still having aches and pains, and maybe chest symptoms. Many of them are still on oxygen. Now mind you, we are at higher elevation. So some of these patients would not necessarily be hypoxic if they were at sea level. Still, these are people who are used to living here, so their body is adjusted to it. Dr. Kirk Knowlton, [Intermountain’s director of cardiovascular research, critical care physician Dr. Eliotte Hirshberg] and I are going to be talking to our leadership about developing protocols to take care of these patients. Part of it is to acknowledge that patients are still having symptoms. One of my first long-hauler patients had symptoms in March. I talked to the patient a week and a half ago, and he is still having a little bit of symptoms [but is] markedly better. Back to work now. But five months later, and this patient was never in the hospital. That’s who I’m mostly seeing: patients who haven’t been in the hospital but continue to have ongoing symptoms. In the BMJ article that just was published, they’re saying that 10% of patients who test positive remain unwell after three weeks. Their definition is if you have symptoms more than three weeks, you’re going into the long haulers. A lot of people are calling long haulers a month out. My colleague and I are presenting to our leadership — he’s a cardiologist, and I’m a pulmonologist — but we’re the ones who are aware of these cases two, three, four, or five months later. The fatigue and the memory issues. Depression. There’s a lot of non-pulmonary issues. Muscle aches. Anxiety. Everybody’s anxious in the day of COVID, right? Everybody’s stressed. Everybody’s had to adjust and learn. Primary care’s going to be addressing more and more of this. And our psychiatric services are going to be seeing this. My long haulers, most of them are on oxygen, and they all have pulmonary symptoms. But every time I see them, they’re a little bit better. I do see improvement over time. I will say that things such as prolonged symptoms — fatigue, that kind of thing — has been reported in MERS and SARS. MarketWatch: It’s not just a respiratory illness. Harris: Right. It’s a blood vessel illness. It’s a brain illness. It’s a muscle illness. MarketWatch: You’ve done some research around vaping and smoking. How do you talk to patients about these types of things in the context of COVID? Harris: It’s pretty well established that vaping nicotine does weaken the immune system. It especially affects how the nose can fight viruses. And how does COVID get in the system? Eyes, nose, mouth, right? You saw more cases of EVALI (e-cigarette, or vaping, product use associated lung injury) in April and May. A lot of the EVALI, like 90% to 95%, is due to the tainted THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) oil. [THC is the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis that makes people feel “high.”] I think people are going to THC with the stress of all the quarantines and all the changes. It makes sense people are reaching for that. Whatever you do, don’t vape the THC. This Q&A has been edited for clarity and length. • Dr. Osterholm: Americans will be living with the coronavirus for decades Shares of Nio Inc.  sank 4.6% in midday trading Wednesday, as they pulled a sharp U-turn after reaching an intraday record earlier in the session. The China-based electric vehicle maker's stock was up as much as 4.6% at its intraday high of $21.05, which was above the previous intraday record of $20.97 and record closing price of $20.44, both of which were reached on Aug. 26. The pullback comes amid a selloff in other EV makers, led by industry leader Tesla Inc.'s stock , which took a 7.2% dive after the company disclosed that a large shareholder had recently sold 19.2 million Tesla shares. Tesla's stock has now dropped 11.5% since it closed at a record $498.32 on Monday. Among other EV makers, shares of Workhorse Group Inc.  fell dropped 6.8% and Nikola Corp.  shed 5.5%. The declines come as the S&P 500  rallied 0.8% toward a second-straight record high. Jaimy Lee is a health-care reporter for MarketWatch. She is based in New York.

    "text": "On Aug. 26, the Food and Drug Administration granted an Emergency Use Authorization to a new rapid antigen test for COVID-19 called the BinaxNOW test. I study public health policy to combat infectious disease epidemics. Testing is one of the most powerful tools available to fight the spread of COVID-19. The new test is inexpensive, rapid and easy to use. It will massively scale up access to testing, but hurdles remain in achieving widespread, frequent COVID-19 testing. The credit-card-sized test is an antigen test that detects a specific viral protein from SARS-CoV-2. It costs $5 and doesn’t require a lab or a machine for processing. Performing the test is simple. A health-care worker or technician would use a swab to collect a sample from less than 1 inch inside the nostril. They would then combine the sample with a few drops of chemicals inside the test card. Within 15 minutes, the test strip would show a positive or negative result. The test is also paired with an app that produces a digital code that can be scanned to show proof of a recent negative COVID-19 test. The BinaxNOW test is currently only authorized for patients who have had COVID-19 symptoms for seven days or less, which is when virus levels in the body are likely to be high. It must be prescribed by a physician and performed by a trained technicianor other health-care worker. The PCR test for COVID-19 is currently widely used and considered the gold standard, but requires patient samples to be sent to a lab and can take days to provide results. The new antigen test is designed to be a cheap and quick alternative to PCR testing for diagnostic purposes in a medical setting. It would add critical capacity to an overstretched testing system. The emergency use authorization provides preliminary authorization for doctors to prescribe the antigen test while the full FDA approval process is ongoing. The authorization could be revoked if the test is not as accurate or reliable as expected. However, the true accuracy could be lower because the performance testing group was only 102 people and the accuracy hasn’t been validated by the FDA as part of the full approval process. There will inevitably be some false negatives and false positives with the BinaxNOW test since accuracy isn’t 100%, but the FDA will monitor the data to make sure the test meets the reported accuracy. The BinaxNOW test is cheap, rapid, able to be mass-produced and easy to use outside a lab. This makes it a promising candidate for widespread screening. However, the test is currently only authorized for people with COVID-19 symptoms. This is an obstacle because an estimated 40% of all COVID-19 cases are asymptomatic and these people likely don’t know that they’re contagious. To maximize the effectiveness of any COVID-19 screening program, it is important to test people whether they have symptoms or not. Health-care providers are able to prescribe the BinaxNOW test for asymptomatic patients for off-label use, but health officials don’t yet know how accurate the test is when performed on asymptomatic people. The massive expansion of testing access made possible by the BinaxNOW test will almost surely outweigh the downsides of a small number of inaccurate results. Abbott plans to manufacture 50 million tests per month starting in October. This will quickly exceed the 76 million COVID-19 tests the U.S. has performed over the last six months. Widespread, frequent testing is effective at slowing the spread of the coronavirus. The new testing capacity made possible by the authorization of this rapid antigen test represents a major advance in bringing the pandemic under control. Zoë McLaren is an associate professor of public policy at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. This was first published by The Conversation — “Will the new 15-minute COVID-19 test solve US testing problems?“ A big NIO bear is a little less bearish.

    "text": "The stock (ticker: CPI.UK) has declined from a 2015 high of 1,294 pence to 30 pence (40 cents) after a series of government contracts disappointed and profit margins were squeezed. Shares are down almost 82% this year. The company, which manages the tax levied on drivers taking their car into a specific central London zone, and is involved with recruitment for the British army, and offers business and consulting services, is weighed down by a 1.1 billion pounds sterling ($1.45 billion) debt pile that dwarfs its £524 million market value. Forget earnings and dividends—investors are more focused on whether Capita will make it through the second half without breaching banking covenants—agreements made with banks over the terms of loans. “Capita continues to look uphill in its recovery; meeting banking covenant is set to remain tight in the short term,” wrote Robin Speakman, an analyst with broker Shore Capital, in a note. “Assessing shareholder value remains challenging, in our view; we expect Capita to survive and this should deliver material value.” There are other glimmers of hope. Capita is seeking to sell its Education Software Solutions, or ESS, unit for £500 million. The company also said in its half-year update that it won £770 million of new business. In a statement to Barron’s, CEO Jon Lewis says, “The market is clearly challenging, but we are continuing to win new business and deliver for our existing clients as we build a more focused and sustainable business for the long term.” Capita has “accelerated some strategic decisions,” including the sale of Education Software. “This prospective divestment, alongside other planned disposals, will help us to strengthen our balance sheet and deliver on our long-term aim of generating sustainable revenue growth and cash flows,” Lewis says. Brave investors could see this as a buying opportunity, with Jefferies marking Capita stock a Buy and estimating that it could rise 250%, to 105 pence. Broker Numis sees the price rising to 80 pence. The business fetches four times this year’s expected earnings and is valued at an 80% discount to its peers. Capita employs 61,000 workers, and at the full-year update in March, it posted a loss of £62.6 million for the year to Dec. 31, swinging from a £272.6 million pretax profit the year before. Revenues in 2019 were £3.6 billion. At the August half-year update, profits were worse than expected due to coronavirus. In 1984, Capita was created as part of a unit within the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy. Its first CEO, Rod Aldridge, led a management buyout in 1987. Lewis was drafted to the turn business around in 2017. The business is selling some of its crown jewels to prop up its finances, and Capita is a key partner in a number of United Kingdom government contracts. Some think that it’s too strategically important to fail. Capita provides some bespoke services that are difficult for customers to replicate themselves, but this isn’t a good time in general for support companies, as customers tighten their belts to ride out the crisis. Lewis says that Capita has made “good progress with our transformation,” and that it has managed its way through the Covid-19 crisis. Yet the business is having to adapt its revival plan to incorporate measures to withstand the pandemic. If anyone needs support services, it’s Capita. The stock may be one for the brave.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/rocket-stock-is-falling-after-the-company-reported-earnings-heres-why-51599079245?mod=home-page",
    "text": "The company reported net revenue of $5 billion, net income of $3.5 billion, and adjusted Ebitda, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, of $3.8 billion in its first earnings report as a public company after the bell Wednesday. “While I’m proud of our performance, I am even more encouraged by the significant opportunity that remains in front of us as we continue to execute on our plan of achieving 25 percent market share by 2030,” Rocket CEO Jay Farner said in a press release. “It is clear that our simple, client-focused, digital approach is continuously and fundamentally disrupting the way our industries do business.” The top-level figures reported today shouldn’t surprise investors. Rocket reported identical numbers in its preliminary results in mid-August as part of a disclosure to bondholders. The second-quarter earnings report issued today, however, is more detailed and sets guidance for the third quarter. For the second quarter of 2020, the company said it generated closed loan origination volume of $72.3 billion, a record for the company, and net rate lock volume of $92 billion, figures that are respectively 126% and 170% higher than they were in the same quarter last year. It also reported a gain-on-sale margin of 5.19%, spurred by industry-wide capacity constraints amid a high level of demand, Farner said on a conference call with investors. “Second quarter gain on sale margins were certainly elevated by historical standards,” he said. “This is exactly the kind of market environment we built our platform to perform in.” The company said it expects some those figures to grow even further quarter over quarter. Rocket expects net rate lock volume between $93 billion and $98 billion and closed loan volume between $82 billion and $85 billion in the third quarter of 2020. The company expects gain-on-sale margins between 4.05% and 4.30%, lower than this quarter, but 23% to 31% higher than the same quarter in 2019, the company said in its earnings release. “As we look to the second half of the year, we continue to see strength and durability in consumer sentiment, record low interest rates, and an improving U.S. real estate market continue to drive demand for home loans,” Farner said on the call. While Rocket expects volume to increase in the third quarter, the company’s executives reminded investors that the business typically follows the seasonal patterns of the U.S. real estate market. “While we’re happy to provide some guidance for Q3, really we typically do see that decrease in the fourth quarter,” said Rocket CFO Julie Booth. “I don’t think we’re expecting necessarily anything unusual this year, other than what we typically see, but of course that could always change.” The company also discussed potential uses for excess capital, indicating that dividends, buybacks and acquisitions could be in the future. “As a private company, we’ve historically done special dividends over the course of time,” Farner said on the call. “An acquisition is something that we think about as a use for the currency as well, and of course repurchase, if we think that that makes sense.” Rocket shares were trading down about 7.1% to $29.06 in after-hours trading Wednesday.

    "title": "Tesla’s stock sinks again to kick off a correction after disclosure of another large seller",
    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/teslas-stock-sinks-into-correction-territory-after-disclosure-of-another-large-seller-2020-09-02?mod=home-page",
    "text": "Shares of Tesla Inc. took another dive Wednesday to kick off a correction, after the electric vehicle maker disclosed that one of its largest shareholders sold off a chunk of stock, although the sale was effectively just a rebalancing as the value of the stake has actually increased. What may be unnerving investors is the disclosure comes a day after the company itself said it would sell up to $5 billion worth of its stock. Separately, although BofA Securities analyst John Murphy raised his price target to imply a near-30% gain from current levels, he stopped short of recommending investors buy the stock. Many on Wall Street label a decline of at least 10% to up to 20% from a significant peak as a correction, while a decline of 20% or more is defined as a bear market. Wednesday’s close below $448.49 makes the correction “official;” a close above Monday’s record would wipe away the correction label. Also read: Only 19% of Tesla analysts say buy the stock while investors remain ‘insatiable.’ Tesla disclosed in an SC-13G/A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that Scotland-based Baillie Gifford & Co. had reduced its stake to 39.63 million shares, or 4.25%. That would drop the 112-year-old investment firm to fourth on the list of Tesla’s largest shareholders. Baillie Gifford had previously disclosed a stake of 58.86 million shares as of June 30, or 6.32% of the shares outstanding according to FactSet. That made Baillie the second-largest shareholder, behind only Chief Executive Elon Musk’s 18.3% stake. Based on Tuesday’s stock closing price of $475.05, the approximately 19.23 million shares Baillie Gifford sold would be valued at about $9.14 billion. Baillie Gifford said it sold the stock to meet internal guidelines that limit the percentage of the portfolio that could be invested in a single stock, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal. As of June 30, Baillie’s Tesla stake was valued at about $12.7 billion. As of Tuesday’s closing price, which was 120% above the June 30 closing price of $215.96, the value of the decreased stake increased by 48% to $18.8 billion. Baillie said it remains optimistic about Tesla’s future, and would buy the stock again if its sold off, the WSJ report said. BofA’s Murphy raised his stock price target to $550, which implies a 23% gain from current levels, from $350, citing the logic of the EV maker’s bulls that a rising stock price begets a rising stock price. Meanwhile, Murphy reiterated the neutral rating he’s had on the stock since Aug. 14, which reflects his skepticism around fundamentals and opportunities for the company. Murphy said Tesla’s stock-sale announcement on Tuesday corroborated his view that Tesla will take advantage of the rally to raise “low-cost equity capital” to fund accelerated growth. “It is important to recognize that the higher the upward spiral of [Tesla’s] stock goes, the cheaper capital becomes to fund growth, which is then rewarded by investors with a higher stock price,” Murphy wrote in a note to clients. He cautioned, however, that the inverse of that logic is also true, so that the lower the stock goes, the lower the stock could go. Murphy said it is this “self-fulfilling framework” that appears to explain the extreme moves in the stock, to both the upside and downside. VirnetX Holding Corp.  received a positive court ruling Wednesday, as the  internet security software and technology company disclosed that the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas has denied Apple Inc.'s  motion for relief from a judgment in the VirnetX vs. Apple patent case. The ruling is related to the case in which VirnetX was awarded total damages of $439.7 million as Apple was found to have infringed on VirnetX's patents. In February, Apple was denied a rehearing of the case. VirnetX's stock was still inactive in premarket trading, while Apple shares gained 1.8% toward record territory. Year to date, shares of VirnetX have rallied 35.3%, Apple has run up 82.8% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average  has tacked on 0.4%.

    "title": "Renters in U.S. cannot be evicted through the end of the year due to coronavirus, CDC order states",
    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/cdc-issues-nationwide-eviction-ban-through-the-end-of-the-year-in-an-effort-to-control-coronavirus-2020-09-01?mod=home-page",
    "text": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention implemented a temporary eviction moratorium through the end of the year, protecting U.S. renters from losing their homes during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Trump administration announced Tuesday. The CDC’s moratorium will apply to all rental units nationwide until Dec. 31 and goes into effect immediately, senior administration officials said of an unpublished CDC agency order. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told a U.S. House of Representatives panel Tuesday that the moratorium would cover around 40 million renters. Renters will be eligible for the moratorium’s protection if they received an economic impact payment, or stimulus check, as provided for by the CARES Act. Therefore, single renters must earn no more than $99,000 a year, while couples filing jointly can earn up to $198,000 annually. The order, which was shared ahead of being published in the Federal Register on Sept. 4, includes a declaration for renters to sign and give their landlord. Senior Trump administration officials said the form would be made available on the CDC’s website. Renters must indicate on the declaration that they cannot afford to pay their rent in full and that if evicted they would become homeless or force to move into congregate housing. Renters also must be able to prove that they made an effort to receive government assistance and that they could not afford rent. The moratorium does not absolve renters of paying the rent. That money is still due to landlords, and senior administration officials said that renters should still attempt to make partial payments when they cannot afford to pay in full. Landlords will still be permitted to evict tenants in certain cases, such as instances in which the tenant has destroyed property or poses a threat to the health or safety of neighbors. The moratorium builds on a previous executive order from President Donald Trump that directed the Department of Health and Human Services and the CDC to determine whether halting evictions was necessary to contain the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19. “In the context of a pandemic, eviction moratoria — like quarantine, isolation, and social distancing — can be an effective public health measure utilized to prevent the spread of communicable disease,” the CDC’s unpublished order said. “President Trump is committed to helping hardworking Americans stay in their homes and combating the spread of the coronavirus,” White House deputy press secretary Brian Morgenstern said during a briefing Tuesday. Housing advocates said the move was “long overdue,” but called for more help to be provided to renters facing financial difficulties amid historically high levels of unemployment caused by the pandemic. “As we have said for five months, the very least the federal government ought to do is assure each of us that we won’t lose our homes in the middle of a global pandemic: The administration’s action would do so and will provide relief from the growing threat of eviction for millions of anxious families,” said Diane Yentel, president and CEO of the National Low Income Housing Coalition. “But while an eviction moratorium is an essential step, it is a half-measure that extends a financial cliff for renters to fall off of when the moratorium expires and back rent is owed,” Yentel added, while calling on Congress to pass another COVID-19 relief bill with at least $100 billion in emergency rental assistance. Previously, some lawmakers and activists called for a cancellation of rent during the pandemic. Trump administration officials during Tuesday’s briefing said that renters and landlords would have access to emergency funds already in place, including billions of dollars in grants from the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the $142 billion coronavirus relief fund from the Treasury Department. Administration officials could not clarify whether the CDC moratorium would prevent eviction filings from occurring. Housing and legal advocates have raised concerns that landlords filed evictions against many people nationwide who should have been protected by the CARES Act moratorium. ‘When his mother passed away, he received an inheritance of $8,000.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/blowout-pelosi-says-salon-owes-her-an-apology-for-setting-me-up-2020-09-02?mod=home-page",
    "text": "Nancy Pelosi is blaming a San Francisco salon for making her look bad. The House Speaker was widely criticized on Wednesday after security footage aired by Fox News showed her getting her hair shampooed and blown out at the eSalon on Monday, even though Bay Area salons were still closed over coronavirus concerns. Hair salons were only just allowed to reopen in a limited capacity on Tuesday — and just for outdoor hairstyling services that don’t include shampooing, at that. The video clip showed Pelosi, who has pushed for wearing face masks in public during the pandemic, walking around the salon with her own mask down around her neck. Her stylist is shown wearing a mask on her face, however. Salon owner Erica Kious told Fox News that her beauty parlor rents out chairs to independent stylists, and one of these contractors told Kious she was doing Pelosi’s hair on Monday. “I was like, are you kidding me right now? Do I let this happen? What do I do?” Kious told the news program. She said Pelosi’s unexpected appointment was “a slap in the face” that “she feels that she can just go and get her stuff done while no one else can go in, and I can’t work.” Pelosi’s spokesman Drew Hammill responded in a statement that, “This business offered for the Speaker to come in on Monday and told her they were allowed by the city to have one customer at a time in the business. The Speaker complied with the rules as presented to her by this establishment.” Now Pelosi is demanding an apology from the salon, calling the whole thing a “setup” during a press conference addressing the matter on Wednesday afternoon. “I take responsibility for trusting the word of the neighborhood salon that I’ve been to over the years many times, and when they said, ‘We’re able to accommodate people one person at a time,’ I trusted that,” she said at an event about school reopenings covered by the San Francisco Chronicle. “It was a setup, and I take responsibility for falling for a setup.” Pelosi said that her mask was pulled down in the security footage because she had just had her hair washed. “I don’t wear a mask when I’m washing my hair. Do you wear a mask when you’re washing your hair? I always wear a mask,” she said. “The Beauty Parlor owner must really dislike Crazy Nancy Pelosi. Turning her in, on tape, is a really big deal,” he continued in a second missive. And Republican National Committee spokesperson Liz Harrington emailed reporters to note that salon owners who have opened their business against local laws have been jailed. “You can’t get your hair done, eat inside at a restaurant, travel, attend a funeral, or protest without mandatory quarantining. But Democrats can,” she wrote. “This isn’t about health or science. It’s about power. Democrats want to rule your life. But don’t expect their rules to apply to them.” The #SalonGate was all that reporters wanted to ask Pelosi about during her school presser on Wednesday, much to the speaker’s chagrin. “We have to get this country moving again, and I will not let this subject take away from the fact that we have 185,000 plus people who have died from this virus,” Pelosi said.

    "title": "The coronavirus may remain in the body for a month or more — but does that mean you’re still contagious?",
    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-coronavirus-may-remain-in-the-body-for-a-month-or-more-but-does-that-mean-youre-still-contagious-2020-09-02?mod=home-page",
    "text": "Health experts are learning that recovering from the coronavirus takes time. In fact, a new study of roughly 4,500 Italian COVID-19 patients published on Wednesday evening found that it takes 30 days on average for SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes the COVID-19 infection, to leave the body after the first positive test result. It takes 36 days on average for the virus to clear the body after a person starts showing symptoms. And it can linger even longer in older patients and in those with more severe illness, according to the peer-reviewed manuscript published in the online journal BMJ Open. While it’s not clear from just this observational report whether someone is still infectious during this 30-or-so-day window, the authors recommend that patients testing positive for COVID-19 get tested again in four or more weeks after their symptoms first appear in order to minimize the risk of spreading the virus. Indeed, the long-term effects of COVID-19 are only just beginning to come to light, roughly half a year into the pandemic. Some “long hauler” coronavirus patients have continued to suffer symptoms and coronavirus-related health issues for months after their initial infections, including shortness of breath, extreme muscle weakness and fatigue, and brain fog. The CDC has warned that one in five previously healthy young adults weren’t back to their usual health 14 to 21 days after testing positive. And another study found more than half (55%) of coronavirus patients still had neurological problems three months later. What’s more, this new BMJ Open report also found that the rate of false negative test results appeared to be high early in the coronavirus patients’ recovery. The study subjects were tested 15 days after their first positive swabs, 14 days after their second swabs, and nine days after their third. Those who tested negative were tested again — and the negative results were only confirmed in 79% of those cases, suggesting a rate of one false negative out of every five negative test results. The authors fear that the high rate of false negatives, plus the evidence that the virus remains in the body for more than a month, puts COVID-19 patients at risk of “unwittingly passing on the infection” as they return to work or school believing that they are all better. But the current guidance from the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that most COVID-19 patients are indeed in the clear after isolating themselves for 10 to 13 days. And those with mild to moderate illness, whose symptoms have resolved, can then leave quarantine without even getting tested for COVID-19 again. The CDC did not immediately respond to a MarketWatch request for comment about whether it has considered extending the length of time that COVID-19 patients should isolate themselves, or whether testing guidelines should be adjusted. The WHO notes that while some research has suggested that patients whose symptoms have resolved may indeed still test positive for COVID-19 for many weeks afterward, “these patients are not likely to be infectious and therefore are unlikely to be able to transmit the virus to another person.” That’s because the amount of virus a person is carrying, or their viral load, may be too low for that person to be contagious. In fact, a recent New York Times analysis suggests that many people getting diagnosed with COVID-19 could be carrying “relatively insignificant amounts” of the virus, which means that they are probably not contagious. This is because the most widely used diagnostic COVID-19 tests are PCR tests that detect the presence of the virus’ genetic material in the body. And these sensitive diagnostics can flag not only live virus samples in the body, but also genetic fragments left over from an earlier infection. (These traces are kind of like how strands of a person’s hair or skin cells can be found in a room after the person is long gone.) That’s not to say these standard diagnostic tests should be thrown out the window for being too sensitive, however. The Food and Drug Administration told the Times that when people are first infected with COVID-19, for example, they may also carry a low viral load. And tests that are less sensitive could miss these cases. The CDC also notes that someone could test negative for COVID-19 early in their infection. Research suggests that the most contagious window for COVID-19 tends to be between one to three days before someone shows symptoms (with the highest viral loads on the day someone becomes symptomatic), up until about five days afterward, according to the World Health Organization. And this level of contagiousness appears to be one to two weeks for asymptomatic persons, and up to three weeks or more for patients with mild to moderate disease. The bottom line: This is still a new virus, and health experts are still learning about how it spreads. People may be carrying the virus in their bodies longer than researchers first suspected, but it’s unclear exactly how long they will be contagious. A new study published in JAMA Pediatrics suggests that children, including asymptomatic ones, may shed the virus for weeks. So what should people take from the latest research? They should keep practicing key social-distancing measures, monitoring for symptoms, and they should get tested if they start showing symptoms or suspect that they have been exposed. Even those who test negative — either because they haven’t been exposed to the virus, or because they have recovered from it — should continue taking steps to protect themselves and those around them. This includes: washing their hands often; avoiding close contact with people outside of their household by staying at least six feet apart; and covering their nose and mouth with a face mask around others, even if they don’t feel sick. There were 25.8 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide as of Wednesday afternoon, according to the Johns Hopkins data, and at least 857,877 people have died. More than 17 million people are confirmed to have tested positive and recovered. Follow more of MarketWatch’s coronavirus coverage here.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/trump-suggests-north-carolina-residents-vote-twice-which-is-illegal-2020-09-02?mod=home-page",
    "text": "President Donald Trump on Wednesday suggested North Carolina residents should try to vote twice — by mail and in person — in the November election, seemingly encouraging them to attempt to commit voter fraud in an effort to test the state’s mail-in voting system. Trump made the comments during an interview with WECT News of Wilmington, N.C., when a reporter asked if he’s confident in the state’s voting system, which could see 600,000 absentee votes cast this fall. “They will vote and then they are going to have to check their vote by going to the poll and voting that way because if it tabulates, then they won’t be able to do that,” Trump said. “So let them send it in, and let them go vote. And if their system is as good as they say it is, then obviously they won’t be able to vote. If it isn’t tabulated, they will be able to vote. So that’s the way it is, and that’s what they should do.” Voting twice is illegal under both North Carolina and federal law. In North Carolina, it is also illegal “to induce” someone else to fraudulently cast a ballot. Trump has been a frequent and vocal critic of mail-in voting, claiming — without evidence — that it is susceptible to fraud. Trump himself has voted by mail a number of times. WECT said the way North Carolina’s system is set up, it is “clerically impossible for a person to vote twice,” because once the mail-in ballot is received, the voter would not be allowed to cast a vote in person. When asked about Trump’s suggestion Wednesday night on CNN, U.S. Attorney General William Barr said Trump was “trying to make a point,” but declined to say whether voting twice is illegal (it unequivocally is), telling host Wolf Blitzer “I don’t know what the law in the particular state says.” Separately, federal prosecutors in North Carolina charged 19 non-citizens with voter fraud Wednesday, accusing them of illegally casting ballots in 2016. Few details were disclosed, but one defendant’s attorney told the Associated Press: “These cases are clearly timed for partisan political purposes.” U.S. Sen. Edward Markey defeated U.S. Rep. Joe Kennedy III in Tuesday’s Democratic primary, harnessing support from progressive leaders to overcome a challenge from a younger rival who is a member of America’s most famous political family.

    "text": "Asian stock markets rose Thursday after Wall Street turned in its biggest daily gain since July despite uncertainty about the global outlook. Wall Street’s benchmark S&P 500 index gained 1.5% on Wednesday after a report on hiring that some analyst said might indicate the U.S. job market recovery could be fading. Investors have been encouraged by central bank infusions of credit into struggling economies and hopes for a vaccine to end the coronavirus pandemic that has plunged the world into its deepest slump since the 1930s. Forecasters warn the stock market recovery might be running too far ahead of economic activity as the United States and some other countries reimpose anti-virus controls that hamper business. “The irony of market exuberance is rich,” said Mizuho Bank in a report. “Record highs on Wall St make a mockery of policymakers grasping for recourse to the worst downturn in decades.” U.S. stocks have gained despite lack of agreement in Congress on a new economic aid package with additional unemployment benefits to support consumer spending. A report Wednesday by payroll processor ADP, widely watched as a forerunner of government employment data due out Friday, showed the private sector added 428,000 jobs in August, less than half the 1 million expected by forecasters. Analysts said that could be a warning sign the job market is cooling after some U.S. states reimposed anti-virus controls and the expiration of supplemental unemployment benefits cut into consumer spending. “Bullish stock market sentiment seems to be nearing a tentative peak as the labor market recovery stalls,” Edward Moya of Oanda said in a report. Also Wednesday, the U.S. Federal Reserve said its August survey of businesses found enduring uncertainty over the pandemic and the harm it causes to consumer and business activity. Health care and communications stocks also helped to drive Wednesday’s rally. The Dow reclaimed its perch above 29,000 on Wednesday, while other indexes booked fresh records, as investors drew hope from progress toward tests and vaccines for COVID-19.

    "text": "The stock market gets a little scarier every day—and it’s not even falling. “We are witnessing a major melt-up,” says NatAlliance Securities’ Andrew Brenner. And melt up it did. The Dow was up 0.8% at 11:30 a.m. Wednesday and trading was quiet. It started moving higher from there, slowly at first until accelerating, and was up more than 500 points before a small pullback. There was no real explanation for the stock market’s move. Investors shrugged off poor ADP jobs data and seemed unresponsive to better industrial-production numbers. Ultimately, it just wanted to go higher. For one day at least, the market action seemed to imply that the craziness that had inhabited the Nasdaq had found its way to the rest of the market. “What we’re seeing the first two days of September is FOMO spreading beyond the Nasdaq,” says Julian Emanuel, chief equity and derivatives strategist at BTIG, referring to the fear of missing out. Warning signs abound. NatAlliance Securities’ Brenner agrees. “This has gone a lot further than I thought it would,” he says. “And it will correct more than I think it probably should.” Consider that a warning.

    "text": "“The Dow Jones Industrial Average just closed above 29,000! You are so lucky to have me as your President,” wrote Trump in an emoji-laced tweet moments after the blue-chip benchmark booked its highest close since February, finishing within 2% of its Feb. 12 all-time closing high at 29,551.42. Wednesday’s equity-market climb underscored an unparalleled run-up in stocks from out of the depths of the coronavirus crisis back in March. Trump, arguably, more than any other modern president has hitched his political success to that of the economy, or at least the stock market, which were both leveled in the wake of the deadly public health crisis that emerged due to the spread of COVID-19 across the globe. Trump views his perception as a business-friendly commander-in-chief gives him an edge over Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, who currently leads the incumbent president in most national polls. The 45th president’s Wednesday tweet on stocks claimed that “Hiden’,” as he referred to the former Vice President Biden, would “crash” the markets, reiterating a persistent claim by Trump, as the race for the White House has heated up. Trump has cast his battle against Biden as a fight for the future of the U.S. economy. Still, the success of the stock market and economy won’t likely to be enough to secure a win for Trump. Strategists at JPMorgan Chase & Co. have made the case that a win for Biden would be “neutral to slight positive” for stocks. On the heels of a huge month for stocks in August, our call of the day says investors need to get ready for at least two pullbacks this year, with history as a guide.

    "text": "U.S. equity benchmark indexes closed in record territory Wednesday, as investors drew hope from progress in the development of tests and vaccines for COVID-19. Investors largely ignored a mixed batch of economic reports, including a private-sector jobs reading that came in weaker than expected, suggesting only a slow recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. On Tuesday, the Dow rose 215.61 points to end at 28,645.66, or 0.8% higher, the S&P 500 index  added 26.34 points to close at a record 3,526.65, a gain of 0.8%, after setting an intraday record of 3,528.03; while the Nasdaq Composite Index advanced 165.21 points to a record 11,939.67 finish, a rise of 1.1%, after touching a new intraday all-time high of 11,945.72. Stock markets finished at fresh records Wednesday, with a number of possible catalysts boosting the investing mood amid the coronavirus pandemic. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin  restarted talks with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi about another fiscal stimulus plan to help out-of-work Americans, although Pelosi said the two sides still have “serious differences,” following their brief phone call Tuesday. On the health front, leading infectious disease health expert Dr. Anthony Fauci told NBC’s “Today” show that a COVID-19 pandemic cure could come by the end of 2020, if the roster of companies attempting to achieve a vaccine are able to produce outstanding preliminary results. Speaking to Kaiser Health News on Tuesday, Fauci said the board overseeing vaccine approvals could decide that “the data is so good right now that you can say it’s safe and effective.” The global tally for confirmed cases of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 climbed to near 26 million on Wednesday, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University, while the death toll rose to 858,661. Buying continued in large-capitalization technology stocks and shares tied to pandemic stay-at-home trends, but also in shares of makers of consumer goods and autos. “The unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus, not only in the U.S., but around the world, is going to provide the economy with a bridge,” said Chris Armbruster, a portfolio manager at Kayne Anderson Rudnick in Los Angeles, giving investors reason to look beyond recently depressed economic data and high unemployment, to what lies ahead. In that vein, the U.S. government also will end up running its biggest budget shortfall ever this year, at $3.311 trillion, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said Wednesday. Still, Armbruster sees many companies forced by the pandemic to adopt technologies and make improvements to their supply chains as likely to “grow and recover faster, and realize better margins.” “It’s a pretty substantial miss, but still much better than what we saw last month,” said Mike Loewengart, managing director investment strategy at E-Trade Financial, via email. ADP did, however, raise last month’s jobs figure  to 212,000 for July from  a  rise of 167,000, which was then below forecast of 1.9 million jobs. The economy has recouped fewer than half of the 20-million-plus jobs lost in the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic. Separately, U.S. factory orders rose 6.4% in July for a third straight increase, reflecting a rebound in manufacturing after the economy reopened. Economists polled by MarketWatch had forecast a 6.2% gain. The Federal Reserve’s Beige Book survey also showed the U.S. economy expanded modestly in August, but with many parts of the country experiencing slower growth during the pandemic, including as some companies make temporary layoffs permanent. In other news, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention late Tuesday implemented a temporary eviction moratorium through the end of the year, protecting millions of U.S. renters from losing their homes during the COVID-19 pandemic. “Certainly, the real estate sector continues to be one that very few investors think will emerge in good shape,” said Cameron Brandt, director of research at EPFR, in an interview with MarketWatch. However, Brandt also sees improvements in the cards for a broader base of stocks, beyond the stay-at-home winners and technology giants, as the general population becomes more comfortable with the idea that COVID-19 can be a managed risk. “People want to get on with their lives,” he said, adding that basic restocking, differed consumption and other factors that go along with reopening “will provide modest surprises to the upside.” Wall Street has another explanation for why the stock market has been on fire, which could also help investors understand some tech stocks’ red hot winning streaks lately.

The results are more of the same for the company, which has moved from strength to strength in recent months. August figures also came in ahead of recently increased analyst targets.

    "text": "Investing comes with many risks, but here’s a big new hazard to worry about in the age of free trades: Just when you need access to the markets the most, you won’t have it. This is now obviously a recurring problem that should have you concerned if you lack access to professional trading platforms that don’t have similar problems. That includes a lot of us. I’ll get to several useful workarounds below. But first, here’s what we know about what’s going on, and why this is a huge issue for investors. The trite pushback goes like this: If you’re a long-term investor, losing market access for half a day shouldn’t matter. And shame on you for being a grubby trader who can’t live without constant access! This response falls short. Long-term investors such as Warren Buffett patiently lie in wait with cash for months or years for that one moment when their favorite stocks go on sale because of fears they deem unjustified. If accounts shut down exactly when that moment arrives, you can’t follow through. Investors weren’t the only ones hurt. The Monday mishap came at an inopportune time — the end of the month. Anyone wanting to check direct deposits or cash levels at Vanguard and elsewhere to pay bills couldn’t do so. 1. If something as innocuous as a stock split shuts down brokerage platforms, we can guess that it will happen again during the next market hiccup, and especially in any major crisis caused by something like a terrorist attack or natural disaster. 2. Professional trading platforms went unaffected. “I didn’t hear anyone saying they had a problem with order management systems,” says Joe Saluzzi of Themis Trading, referring to professional platforms. “The only thing I heard about was problems on retail systems.” It was a Main Street, not a Wall Street, problem. This turned Robinhood’s trademark catch phrase — “We’re on a mission to democratize finance for all” — on its head. 3. The brokerages aren’t telling us much about what went wrong, or how they plan to fix it. I reached out to the five brokerage services listed above, but got vague responses. (See below.) Saluzzi offers a plausible explanation. Partly because commissions are now zero, the number of trades in Apple and Tesla on Monday increased 3.5 to 5 times over Friday. This included tens of thousands of one- and two-share lots. “I’ve never seen stocks trade like that,” says Saluzzi, who has worked at brokerages and trading platforms for decades. His custom app that tracks time and sales in Apple and Tesla was “spinning like a roulette wheel” all day. And it continued after-hours — also unusual. The upshot: Even if overall trading volume wasn’t high, brokerage platforms got overwhelmed by trades and market data flow, he says. This might have caused an overload in one part of their systems that shut everything down. 4. CEOs at companies that reveal pay because they are public got anywhere from $6 million last year at E*TRADE to $16 million at Schwab. Directors are pulling in $215,000 to $544,600 a year. Much of this is “performance pay.” Customers may question why they got so much for managing trading platforms that do not perform when needed. (As private companies, Vanguard and Robinhood don’t disclose pay.) Vanguard, in response, says it has “heavily reinvested in our business and technology infrastructure to continuously provide a better client experience via web, mobile or phone. We will continue to review our technology systems carefully to help prevent interruptions in the future.” Robinhood says that, since March, it has improved system capacity, and to keep up with growth its engineering team “has been working diligently to further strengthen our infrastructure, improve reliability and increase capacity. We are actively growing our engineering teams.” Schwab responds that through Monday its “client-facing systems were fully available close to 99.9% of the time for the quarter.” It says it is continuing to investigate the root cause of Monday’s failure. “We do not publicly disclose the specific steps we take to ensure security and reliability.” TD Ameritrade didn’t say anything about what caused the outage, but it did say its thinkorswim app worked all day. E*TRADE declined to comment. Outages at key moments may continue. Here are some workarounds. • Use apps. Schwab tells me its phone app worked Monday, and it successfully directed customers there for market access. Ameritrade’s Margaret Farrell says its thinkorswim desktop and mobile apps worked Monday. It makes sense to enable all your brokerage’s apps as a backup. • Have some of your money on several platforms since they might not all freeze up at once. But even platforms including Interactive Brokers that have a reputation for being robust can have issues. • Invest for the long term, and don’t trade. This reduces the impact. But not by 100%. Even long-term investors watch their favorite stocks for buyable dips, a big part of long-term investing. ­• If you trade, reduce overnight exposure. But this common trading tactic won’t help when a crisis freezes platforms during trading hours. • Invest in mutual funds. Leave the driving to the pros, so outages don’t matter. The problem is that so many mutual funds so consistently underperform, it’s not necessarily a good option. • Ask your representatives in Congress for help. They can pressure financial regulators to do something. Agencies include the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Unfortunately, we are in a multi-year “silly season” in the political world. So it might not pay to get your hopes up about help from politicians. That would be a shame. In the day-to-day market bustle, we tend to forget that the main role of the stock market is to channel savings to companies so they can invest and create jobs, new drugs and other innovations.

    "text": "Tech giant Amazon is adding 7,000 permanent jobs to its U.K. workforce by the end of 2020 in a boost to its hiring spree for the year. The e-commerce firm has already added 3,000 permanent jobs in the U.K. this year alongside thousands of temporary roles. In addition to these permanent jobs, Amazon plans to hire an additional 20,000 seasonal workers before the winter holiday rush. The additional jobs bring Amazon’s total British workforce to more than 40,000 and are centered on three new high-tech fulfillment centres that will absorb more than 1,000 new employees each. British Business Secretary Alok Sharma called the move “a clear vote of confidence in the UK economy” as the country grapples with the economic effects of the coronavirus. Amazon is among the small group of companies that have profited hugely during the coronavirus pandemic. Millions of people stuck at home have turned to online shopping for necessities and distractions alike, boosting the Seattle-based tech giant’s sales in the second quarter of 2020 by 40% compared with last year and doubling its profit in the same period. Amazon’s share price has risen over 90% since the beginning of the year, making its founder and CEO Jeff Bezos the richest person in the world.

    "text": "“If Joe Biden gets elected, everyone will dump all their stocks so they won’t have to pay the higher capital gains taxes he’ll impose on investors. Get out while you can.” “If President Donald Trump is re-elected, his reckless spending and masks-off attitude toward ending the pandemic will force states to reimpose lockdowns that will put millions more Americans out of work.” With the Democratic and Republican conventions  over with, we’re heading into the home stretch of what promises to be the most unusual election in U.S. history. No matter which side of the political aisle you’re on, you’ve probably either read or heard some of the lurid doomsday predictions made by so-called market prophets. The sad thing is, these wildly inaccurate pundits spew the same hyperbole during every presidential election year. Depending who wins the office, they say, the market will either skyrocket or plummet. Yet the market almost always ignores these politically motivated prognostications. Why? Because history shows that, over the long term, market performance isn’t affected by who wins presidential elections. Instead, investors react almost exclusively to events that affect the economy in general and corporate profits in particular. Why has the market recovered? Because institutional investors — the ones that do the majority of trading on Wall Street — are expressing their views that the current recession won’t last long and that corporations will start posting higher earnings in 2021. These investors also believe that the Federal Reserve will continue to keep interest rates at historically low levels and the government will continue to spend trillions on economic stimulus programs until unemployment rates drop to “manageable” levels. These policies are unlikely to change even if Biden is elected president and the Democrats regain the Senate. The market knows this, and, absent a need to restore nationwide lockdowns, it’s likely to continue to move cautiously upward. Do you believe that newly elected Democratic presidents cause market sell-offs or that first-term Republican presidents release the bulls on Wall Street — or vice versa? History debunks that myth. Need evidence? Take a look at how the S&P 500 has performed in the first full year of a newly elected president over the past 92 years. 1929*: -11.91% 1933: 46.59% 1953:** -6.62% 1961: 23.13% 1969:** -11.36% 1977: -11.50% 1981**: -9.73% George H.W. Bush (R) succeeds Reagan (R)) 1989: 27.25% Clinton (D) succeeds G.H.W. Bush (R) 1993: 7.06% George W. Bush (R) succeeds Clinton (D) 2001**: -13.04% Obama (D) succeeds George W. Bush (R) 2009: 23.45% 2017: 9.54% Viewed solely through an electoral lens, you might assume that the markets reacted negatively to Republicans winning the presidency more often than Democrats. But this narrow thinking ignores both political and economic facts. In most cases the negative returns were the result of an economic downturn that began after the new president had settled in office. For example, the market was flying high during most of the first year of the Hoover administration until the crash of October 1929 sparked the Great Depression. What about those who say that when Democrats raise taxes wealthy investors run for the hills? That’s not supported by evidence, either. For example, in 1990 President George Bush raised taxes on the wealthiest Americans, sparking the usual fears of a market selloff. Instead, the S&P 500 delivered positive returns in eight of the following nine years. In 2012, President Barack Obama allowed President George W. Bush’s tax cuts for Americans making more than $400,000 per year to expire. Investors didn’t panic. From 2013 to 2016 the S&P 500 delivered an average annual return of 12.45%. The fact is, presidential politics and tax policies have little impact on the markets, and the stock market still tends to post positive returns over the long term. Unless you absolutely are going to need to use your invested assets for retirement income or other purposes over the next year or so, try not let your political views lead you to impulsive investment decisions that do more harm than good. If you’re convinced that the market is headed for a free-fall, there are ways to protect the value of your investments without hitting the panic button. David Frisch, a financial advisor and president of Frisch Financial Group, has received many calls from scared investors who either want to get out of the market completely or are looking for ways to limit their losses. He tries to convince them to stick to their plans, but if they’re frantic about protecting against catastrophic losses, he discusses three possible strategies they may want to consider, even though he doesn’t explicitly endorse any of them. 1. Consider boosting cash and bond allocations: Selling a certain percentage of your stocks and investing the proceeds in cash or short-term bond funds can reduce potential losses if the stock market tanks without sacrificing potential gains if it rises. But you have to make significant changes to your asset allocation for this strategy to offer any meaningful level of protection. “For example, if the investor’s portfolio is now 55% stocks and 45% cash or short-term bonds, moving to a 50/50 mix isn’t going to change their outcome all that much,” Frisch says. “And if they’re adjusting their allocation in a taxable portfolio, the amount they may have to pay in capital gains taxes when they sell stock positions may be higher than what they might have lost if the market went down.” 2. Consider buying puts for bear market protection and potential profits:  Another possible solution is to invest some of your money in put options. These hedging securities give you the right to sell an underlying stock or index (such as the S&P 500) at a predetermined price by a certain expiration date. If the index is down when you sell the put you may make a profit. If the index is higher than your put price when you sell it, your options will expire worthless but your equities may rise. “While a put won’t benefit investors when the market is rising, it’s a viable strategy for those who strongly believe that the market will fall over a defined time frame. Investing in a put can both protect the portfolio’s downside while offering the potential to make a profit should the investor’s bearish market sentiments come to fruition,” Frisch says. 3. Consider defined outcome ETFs to gain greater control over upside and downside risk: In the past few years, a new class of exchange-traded funds have emerged that are designed to help investors reduce potential losses over a predefined period. Defined outcome ETFs invest in options contracts that attempt to mirror the performance of a stock market index over a one-year period. Each ETF has a stated “buffer,” a percentage of losses an investor will be protected from if the ETF loses value, as well as a “cap,” which is the maximum return the investor will earn if the ETF’s price rises. Here’s a hypothetical example. The XYZ S&P 500 Defined Outcome ETF-September 2021 offers a 9% buffer and a 16% cap. If you buy shares at its opening price on September 1, 2020, the first day of its term, and the fund’s value is down 20% on August 31, 2021, the last day of its outcome period, your actual loss will be 11% (20%-9%). Likewise, if the ETF is up 20% on August 31, 2021, you’ll miss out on 4% of that gain. While on paper these defined outcome ETFs appear to offer investors the ability to restrict how much they can gain or lose to a particular range, in practice this isn’t necessarily so, Frisch says. “Your actual outcome will really depend on the price of the ETF when you buy it and its price either at the end of the term or if you sell it beforehand. Considering that these funds typically charge management fees of 0.80%, compared to around 0.05%-0.10% for most ETFs, they’re more expensive, but these costs may be worth paying for the protection they provide.” All that said, Frisch discourages investors from rushing into any of these protective options. “I’ll try to remind them that the S&P 500 has finished in negative territory in only 26 out of the past 90 years, and nine of those years occurred during the Great Depression,” he says. He also strongly advises investors not to try to implement any of these options on their own. Says Frisch: “Reallocating your portfolio, evaluating and buying put options and researching the many flavors of defined outcome funds requires a level of investment knowledge most people simply don’t have.” Pam Krueger is the creator and host of the MoneyTrack investor-education television series seen nationally on PBS.

    "text": "If you are an investor of any type — whether you have a 401(k), IRA, or trading account — there are a few things you could do to promote racial equity. You may have heard of ESG investing, which stands for “environmental, social and governance.” It is also often called sustainable, socially responsible or simply “values” investing. It’s an investment strategy that selects stocks and bonds based not only on traditional financial criteria, but also based on the impact of different companies on society and the environment. Proponents of ESG investing point to a growing body of evidence that suggests sustainable investing may actually improve a portfolio’s performance, while also serving the greater good. Over the past five years, sustainable funds have outperformed their conventional peers in both up and down markets, according to a Morningstar report. Also, as markets tumbled during the first quarter of 2020, almost 60% of the biggest U.S. sustainable mutual funds and exchange-traded funds lost less in market value than the S&P 500. The popularity of socially responsible investing has exploded in recent years. In early 2020, around 74% of global investors said they plan to increase their ESG allocation over the next year. In the first quarter of 2020, U.S., sustainable funds saw inflows of $10.5 billion, according to Morningstar — a more than 10-fold increase from the first quarter of 2010. And even as markets tumbled due to the coronavirus crisis, global demand for ESG proved resilient. The global sustainable-fund universe saw inflows of over $45 billion in the first quarter, while the overall fund universe saw outflows of more than $380 billion, according to Morningstar. Environmental factors often include things like carbon emissions and water usage. Social impact may involve working conditions for a company’s employees and gender or racial equity. And governance criteria often have to do with board oversight and transparency. In light of recent events, the “S” — or social — part of ESG has come into focus, as more and more people are looking at the social impact of large corporations, specifically from a racial justice standpoint. That’s where things get a little tricky. There are more than 300 funds marketed as ESG in the U.S., according to Morningstar. But there’s no official definition of “socially responsible” investing. To further complicate the issue, there are dozens of different companies that issue ESG ratings, ranging from large data providers, like MSCI and Sustainalytics, to smaller companies and even nonprofits that focus on topics like gender-pay equity and civil liberties. Unlike accounting standards, there is not one unique methodology. Some of the data is self-reported by the companies, and some of it is done by third parties, who are often estimating. There are of course some broad principles, like how the company treats its workers — but these are often hard to quantify. For example, companies can get a high score for having anti-harassment policies in place, without tracking how well the policies are actually implemented. “There are not yet clear apple-to-apple comparisons across the board even for public companies, let alone private companies,” said Andrei Cherny, CEO of Aspiration, an online “financial firm with a conscience,” which offers a variety of banking and investing products focused on environmental and social impact. Cherny has called for regulators to require public companies to report ESG-related data, such as carbon emissions, diversity of their workforce, and how they pay their employees — just like they have legal obligations to report their financial performance. “Those are factors that investors need to know just as much as they need to know the price-to-earnings ratio,” he said. Other industry leaders echo Cherny’s thoughts. For instance, in the wake of recent events, Calvert Research & Management, a prominent sustainable-investing shop, called for companies to “accurately assess their racial diversity” and make it public, provide pay equity disclosure across race and gender, and publicly state what they are doing to combat racism and police brutality. Meanwhile, some asset managers have decided to influence change from the inside. Neuberger Berman, which manages $330 billion, decided to use its shareholder status to drive governance and sustainability practices. In April 2020, the company announced that it would publicly disclose and explain the firm’s voting rationale and intentions at more than 25 key annual shareholder meetings. “Normally shareholders vote quietly behind the scenes,” said Jonathan Bailey, Head of ESG at Neuberger Berman. Instead, by providing advance vote disclosure, Neuberger Berman intends to educate investors and the public on “why we’re voting a particular way,” Bailey said. “We have a responsibility, as market participants, to take [these issues] seriously; they’re financially material issues,” Bailey said. The proposal did not end up passing, as it gathered about 30% shareholder support, according to a Neuberger Berman spokesperson. While there are currently no industry-wide standards around social impact, a few companies have launched niche products specifically targeted at race and equality. For example, OpenInvest, a company that builds indexes and other investing tools around social causes, has created an index specifically on racial justice. It screens for metrics like board member inclusion, workforce diversity and which companies pollute the most in communities of color. Similarly, Impact Shares, a nonprofit provider of exchange-traded funds, partnered with the NAACP to launch a first-of-its-kind racial empowerment ETF. But what the ESG industry has been missing is that “your social priorities may be drastically different from my social priorities,” said Ethan Powell, CEO of Impact Shares. For example, some ESG funds hold shares of liquor or gaming companies. These holdings might be a problem for some investors, but not others. Powell envisions a future where “effectively every social issue will be reflected with a separately investible fund,” so that investors can create portfolios that are reflective of their individual social priorities. Partnering with nonprofits could play a key role in the development of such products, according to Powell, because social-advocacy organizations are in a better position to understand the particular social issues at hand. What many experts agree on is that growing investor demand will inevitably push the industry to innovate. Years ago socially-responsible investing offered just a few options to cover a small piece of investors’ stock portfolios. Today, there are hundreds of different mutual and exchange-traded funds to pick from, not just in equities but also in fixed income and even junk bonds. One study showed that around $12 trillion of assets in the U.S. are managed under some sustainable investing strategy. So while you wait for the industry to establish widely-accepted standards, you could start building your own socially-responsible portfolio by looking at the ratings and methodology of different funds and companies and picking what aligns best with your values and financial goals. The 2020 election race between incumbent President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden is a coin toss,  LPL financial chief market strategist Ryan Detrick says.

    "text": "Eurozone service activity barely expanded in August, according to data released on Thursday, a sign of the halting recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. The IHS Markit eurozone services purchasing managers index registered 50.5 in August versus 54.7 in July. That is slightly above the flash reading of 50.1, and over the 50 mark indicating improving conditions. A marked slowdown of growth in France, plus returns to contraction in Italy and Spain, weighed heavily on overall service sector expansion, IHS Markit said. “The near-stalling needs to be viewed in the context of the strong expansion seen in July: business growth had surged to a near two-year high as economies opened up further from the severe COVID-19 lockdowns. However, the latest reading still sends a disappointing signal that the rebound has lost almost all momentum,” said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit. It was a different story in the U.K., which had the worst showing of the major economies in the June-ending quarter. The IHS Markit/CIPS UK Services PMI rose to 58.8 in August, up from 56.5 in July. The timeline raised concern among public health experts about an “October surprise” — a vaccine approval driven by political considerations ahead of a presidential election, rather than science.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/trump-orders-federal-agencies-to-review-defunding-new-york-3-other-lawless-cities-2020-09-02?mod=home-page",
    "text": "WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump is ordering the federal government to begin the process of defunding New York City and three other cities where officials allowed “lawless” protests and cut police budgets amid rising violent crime, The Post can exclusively reveal. Trump on Wednesday signed a five-page memo ordering all federal agencies to send reports to the White House Office of Management and Budget that detail funds that can be redirected. New York City, Washington D.C., Seattle and Portland are initial targets as Trump makes “law and order” a centerpiece of his reelection campaign after months of unrest and violence following the May killing of George Floyd by Minnesota police. “My Administration will not allow Federal tax dollars to fund cities that allow themselves to deteriorate into lawless zones,” Trump says in the memo, which twice mentions New York Mayor Bill de Blasio by name. “To ensure that Federal funds are neither unduly wasted nor spent in a manner that directly violates our Government’s promise to protect life, liberty, and property, it is imperative that the Federal Government review the use of Federal funds by jurisdictions that permit anarchy, violence, and destruction in America’s cities.” Federal agencies must detail “all Federal funds provided to Seattle, Portland, New York City, Washington, D.C.” Also, within 14 days Attorney General Bill Barr must develop a list of “anarchist jurisdictions” that “permitted violence and the destruction of property to persist and have refused to undertake reasonable measures” to restore order. The memo does not require Barr to include the four cities, possibly for legal reasons. The memo instructs White House budget director Russ Vought to issue guidance in 30 days from Wednesday “to the heads of agencies on restricting eligibility of or otherwise disfavoring, to the maximum extent permitted by law, anarchist jurisdictions in the receipt of Federal grants.” The amounts of money impacted by Trump’s order could be massive. New York City, for example, gets about $7 billion a year in federal aid. New York is named because of a crime wave as officials cut police funds. The city had a 177 percent spike in shootings in July compared to last year. The City Council approved a budget in July that cuts $1 billion from the NYPD’s $6 billion annual budget and eliminates $537 million in capital spending. The memo says that “in New York City, city officials have allowed violence to spike.” “In light of this unconscionable rise in violence, I have offered to provide Federal law enforcement assistance, but both Mayor de Blasio and Governor Andrew Cuomo have rejected my offer,” Trump says in the memo. “While violence has surged, arrests have plummeted. In a 28-day period during the months of June and July, [New York City] arrests were down 62 percent from the same period in 2019. Amidst the rising violence, Mayor Bill de Blasio and the New York City Council agreed to cut one billion dollars from the New York Police Department (NYPD) budget, including by cancelling the hiring of 1,163 officers.” The memo also cites NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea’s June disbandment of plainclothes units. “Police officials have cited this decision as a factor contributing to the rise in violence,” the memo says. The document knocks the performance of Democratic mayors in each city, as well as state leaders. “As a result of these State and local government policies, persistent and outrageous acts of violence and destruction have continued unabated in many of America’s cities, such as Portland, Seattle, and New York,” the memo says. In Washington, DC, “Mayor Muriel Bowser allowed rioters and anarchists to engage in violence and destruction in late May and early June, requiring me to call in the National Guard to maintain law and order in the Nation’s Capital,” the memo says. The memo, in the works for weeks, does not directly reference activists confronting guests of Trump’s Republican National Convention speech as they left the White House on Thursday. Portland made the list for nightly clashes that this week included activists smashing the windows of Mayor Ted Wheeler’s condo building, launching fireworks at its windows and lighting fires both inside and outside the residence. Wheeler, who refused Trump’s offer of federal assistance in a recent letter, announced Tuesday he will find a new home to spare his neighbors from further protests. Seattle is on the list largely for tolerating a long-running “autonomous zone” that ultimately was dismantled due to violent crime including shootings nearby. “On July 1, Seattle declared the protest zone dismantled. But such failed leadership continues to harm the people of Seattle as, in recent weeks, rioters have engaged in violence and destruction of property across Seattle, resulting in at least 59 police officers being injured and multiple businesses and vehicles vandalized,” the memo says. Vought, the White House budget director, applauded the review in a statement. “American taxpayers who fund the great programs that our cities rely on deserve to be protected by their local city officials,” Vought told The Post. “We are taking action by exploring all options to ensure federal resources flowing to lawless cities aren’t being squandered. The lack of law and order surrounding these riots, and response from local leadership, is a dereliction of duty. Our men and women in blue cannot be handcuffed by local leadership in their efforts to respond to riots and protect their fellow citizens,” Vought said. A senior administration official told The Post that “taxpayers shouldn’t foot the bill for local politicians’ dereliction of duty” and “President Trump is ensuring taxpayer dollars are not wasted by lawless mayors.” The list of cities and possibly states will be updated periodically with input from the Justice Department, the official said, and federal agencies will be directed to revise grant conditions when applicable to uphold the rule of law. The official said Portland, the smallest city on the list, got more than $252 million in federal funds in fiscal 2019, including for police operations. This report originally appeared on NYPost.com. U.S. Sen. Edward Markey defeated U.S. Rep. Joe Kennedy III in Tuesday’s Democratic primary, harnessing support from progressive leaders to overcome a challenge from a younger rival who is a member of America’s most famous political family.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/blowout-pelosi-says-salon-owes-her-an-apology-for-setting-me-up-2020-09-02?mod=home-page",
    "text": "Nancy Pelosi is blaming a San Francisco salon for making her look bad. The House Speaker was widely criticized on Wednesday after security footage aired by Fox News showed her getting her hair shampooed and blown out at the eSalon on Monday, even though Bay Area salons were still closed over coronavirus concerns. Hair salons were only just allowed to reopen in a limited capacity on Tuesday — and just for outdoor hairstyling services that don’t include shampooing, at that. The video clip showed Pelosi, who has pushed for wearing face masks in public during the pandemic, walking around the salon with her own mask down around her neck. Her stylist is shown wearing a mask on her face, however. Salon owner Erica Kious told Fox News that her beauty parlor rents out chairs to independent stylists, and one of these contractors told Kious she was doing Pelosi’s hair on Monday. “I was like, are you kidding me right now? Do I let this happen? What do I do?” Kious told the news program. She said Pelosi’s unexpected appointment was “a slap in the face” that “she feels that she can just go and get her stuff done while no one else can go in, and I can’t work.” Pelosi’s spokesman Drew Hammill responded in a statement that, “This business offered for the Speaker to come in on Monday and told her they were allowed by the city to have one customer at a time in the business. The Speaker complied with the rules as presented to her by this establishment.” Now Pelosi is demanding an apology from the salon, calling the whole thing a “setup” during a press conference addressing the matter on Wednesday afternoon. “I take responsibility for trusting the word of the neighborhood salon that I’ve been to over the years many times, and when they said, ‘We’re able to accommodate people one person at a time,’ I trusted that,” she said at an event about school reopenings covered by the San Francisco Chronicle. “It was a setup, and I take responsibility for falling for a setup.” Pelosi said that her mask was pulled down in the security footage because she had just had her hair washed. “I don’t wear a mask when I’m washing my hair. Do you wear a mask when you’re washing your hair? I always wear a mask,” she said. “The Beauty Parlor owner must really dislike Crazy Nancy Pelosi. Turning her in, on tape, is a really big deal,” he continued in a second missive. And Republican National Committee spokesperson Liz Harrington emailed reporters to note that salon owners who have opened their business against local laws have been jailed. “You can’t get your hair done, eat inside at a restaurant, travel, attend a funeral, or protest without mandatory quarantining. But Democrats can,” she wrote. “This isn’t about health or science. It’s about power. Democrats want to rule your life. But don’t expect their rules to apply to them.” The #SalonGate was all that reporters wanted to ask Pelosi about during her school presser on Wednesday, much to the speaker’s chagrin. “We have to get this country moving again, and I will not let this subject take away from the fact that we have 185,000 plus people who have died from this virus,” Pelosi said. The timeline raised concern among public health experts about an “October surprise” — a vaccine approval driven by political considerations ahead of a presidential election, rather than science.

    "text": "President Donald Trump on Wednesday made another visit to North Carolina, as the latest polling in that swing state shows him regaining a slight edge over Democratic challenger Joe Biden in the wake of last month’s party conventions. Trump delivered a speech in Wilmington, N.C., about its designation as the first American World War II Heritage City. The port city is known in part for being home to a major shipyard during World War II, as well as for currently being home to the Battleship North Carolina, which served as a backdrop during the president’s remarks. “With this designation, we proudly declare that in America, we don’t tear down the past. We celebrate our heroes. We cherish our heritage,” Trump said, in a reference to  how statues around the world are being removed amid a re-examination of racial injustices. The president praised World War II veterans who attended his speech, such as  97-year-old Medal of Honor recipient Hershel “Woody” Williams. “He’s 100% sharp. I know a 78-year-old that’s not so sharp, but he’s 97 and he’s 100%,” Trump said, in a reference to Biden, who is 77 and will turn 78 in November. Both Trump, who is 74, and Biden have been criticized as being too old to serve as president. Ahead of Trump’s trip on Wednesday, the Biden campaign issued a statement from the former vice president criticizing the Republican incumbent. “President Trump likes to call himself a wartime president, but the reality is that North Carolinians are still suffering because he surrendered to COVID-19 long ago,” Biden said in the statement. “Instead of providing North Carolina the roadmap and resources needed to protect small businesses, schools, and families, he has criticized local leaders and threatened educators for listening to public health experts.” Biden also gave a speech Wednesday in which he attacked Trump’s push for schools to reopen quickly amid the coronavirus pandemic. Trump’s Wednesday trip follows his in-person appearance at a Republican National Convention event in Charlotte last week, when he said he “felt an obligation” to be in North Carolina, a state “that’s been very good to me.” He also criticized Biden for not going in person to his convention in Wisconsin, another battleground state. Trump is slated to campaign on Thursday in Pennsylvania, a swing state that Biden visited on Monday. Related: Trump lays blames with Democrats as he surveys ‘destruction’ in Kenosha, Wis. And see:  Biden plans Kenosha, Wis., visit on Thursday In a RealClearPolitics moving average of North Carolina polls as of Wednesday, Trump is leading Biden by 1 percentage point, after being down by 5 points a month ago. In swing states overall ahead of the Nov. 3 election, Biden still has a 2.5-point advantage over Trump, but that’s down from a 6-point edge a month ago, according to a RCP average.

    "text": "A new study published in JAMA Pediatrics suggests that children can spread SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, even if they never develop symptoms or even long after symptoms have cleared. It found a significant variation in how long children continued to “shed” the virus  through their respiratory tract and, therefore, could potentially remain infectious. While the virus was detectable for an average of about 2.5 weeks in the entire group, a significant portion of the children —about a fifth of the asymptomatic patients and about half of the symptomatic ones — were still shedding virus at three weeks, meaning they were releasing it into the environment. The researchers also found that the duration of COVID-19 symptoms also varied widely, from three days to nearly three weeks. A recent systematic review estimated that 16% of children with a SARS-CoV-2 infection are asymptomatic, but evidence suggests that as many as 45% of pediatric infections are asymptomatic, according to the U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The signs and symptoms of COVID-19 in children are similar to other infections and noninfectious processes, including influenza, according to the CDC. While children infected with SARS-CoV-2 are less likely than adults to develop severe illness or complications, they are still at risk of becoming ill. “Recent COVID-19 hospitalization surveillance data shows that the rate of hospitalization among children is low (8 per 100,000 population) compared with that in adults (164.5 per 100,000 population),” the CDC said. Such research comes at an important time for families and communities. Under pressure from the teachers union to delay the start of the school year, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Tuesday that in-person classes will be pushed back until Sept. 21, 11 days later than planned. Remote learning, also originally slated to start on Sept. 10, will now commence on Sept. 16. Other countries have not fared so well with school reopenings. Israel, which also reopened schools this week, had less success when it reopened schools on May 17 amid high temperatures that made it difficult for students to wear masks, full classrooms that made social distancing near-impossible and, perhaps, the illusion that the virus had been vanquished, creating a false sense of security. The risk, as Israel discovered, is providing an environment where children unwittingly spread the virus to each other, which can lead to community transmission. That’s particularly worrying for those who have underlying conditions, and the elderly, who are more vulnerable to the most severe effects of the virus. Community transmission also makes contact tracing more difficult. A school outbreak can lead to community spread, hence the need for staggered school reopenings, social distancing and reduced class sizes. “If we find a certain number of symptomatic people testing positive, we expect the same number of asymptomatic carriers that are much more difficult to identify and isolate,” said Enrico Lavezzo, a professor in the University of Padua’s department of molecular medicine, who coauthored a study released in June of a quarantined town in Italy. The latest study in the peer-reviewed JAMA Pediatrics focused on 91 pediatric patients at 22 hospitals in South Korea. “Unlike in the American health system, those who test positive for COVID-19 in South Korea stay at the hospital until they clear their infections even if they aren’t symptomatic,” said Roberta DeBiasi, chief of the Division of Infectious Disease at the Children’s Hospital in Washington, D.C. The patients were identified for testing through contact tracing or after developing symptoms. About 22% never developed symptoms, 20% were initially asymptomatic but developed symptoms later, and 58% were symptomatic at their initial test. The hospital staff tested them every three days on average, providing a picture of how long viral shedding continues over many weeks. Among the important findings from the study: Children, a group widely thought to develop mostly mild disease that quickly passes, can shed virus for weeks, DeBiasi and Meghan Delaney, chief of the Division of Pathology and Lab Medicine at the Children’s National Hospital in Washington, D.C., wrote in a commentary piece to accompany the study in JAMA Pediatrics. Other key points: Even asymptomatic children continued to shed coronavirus after testing positive, making them potential key vectors. In this study at least, there were a large number of asymptomatic patients: About one-fifth of the group in South Korean hospitals. Researchers said the study provides important insight on the role children might play in the spread of COVID-19. But the study also had obvious limitations. One of these relates to the link between testing and transmission. A “positive” or “negative” result may not necessarily mean that a child is infectious, “with some positives reflecting bits of genetic material that may not be able to make someone sick,” or, on the other hand, “negatives reflecting low levels of virus that may still be infectious.” Researchers may have tested different parts of the respiratory tract and different testers may yield different results. It’s unclear whether symptomatic children shed different quantities of virus than symptomatic patients. They tested for the active virus  — not antibodies —  excluding those who may have had and cleared an asymptomatic or mild infection, an important factor for understanding herd immunity. However, DeBiasi said studies such as these can add to the knowledge of public-health efforts being developed and refined to bring COVID-19 under control. “Each of these pieces of information that we, our collaborators and other scientists around the world are working to gather is critical for developing policies that will slow the rate of viral transmission in our community,” she said. As of Thursday, COVID-19 had infected 26,048,163 people worldwide, which mostly does not account for asymptomatic cases, and killed 863,445. The U.S. still has the world’s highest number of COVID-19 cases (6,114,769), followed by Brazil (3,997,865), India (3,853,406) and Russia (1,006,923), according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University. In the meantime, cases keep rising in the U.S. with California becoming the first state in the country to surpass 700,000 confirmed cases; infections hit 721,281 there as of Thursday with 13,317 COVID-related deaths. New York has recorded 436,218 infections and the highest number of deaths in the U.S. (32,972). COVID has killed 185,747 people in the U.S. AstraZeneca AZN, -1.10% , in combination with Oxford University; BioNTech SE BNTX, -5.61% and partner Pfizer PFE, -2.40% ; GlaxoSmithKline GSK, -1.61% ; Johnson & Johnson JNJ, -1.23% ; Merck & Co. MERK, -0.31% ; Moderna MRNA, -2.41% ; and Sanofi SAN, -1.34% are among those currently working toward COVID-19 vaccines.

    "title": "It seemed safe to reopen Israel’s schools, but then came COVID-19 outbreaks — what can we all learn from those mistakes?",
    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/former-israeli-coronavirus-task-force-chairman-it-seemed-safe-to-reopen-schools-but-then-came-the-outbreaks-2020-09-01?mod=home-page",
    "text": "After Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu implemented a strict lockdown in Israel in February, by early May, roughly a dozen daily new cases of coronavirus down from more than 750 per day were being reported among the country’s population of roughly 9 million people. By last month, Israel had hit 2,300 new cases in one day. But three months ago, the cost of reopening schools with so few cases of coronavirus did not seem to come close to the benefits that were believed to be gained from holding in-person classes — or so the Israeli government thought. However, a heat wave that made it difficult for students to wear masks, full classrooms that made social distancing near-impossible and, perhaps, the illusion that the virus had been vanquished all contributed to a false sense of security. Within days of reopening schools on May 17, one of the largest coronavirus outbreaks in the country occurred, prompting many schools to revert to online instruction. The hardest-hit school was Gymnasia Rehavia, a middle school and high school in the county’s capital, Jerusalem, where some 153 students and 25 staff members tested positive for coronavirus. As Rebecca Nussbaum, a teacher, told The World radio program of the first attempt to reopen schools in Israel: “We did not feel like we had any adequate time to prepare for that, in order to make sure the school was appropriately equipped for that many students coming back in one go.” “To everybody’s surprise in the school, the Thursday night before we were going back on the Sunday, we were in a staff meeting about how capsules would work; it was 9 o’clock at night and a news report came out saying that schools were opening as normal,” she added. Now the country has become a cautionary tale for what NOT to do when reopening schools. To date, Israel has reported 118,538 cases of coronavirus and 957. That translates to 10.8 deaths per 100,000 of the population or a 0.8% fatality rate. To put that in comparison, the U.S. has reported 56.4 deaths per 100,000 people and a fatality rate of 3%. The Israeli government now has a staggered system of return under its “Safe Learning” program. The country’s education ministry said approximately 2.4 million children and 205,000 education workers have resumed their school year. There will be smaller capsules for older students, and a mixture of online and in-person classes. MarketWatch spoke with Eli Waxman, a professor at the Weizmann Institute of Science and former chairman of the team advising Israel’s National Security Council on the pandemic, to understand what went wrong and what the U.S. and other countries can learn. Waxman left his position at the NSC in May after the recommendations his team made were ignored by the Israeli government, the Times of Israel reported. Eli Waxman: The contact tracing infrastructure was not built. Due to hurdles and objections within the health ministry, and due to the lack of the decision by the political level. And so we reopened physically without having this infrastructure, so there was no way to control new outbreaks. We proposed the gradual relief of social distancing measures starting with activities that are less dangerous such as construction and only later opening commerce and schools very gradually. Due to the political pressures, this program was not implemented, far from it, and all the restrictions were relieved, almost at the same time, and without proper regulations prepared for conduct in public places. So the combination of these factors led to the new uncontrolled outbreak that we’ve seen in June and July. EW: There was no plan. The health ministry was totally unprepared and, in parallel, they also removed restrictions. The original plan was to first resume activity at the lower grades up to third-grade and with reduced numbers of students per class, with masks and alcogels [disinfectants] and, after monitoring the situation for a couple of weeks, considering the resumption of activity for higher grades. We started with the lower grades and, in three days, all the grades were back to school and all the restrictions were removed. It was no surprise that we had these outbreaks. There were no capabilities to trace contacts and to isolate them and there was no way to stop the spread. EW: There are several steps that have been taken. One major development was the realization by the government and by the health ministry that an efficient and strong contact-tracing capability should be used. It was also accepted that the health ministry is not capable of doing this, and the responsibility for the construction [of this system] was moved to the army. This is something that we were recommending for months and it didn’t happen. This has happened now, and the army is building this capability. It is not set yet it is not ready but it will be ready I hope within a couple of weeks. There still debates about how school activity would resume. Some argue that the plan should be gradual, as I just described. Starting with lower grades and reducing the number of students per class, and walking in capsules, and requiring safety measures like masks and alcogels. I hope this will be implemented but it’s not at all clear to me because there are pressures to resume all activity of all grades at the same time. I’m worried that if this happens due to the pressures then we will face again serious danger of uncontrollable outbreaks. MW: A lot of countries are looking at Israel now as an example of what NOT to do. But is there anything your country has done well that you feel is not getting enough recognition? EW: The response to the first outbreak. The sooner you act, the faster you suppress the outbreak and the faster you can resume activity. The decision to close down flights and also to close school activity, and then to apply more restrictions on general activity — I think this was done in the right way early on. It allowed us to get very low numbers in April ‘and May. However, the steps that should have been taken during the time between early March and mid-May — the construction of the contact-tracing capability and setting up rules for a gradual resumption of activity — did not happen. These steps are crucial for safe resumption of activity in the presence of the virus. EW: I’m not confident because of the pressures for reopening not gradually and without precaution measures. So it really depends on how it will be done this time. If we repeat the same thing that we did last time we are going to face serious problems. I hope that we will not do it again.

    "title": "The year’s best small luxury SUVs",
    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-years-best-small-luxury-suvs-2020-09-03?mod=home-page",
    "text": "A small luxury SUV not only has the practical benefits of a compact, versatile, agile crossover, but it can be a good — and sometimes surprisingly affordable — first step into the luxury brand of your dreams. Here are the best small luxury SUVs for 2020, ranked. Score: 4.7 / 5 We’ll admit that the 2020 Audi Q5 isn’t the most budget-friendly small luxury SUV, but it’s so good that the price tag is justified. The engine options are stellar, the ride is engaging and, as usual for Audi, the interior might be the nicest in its class, and there’s plenty of room for passengers. We also like the bold yet subtle styling of this Audi, giving it a presence that can’t be ignored. Some of the technology options like the Virtual Cockpit digital gauge cluster are cutting-edge but can get pricey. Score: 4.6 / 5 Score: 4.6 / 5 The 2020 Mercedes-Benz GLC-Class is another small luxury crossover with lofty but justified pricing. This crossover gets tweaked styling inside and out keeping it fresh, plus it gets more standard and available features. The interior is as plush and comfortable as you would expect from Mercedes-Benz, and the engine options are lively, especially when you get into the high-performance AMG models. There’s a sporty “coupe” variant available, but it sacrifices some rear-seat headroom for the extra style. Score: 4.4 / 5 The X3 has long been one of our favorite compact luxury crossovers. It’s cliché to say it, but the 2020 BMW X3 truly is the BMW of small SUVs. It hits the nail on the head when it comes to bringing the soul of a sports car to the body of a crossover. It gives you SUV versatility without sacrificing much in terms of a delightful driving character. There’s a powerful range of engines available and plenty of interior space, but pricing is a little steep and you can easily get nickel-and-dimed when you start adding options. Score: 4.4 / 5 The 2020 Infiniti QX50 is an interesting and often-overlooked choice in small premium SUVs. It draws you in with its fetching styling and its attractive pricing, and the variable compression VC-Turbo engine under the hood does an excellent job blending V6-like performance with the fuel economy of a 4-cylinder. It’s pretty generous with standard infotainment and driver-assist technologies, but adding more options on top of that can start to get pricey. Once you get into the higher trims, you’re in the pricing territory of more luxurious competitors. Score: 4.4 / 5 If you’ve always wanted a Lexus and like the idea of a practical compact crossover, then the 2020 Lexus NX is the SUV for you. It delivers the safety, reliability and bold styling that Lexus is famous for, all at a reasonable price. The ride is smooth and comfortable, but if you’re looking for fun-to-drive performance, you may want to look to its European competitors. The fuel economy of the NX is respectable, and it gets much better if you opt for the frugal hybrid option, which doesn’t have much of a price premium over the standard model. Score: 4.3 / 5 The 2020 Cadillac XT4 is one of the most affordably priced luxury crossovers on this list, and it presents a great value if you’re looking to get into the Cadillac brand. The XT4 combines sharp styling with practicality in the form of a roomy interior with generous rear-seat legroom. A few downsides include an awkward infotainment system and a little more road noise inside than we’d like. We wish there was a higher-performance V model available, but the sole engine option in this Cadillac is smooth, refined and pretty good on gas. Score: 4.3 / 5 The 2020 Volvo XC60 still feels fresh from its 2018 redesign, and it offers something a little different in this crowded segment. It has a stylish and unconventional look inside and out with a posh interior and unbelievably comfortable seats with some of the highest-quality leather you’ll find in any car. Standard safety features are abundant, as you might expect from a Volvo. The high-performance (and high-price) plug-in hybrid Polestar model is a riot to drive, but the lower-end trims don’t offer very engaging driving dynamics. Score: 4.2 / 5 If you’re looking for a small SUV that is guaranteed to turn heads, the 2020 Land Rover Range Rover Evoque is a standout. It’s also a more capable off-roader than you might expect, and it lives up to its Range Rover pedigree when the pavement ends. The engine choices are both powerful and efficient, and you won’t likely get bored behind the wheel. We love the sharp exterior, but that narrow side glass makes for a bit of a claustrophobic cabin. Like many Land Rover models, its lofty price tag makes it a questionable value compared with class rivals. Score: 4.2 / 5 The 2020 Lincoln Corsair is an all-new compact SUV for the American luxury brand, and we’re impressed. It’s stylish, quiet and comfortable, which is par for the course for the resurgent Lincoln brand. The interior is a serene sanctuary with plenty of room for passengers and cargo with sliding and reclining 2nd-row seats. The Corsair is very competitively priced at the base level, but if you get into the upper trims with the optional engine upgrade, it can get into the same pricing territory as the bigger, 3-row Aviator. A plug-in hybrid Corsair Grand Touring is on the way, but we haven’t driven it yet as of this writing. Score: 4.2 / 5 From the driver’s seat, the 2020 Porsche Macan lives up to its brand’s legacy. The Macan blends luxury and performance in a way that few competitors can match, but it’s not the most practical choice in this segment. The interior space is a little tight, and its fuel economy is unimpressive, but what the Macan lacks in everyday practicality it makes up for in driving excitement, especially in the higher-performance models. The Macan has the highest starting price on this list by a considerable margin, but it’s also very nice on the base level. Score: 4.1 / 5 The 2020 Alfa Romeo Stelvio is a seductive Italian luxury crossover at a price that’s competitive with its European rivals. The Stelvio delivers a high level of excitement, but not the highest level of refinement. Cargo space is a bit tight, but the cabin is reasonably roomy for passengers. This stylish Alfa boasts best-in-class standard horsepower and torque, and things get really crazy when you upgrade to the high-performance Quadrifoglio model. All of that power is delivered to the road in a composed manner with crisp handling and a comfortable ride. Score: 4.1 / 5 You can look at it from any angle and the 2020 Jaguar F-Pace is unmistakably a Jaguar. The F-Pace delivers real Jaguar performance — especially with its supercharged engine options in the upper trims — but doles out a nice measure of practicality with its generous interior space for both passengers and cargo. This is a nice SUV, but some of the cabin materials are a bit substandard considering the price of this Jag. We like the performance and the roominess, but the F-Pace has one of the highest starting prices in this segment, and its value proposition is questionable. Score: 3.6 / 5 The 2020 Buick Envision is a bit torn between the mainstream and luxury categories. The Envision has a few things going for it like budget-friendly pricing, a strong turbocharged engine option and sliding and reclining back seats, but it’s not up to par with its more expensive competitors in terms of interior luxury or driving excitement. The base engine is dull, and we really recommend springing for the turbo if you’re shopping for an Envision. If you’re looking for the most elegant and opulent compact SUV, you’ll have to shop elsewhere and pay a lot more, but the Envision is good for drivers looking for a luxury bargain. Score: 3.6 / 5 The Land Rover Discovery Sport sits at the bottom of our list because it just isn’t as refined or luxurious as the best small luxury SUVs in this class. Driver-assist technologies that come standard on many competitors are optional in this Land Rover, and its fuel economy is underwhelming, even from the hybrid. Where the Discovery Sport shines is off-road where it’s more capable than most rivals, plus it carries a reasonable base price. Drivers who do most of their driving on the pavement will be better off shopping elsewhere.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/uk-house-prices-surge-to-all-time-high-in-august-2020-09-02?mod=home-page",
    "text": "House prices in the U.K. surged to an all-time high in August, fueled by pent-up demand and record low mortgage rates, according to new figures from Nationwide. Britain’s biggest building society said prices jumped by 2% in August, following a 1.8% rise in July, marking the highest monthly increase since February 2004. Annual house price growth jumped to 3.7% last month from 1.5% in July. The average price was £224,123 ($298,864) in August, up from just under £170,000 10 years ago, Nationwide said. Robert Gardner, Nationwide’s chief economist, said the bounce back in prices reflects the unexpectedly rapid recovery in housing market activity since the easing of lockdown restrictions. “This rebound reflects a number of factors. Pent-up demand is coming through, where decisions taken to move before lockdown are progressing. Behavioral shifts may also be boosting activity, as people reassess their housing needs and preferences as a result of life in lockdown,” he said. The housing market was hit hard in March at the height of the lockdown, as estate agents were forced to close their offices and viewings weren’t allowed. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the next few months are crucial for Barratt because, while the group demonstrated its strength during the lockdown, an extended recession would prove an even tougher test. “The taxpayer funded furlough scheme, mortgage holidays and a ban on evictions are all due to be unwound in the autumn, which all could have major implications on demand for housing going forward,” she said. Read:U.K. jobs picture looks bleak with 7.5 million furloughed or away from their job Shares in Barratt rose 6.91% in early morning London trading. Gardner said that the trends look set to continue in the near term, further boosted by Chancellor Rishi Sunak’s recently announced stamp duty holiday — the transfer tax paid when buying a home. However, Gardner cautioned that most forecasters expect labor market conditions to weaken significantly in the quarters ahead, as a result of the after effects of the pandemic and as government support schemes wind down. “If this comes to pass, it would likely dampen housing activity once again in the quarters ahead,” Gardner said. Shares of Genius Brands International Inc.  jumped 13% in premarket trading Wednesday, after the kids media company said its Kartoon Channel! has acquired \"Adventures of Sonic The Hedgehog\" and \"PAC-MAN and The Ghostly Adventures\" animated series from 41 Entertainment. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. \"Our mission in creating Kartoon Channel! has always been to deliver the best of the best in children's entertainment, and we are excited to add these two series, featuring popular characters that are proven winners and that kids love,\" said Kartoon Channel! General Manager Caroline Tyre. Genius Brands's stock has rocketed 303.4% year to date through Tuesday, while the S&P 500  has gained 9.2%.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/losing-the-extra-600-unemployment-benefit-may-not-have-stopped-americans-from-spending-money-jp-morgan-credit-card-data-shows-2020-08-28?mod=home-page",
    "text": "Whether or not you believe the now-expired $600 weekly unemployment benefit was overly generous or not, like stimulus checks, they allowed more Americans to spend money. But even without the enhanced unemployment benefit, Americans are still reaching for their wallets in stores, restaurants and auto dealerships, data shows. In July, personal spending rose by 1.9%, the government said Friday. That spending happened while more than 30 million jobless Americans were receiving an additional $600 in weekly federal unemployment benefits on top of what they were receiving from their state. That benefit, a provision in the CARES Act, ended at the end of July, and as a result, the average amount of weekly unemployment benefits Americans received fell to $257 from $812. Some economists predicted that one consequence of ending the $600 weekly benefit would be that  Americans would spend less money, which would harm the already-struggling U.S. economy.  One forecast by the Bureau of Economic Analysis suggested that losing the extra $600 would strip more than 20 million Americans of nearly $842 billion to spend. “When the economy’s growth is demand-constrained, anything that keeps households from cutting back on spending actually supports growth,” Josh Bivens, director of research at the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank, said in June. “Cutting off a policy support that helps households maintain spending is a terrible idea, both for these households’ welfare and for macroeconomic stabilization.” Unsurprisingly, that spending is more prevalent in states with low rates of unemployment compared to states with unemployment rates above 7.8%, Chase data shows. “But we see little sign that the benefit expiration has marked a major turning point for the overall economy, as many other high-frequency spending and activity indicators have continued rising into August,” Jesse Edgerton, an economist at J.P. Morgan said in a note to investors. “We conclude that the evidence thus far suggests that the expiration of the extra $600 of weekly unemployment benefits has produced some effects on the data in parts of the economy that are most directly impacted, but it has not marked a sharp turning point for the overall economy,” he wrote. But Ernie Tedeschi, an economist in the Obama-era Treasury Department now at Evercore ISI, is skeptical of that. “Most unemployment insurance benefits are sent via pre-paid debit cards. If those cards aren’t Chase cards, then J.P. Morgan’s analysis may be missing the effect of [the $600 weekly] unemployment insurance expiration.” “In fact, if unemployment insurance recipients are substituting their prior cash benefits with credit card charges, J.P. Morgan may be interpreting that as stronger spending,” he added.“25 to 30 million people losing $600 for a month is roughly $60-$70 billion in lost income. That’s a lot. So much in fact that it’s bound to have some effect.” Democratic lawmakers had pushed to extend the extra $600 through Jan. 2021, deeming it essential to keep struggling American families afloat. But Republicans felt the benefit was too generous, given that two-thirds of jobless Americans were receiving more in unemployment benefits than they did from their prior jobs. The two parties failed to reach a compromise. As a result, President Donald Trump issued a memorandum calling for the distribution of an additional $300 in weekly federal unemployment benefits on top of the state benefits that unemployed people typically receive. The source of that extra $300 is a $44 billion fund set aside for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 35 states have been approved by FEMA to start distributing these funds. As of Friday, six states had started handing out the money. The add-on benefit is set to expire at the end of December, but funds are likely to dry up in a matter of weeks, absent of any legislative action. The president’s executive order deferred, but didn’t forgive, an employee’s Social Security tax liabilities. Elisabeth Buchwald is a personal finance reporter at MarketWatch.

    "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-to-move-in-a-pandemic-2020-09-02?mod=home-page",
    "text": "This article is reprinted by permission from NerdWallet. Moving is stressful enough without throwing a pandemic into the mix. Many Americans may be forced to consider moving as some federal foreclosure and eviction moratoriums have expired. In the first week of July, 32% of Americans did not make a full, on-time housing payment, according to a nationally representative survey by the website Apartment List. Others may relocate to save money, be closer to loved ones or simply leave a densely populated area. If you’re considering moving, here’s what to know from a financial standpoint, as well as tips to make moving day safer. Aside from the usual expenses like buying boxes, renting a van or hiring movers, plan for extra costs because of the pandemic. You may need to buy heavy-duty supplies to deep-clean your old place, for example, or to sanitize your new accommodations. If you are moving out of a rental unit, some landlords may ask you to pay for professional cleaners or take the cost out of your security deposit. The Big Move: I work in Silicon Valley, but my job is now remote. I can finally live somewhere cheaper. Where should I go? Moving across county or state lines? Check what the quarantine requirements are in your new location, says Jean Wilczynski, a certified financial planner and senior wealth adviser at Exencial Wealth Advisors in Old Lyme, Connecticut. You may have to pay for quarantine accommodations like a hotel or Airbnb if your new apartment or home is not move-in ready, she says. If you are receiving unemployment benefits, check the rules on how your benefits carry forward in your new location and what the taxes are if it is a new state, Wilczynski says. You can typically find this information on your state’s Department of Labor website, she says. If you are unemployed or your income has dropped as a result of the pandemic, you can also check whether you qualify for moving assistance by calling 211. You might not be able to really get to know your new place until you’re living there, so prepare yourself (and your wallet) for surprises like leaky faucets or broken appliances. Landlords and real-estate agents may offer only virtual tours. And if you can see the new accommodations in person, you may be required to sign a waiver, wear a mask and avoid touching anything while in the house. How to move safely depends on whether you are doing it yourself or using movers. Current guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that the main way the coronavirus spreads is through respiratory droplets, says Lindsay Slowiczek, pharmacist and drug content integrity manager at Healthline.com. That’s why wearing a mask and staying away from people is important to slow the spread of the virus, she says. Sanitizing surfaces is also an extra precaution worth taking. If you’re renting a moving truck, companies like U-Haul offer contactless pickup and drop-off options. Slowiczek suggests sanitizing the door handles, steering wheel, radio and the metal tongue on the seat belt in the rental van. Before picking a moving company, check its website or call and ask about its safety practices in response to the pandemic, Slowiczek says. Ask whether the movers wear masks and gloves during the move. On moving day, she suggests being prepared with a plan to limit interaction with movers and maintain social distancing. This includes packing as many things as you can yourself, or consider using a self-pack moving container as Slowiczek did for her own recent move. The Big Move: I’m tired of renting in Manhattan, but love living in New York. Is now the time to buy if the city is supposedly dead? If the movers will pack the truck, create a schedule for the movers. For example, ask them to start with a particular room as you stay in another. This is also particularly useful if you live with family members who are vulnerable or immunocompromised, she says. Try to limit their involvement with the move as much as possible. “Plan out the way [the movers] are going to move through the house,” says Slowiczek. “If possible, move all of [your boxes] to one area in your home so they don’t have to come throughout your house as much.” Keep hand sanitizer or soap handy during the move so that you and the movers can use it periodically, she says. (Check on the FDA website that your brand of hand sanitizer is methanol-free, Slowiczek adds). After the move, use disinfectants registered with the Environmental Protection Agency to clean surfaces or furniture. “Just using the product as-is is not enough — read the instructions on how long it should be wet on the surface,” Slowiczek says.

    "title": "Do Commercial Property Tax Changes Affect Residential U.S. Properties?",
    "url": "https://www.mansionglobal.com/articles/do-commercial-property-tax-changes-affect-residential-u-s-properties-219176?mod=home-page",
    "text": "Every week, Mansion Global poses a tax question to real estate tax attorneys. Here is this week’s question. Q. In the U.S., would the increase of commercial property taxes in an area impact—or offset—the need to increase residential property taxes? A. Theoretically, it could, according to Brendan Lynch, a shareholder at the Central Florida law firm Lowndes, Drosdick, Doster, Kantor & Reed. Municipalities “budget for a particular tax amount that they need,” he said. “When they set the millage rates, they're looking at [property] values.” Those values, determined by computer evaluation, help taxing authorities set the millage rate so they will collect the tax amount for which they have budgeted, he noted. Many municipalities in the U.S. use a similar system, and, in some areas, different classes of property are subject to different rates. Florida’s computer evaluation couldn’t be set up to only look at the commercial values while letting residential values go unchanged, according to Mr. Lynch. But each municipality could look at the data differently. “They couldn't do that as a uniform policy, but could that end up being what happens? Absolutely,” he said. “They could maneuver the rates in some ways to have commercial take more of a burden than residential.” However, that doesn’t look like it’s in the cards in the near future, Mr. Lynch noted. If anything, commercial values could decrease next year because of the Covid-19 pandemic, while residential values are likely to rise. But it’s not clear what will happen. “If they know commercial values are going down, how does a municipality just budget for that?” Mr. Lynch asked. “Do they simply attack their budget and try to lower it? Or do they try to keep the same budget and increase the mileage rate? That will be a politically difficult question.” Email your questions to editors@mansionglobal.com.

    "text": "Property prices in the U.K. have recovered from the falls recorded during the height of the coronavirus pandemic to reach an all-time high in August, according to a report Wednesday from Nationwide. Home prices in the country rose 2% in August from July, the highest monthly increase since February 2004. Annually, that pushed up prices 3.7% above last August to an average of £224,123 (US$299,151), the U.K. bank and mortgage provider said. More: J. Lo and A-Rod Find Buyer For Their Malibu Beach Home After Just a Month “House prices have now reversed the losses recorded in May and June and are at a new all-time high,” said Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist, in the report. The rebound is a result of the unexpectedly strong housing market activity that has emerged since the industry reopened in May following its coronavirus closure earlier in spring. “Pent-up demand is coming through where decisions taken to move before lockdown are progressing,” Mr. Gardner said. “Behavioral shifts may also be boosting activity, as people reassess their housing needs and preferences as a result of life in lockdown.” At the high-end, there are now close to twice as many buyers looking for new homes than there were last summer, with demand being driven by a newfound desire for home offices and gardens, according to a separate report released Wednesday from London-based brokerage Savills. The increased demand for new housing looks set to continue in the near term, underpinned by buyers hoping to take advantage of stamp duty holiday savings, according to Nationwide. However “most forecasters expect labor market conditions to weaken significantly in the quarters ahead as a result of the aftereffects of the pandemic and as government support schemes wind down,” Mr. Gardner said. “If this comes to pass, it would likely dampen housing activity once again in the quarters ahead.” COPYRIGHT © 2020 MANSION GLOBAL.

    "text": "SEATTLE, Sept. 3, 2020 -- LumiThera Inc., a commercial stage medical device company creating a photobiomodulation (PBM) treatment for ocular disorders and disease, today announced it is a recipient of a small business innovative research (SBIR) phase II grant from the National Institute of Health (NIH) and the division of the National Eye Institute (NEI). The phase II grant supports a prospective, randomized, multi-center human clinical trial in U.S. subjects diagnosed with Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) and Diabetic Macular Edema (DME). The Photobiomodulation Reduction In Macular Edema (PRIME) trial, which is subject to FDA Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) approval, will test vision and examine disease pathology in the eye following PBM treatments using the Company's Valeda® Light Delivery System. Subjects will be followed for up to 6 months.  In 2018, LumiThera obtained a CE mark to commercialize the Valeda Light Delivery System in Europe for the treatment of dry AMD. Diabetic retinopathy is the most common diabetic eye disease and a leading cause of blindness in American adults.  It is caused by damage to the blood vessels of the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (retina). At first, DR may cause no symptoms or only mild vision problems, but eventually, it can lead to blindness. Diabetic retinopathy can develop in anyone who has type 1 or type 2 diabetes. The longer a patient has diabetes and the less controlled their blood sugar is, the more likely they are to develop this eye complication. Sometimes the central part of the retina (macula) begins to swell (macular edema), a condition called DME that requires treatment. \"Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness worldwide,\" commented Quan Dong Nguyen, M.D., M.Sc. and Diana V. Do, M.D., both professors of ophthalmology at the Byers Eye Institute, Stanford University School of Medicine. \"We will be evaluating if PBM can provide an early treatment for DR and reduce macular edema. If successful, PBM could delay or reduce the need for intravitreal pharmacotherapy with currently approved Anti-VEGF medications or replace invasive laser surgery.\" \"The PRIME study expands LumiThera's global efforts to bring forward PBM treatments for debilitating eye diseases that can result in loss of vision,\" stated David Boyer, M.D., Retina-Vitreous Associates Medical Group, Los Angeles, CA. \"The PRIME study in DME patients would create a novel treatment option for DME patients and expand the Valeda use into a 2nd major therapeutic market.\" \"The NIH clinical grant is substantial in providing over $1.5M in funding to develop a PBM therapy for diabetic patients in the U.S.,\" stated Clark Tedford, Ph.D., President and CEO.  \"We are pleased to have the NIH/NEI partially support the further development endeavors of LumiThera, and the grant is a significant step in the validation of the PBM technology and its potential in treating chronic eye disease.\" \"We are very excited to be part of the PRIME multicenter DME pilot trial,\" remarked Victor Gonzalez, M.D., Valley Retina Institute, McAllen, Texas. \"The U.S. centers and investigators participating in this trial are very well experienced in the treatment of DME and this clinical trial will evaluate a variety of vision and imaging outcomes including Ocumet's mitochondrial and Diopsys' electroretinogram (ERG) functional measures with PBM and set the foundation for expanded use of Valeda in Diabetic Retinopathy and Macular Edema.\" The Coordinating Center for the PRIME Study will be at the Byers Eye Institute at Stanford.  The Ocular Imaging Research and Reading Center (OIRRC, Sunnyvale, CA) will serve as the Reading Center for the Study.

    "text": "BERLIN, Sept. 3, 2020 -- TCL, one of the world's best-selling consumer electronics brands and leading technology companies, is today introducing the company's newest display technology - NXTPAPER - along with two all-new TCL tablets. The company's innovative NXTPAPER display technology is paired with a reflective screen to repurpose natural light, making it the world's first \"zero eye strain\" display that can be used for larger screen surfaces such as tablets. This creates a one of a kind user experience optimized for learning and reading. Additionally, TCL is introducing a pair of 10 Series tablets with the TCL 10 TABMAX and the TCL 10 TABMID, which are productivity powerhouses designed to help unleash your creative side and enable you to get work done from anywhere. \"TCL continues to build upon our deep experience in display technology as well as its vertically integrated consumer electronics ecosystem to develop innovative technologies like NXTPAPER to offer something more to our customers,\" said Jefferson Li, General Manager of the TCL Tablet Product Line. \"This, combined with our first TCL-branded 10 Series tablets, shows how our company continues to provide innovative tablets that meet modern-day demands at a variety of price points. This is even more true now given the current pandemic sweeping the globe and with so many individuals being displaced from traditional office or classroom environments needing powerful, adaptable tablets that allow them to stay productive from anywhere.\" The company's proprietary NXTPAPER display technology is the artistic combination of screen and paper and the culmination of two years of product research and design as well as 11 patents for eye protection. This display technology provides Full-HD definition that offers a paper-like visual experience in full color with no flicker and no harmful blue light. TCL achieves this by combining a highly reflective screen that uses TCL display technology to reuse natural light and has received eye protection certifications from the German Rhine laboratory as well SGS laboratory and German VDE. When compared to traditional e-ink, TCL NXTPAPER has 25 percent higher contrast for better viewing and when compared to a typical LCD panel, TCL NXTPAPER is up to 36 percent thinner creating a device that can be much slimmer and lighter. NXTPAPER display technology is also more than 65 percent more power efficient than a typical LCD, allowing for much better battery efficiency and overall longer device battery life.

The 10.36-inch FHD+ display, 8.3mm narrow bezels and widescreen layout allows you to unleash your creative work without restrictions. You can use the TCL Stylus to draw, write or doodle casually, just like a pencil on paper. With ultra-low latency, a natural in-hand feel and an elegant design, the TCL Stylus is the perfect companion to this tablet. Built to get things done, the TCL 10 TABMAX can handle high-definition video calls, using an advanced dual-microphone system that picks up your voice and uses a noise reduction feature to ensure smooth exchanges. Furthermore, the dual-speaker setup provides a more natural meeting experience, while the 8-megapixel front camera provides more engaging and efficient group communications. Typecover and 4G connectivity ensures you have the freedom to stay connected while on-the-go, and software solutions from Google and Microsoft, allow you to stay productive from anywhere. While long work hours can often put strain on the eyes, the TCL 10 TABMAX also offers intelligent eye protection with no flicker, no harmful blue light and better brightness and tonality when in daylight or low light conditions. It will also signal an alarm if the viewer is within 25cm from the screen, encouraging more distance for eye protection. Parents can leverage Kids Mode to set up a kid-friendly UI and parental controls for added protection. The tablet can also be used as a smart home display, showcasing photos, the weather and traffic; it is integrated with Google Assistant, so you can easily manage tasks and play music using only the sound of your voice. The TCL 10 TABMAX comes with an 8-megapixel front facing camera, a 13-megapixel rear facing camera and a large 8000 mAh battery for all-day use. It will be available across select regions globally in both 4G and Wi-Fi only models beginning in Q4 for €299 EUR and €249 EUR, respectively. The TCL 10 TABMID offers high-quality features in a lighter, sleeker design weighing in at a mere 325g and measuring only 8.5mm thick, making it easy to take along with you. It has an 8-inch FHD IPS display and a whole new scale of innovative display technology with NXTVISION to ensure this tablet screen won't lose its brightness, contrast or color at any angle. It also reduces blue light to relieve visual fatigue and has a reading mode that adjusts the screen to black and white, while adjusting brightness and contrast based on the environment. Entertainment enthusiasts will love its powerful speaker system and deep booming sound for audio and video uses, as well as its Qualcomm® Snapdragon™ 665 processor with an octa-core CPU and a high-performance GPU for online gaming. The TCL 10 TABMID is also a great choice for kids; much like the TCL 10 TABMAX, the TABMID 4G offers a Kids Mode that presents a kid-friendly UI and parental controls. It also works with Google Assistant, allowing you to easily manage tasks, get answers and play music using only the sound of your voice. Powering through movies, games, emails and more, the TCL 10 TABMID comes with a strong 5500 mAh battery for all-day use, a one touch fingerprint sensor for easy log-in and security, as well as a premium, special-edition dark blue back cover.

    "text": "HOPEWELL, N.J., Sept. 3, 2020 -- Our hard of hearing neighbors and colleagues need our help.  Their hearing aids and cochlear implants work extremely well in quiet spaces where the source of sound is within a few feet.  Sound that (1) needs to travel more than six feet, (2) comes from behind a plastic shield or (3) is muffled by a face mask is almost always distorted and unintelligible. Not only do face masks reduce sound by as much as 12 decibels, they prevent lip-reading and block the non-verbal, facial cues that people rely on. Even people with \"average\" hearing find it  difficult to understand speech clearly while masks are worn. One of the most disturbing commentaries on this subject appeared in the Wall Street Journal on July 16. \"The Pandemic Has Made My Hearing Problem Even More of a Problem\" was written by a professional communicator who happens to wear hearing aids. Mary Louise Kelly is co-host of the NPR program, \"All Things Considered.\"  What prompted her to share her story is the experience that she had at a pharmacy counter while trying to pick up a prescription for her son. What's most discouraging about her experience right now, in 2020, is that millions of people just celebrated the 30th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).  It was signed on July 26, 1990 by President George H. W. Bush and it makes perfectly clear what the \"rules of engagement\" are for all members of our communities. It's not funded, and not often enforced, but the ADA does exist. One specific ADA requirement: \"Title II and III entities provide the means to communicate effectively with people who have communications disabilities.\"  The ADA's goal: \"communication with people with these disabilities is equally effective as communication with people without disabilities.\" \"Assistive listening systems and devices\" are explained in the updated and amended ADA that went into effect on March 15, 2011.  It's been nine years since we've known how newer technology should be utilized.   Read the full set of rules here. Rarely does a writer or reporter on this subject raise the point that most organizations do not comply with the rules and intent of the ADA when it comes to providing \"effective communications.\"  If they did respect ADA rules, every face-to-face conversation would be served by an audio induction (hearing) loop system or captioning or, better yet, both forms of assistive technology. A hearing loop system is a seamless, wireless solution that delivers a clear, filtered audio signal to all brands of hearing aids, cochlear implants and telecoil receivers. Hearing loop systems are the consumer-preferred choice for assistive hearing technology and solve a clarity and comprehension problem for all parties to any conversation. Beyond ADA compliance, being the most inclusive and \"hearing-friendly\" organization available to a group of potential customers, patients or employees is a distinct advantage.  For examples of this, or a free site analysis for ADA compliance at your place of business, please visit www.ad4h.com or call 1-833-234-4411. Additional resources on hearing loss, effective communications and assistive hearing technology may be found here: https://ad4h.com/resources/. To advocate for hearing loop systems in your community, visit the Hearing Loss Association of America's website for the  \"Get in the Hearing Loop\" Tool Kit.  The tool kit is published by HLAA on behalf of the 48 million Americans who are hard of hearing.

    "text": "As retailers and restaurants head into Labor Day and start fall recruiting, the Capango Back to Work program provides a mobile social app for contactless restaurant and retail recruiting. STERLING, Va., Sept. 3, 2020 -- Capango Inc. today announced the expansion of its recruiting platform to support restaurants focused on finding great talent as they continue to reopen and expand their service teams. With industry specific questions, a simple to use app and integrated contactless chat and video interview capabilities, Capango has added support for small and large restaurant organizations.  Job seekers now have the ability to quickly see jobs at local retail and restaurant locations while looking for engaging opportunities that match their skillsets. \"After launching our recruiting app to support the retail industry we were approached almost immediately by restaurant owners who had challenges in recruiting and keeping staff,\" said Stefan Midford, Capango President and Founder. \"We launched the Back to Work program in August to support retailers as they reopened and now, we are excited to offer the same industry leading capabilities to restaurants.\" \"After launching our recruiting app to support the retail industry we were approached almost immediately by restaurant owners who had challenges in recruiting and keeping staff,\" said Stefan Midford, Capango President and Founder. \"We launched the Back to Work program in August to support retailers as they reopened and now, we are excited to offer the same industry leading capabilities to restaurants.\" \"Our research identified an enormous opportunity to create a simpler, faster recruiting platform built with a social feel for mobile workers. The recruiting process had not changed materially in decades and the challenges of the past few months make it even more important that we focus on helping workers and employers get back to work again,\" said Stefan. \"When our recruiting team approached me about this partnership with Capango, it was an easy decision. It has been heartbreaking to see and hear the stories around how hard hospitality and restaurant workers have been impacted.  Hospitality is built around in taking care of other people.  With people out of work and our need for workers, it is a natural partnership,\" said Shawn Richard, Vice President of Resident Experience at Holiday Retirement which operates over 260 senior living communities with restaurant-style dining. \"I am excited to partner with Capango to offer a chance to continue doing what they love, just in a different setting they may not have thought about.\" Capango was built to allow job seekers to quickly find local restaurant and retail job opportunities with no resume required.  The seeker simply answers a few questions on a mobile app and they are presented with a matched list of employers. They can then swipe right to work and connect with an employer. \"We've tried a number of other platforms in the past and Capango is more complete and includes the specific restaurant information we need when filling open positions,\" added David Milligan, Executive General Manager at Tusk & Trotter American Brasserie in Bentonville Arkansas. The retail and restaurant industries have been challenged as they work to reopen and have been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19. With over 27 million employees across the country, restaurants and retail are a major employer. In addition, restaurant and retail employers experience turnover exceeding 60% annually and finding and hiring talent is a continual challenge. Getting retail and restaurants fully open again is important for employers and job seekers as well as the communities they support.  With increased sales taxes and a reduced dependence on unemployment benefits, the entire community benefits from a fully engaged workforce.  Capango has simplified the process and focused on working to help ensure this important segment of our economy gets Back to Work. About CapangoCapango has reinvented retail and restaurant recruiting with a platform that instantly connects qualified job seekers to rewarding opportunities.  Using a proprietary scoring algorithm and a dating app-like interface, recruiters and job seekers benefit from a mobile first interactive experience.  Speed to hire is reduced with integrated chat, video interviewing and candidate management. For employers, this means direct access to qualified, passionate workers, making hiring fast and cost-effective.

These extensive dog park updates were made possible through the PetSafe® Bark for Your Park™ program, which provides funding to create and sustain safe, off-leash dog parks nationwide. This dog park was originally made possible nearly a decade ago through a joint partnership with the City of Rocklin Parks & Recreation Department and  RRUFF.  The RRUFF  Healing Heroes Program was added in 2014 and provides funding for service dog training at no cost. With the PetSafe® Bark for Your Park™ grant, the organization was able to make needed maintenance updates to the park to better serve retired veteran visitors and the local community. Phil Lewis, Director of Rocklin Parks & Recreation, says, \"We are proud of all of the hard work RRUFF has put into making the dog park a special gathering place for our community and their four-legged family members. We are delighted for them receiving the PetSafe® Bark for Your Park™ grant, which has allowed them to continue to provide safe and reliable amenities to all those that visit the dog park.\" The one-acre RRUFF Dog Park includes an enticing play area with separate spaces for large, small and special needs animals, providing a safe place for dogs to run free and for their people to connect. The PetSafe® grant was used to maintain the engineered wood fiber groundcover unique to the park and the installation of additional play features for the dogs who visit. \"Our mission is to help communities keep their pets healthy, safe and happy,\" says Celeste Vlok, marketing manager for PetSafe® brand. \"We are grateful for the opportunity to support a park that provides a safe place for dogs of any size, or with special needs, to play off-leash.

The latest report focuses on \"Intelligent Authentication\" (IAuth), which Opus Research defines as a range of solutions and offerings that have evolved since voice-based authentication to include additional biometric factors (facial, fingerprint, behavioral), fraud detection, digital orchestration, and continuous authentication. The firm evaluated products and services from 20 top vendors, focusing specifically on completeness of offerings and ability to orchestrate the performance of a variety of capabilities, including fraud detection, integrations, and business processes that span friction-free authentication. Nuance was commended in the report for its comprehensive, integrated authentication and fraud prevention solution across digital and voice channels and recognized for its industry-leading authentication success rate, fraud prevention rate, and outcome of continuous investment in core technology. Nuance was cited as offering a turnkey solution and the largest voice biometrics platform among vendors evaluated. Nuance customers reported better ROIs, higher fraud loss savings, and higher authentication success rates than organizations deploying competing solutions. \"The top offerings in this report are context-aware, meaning they can take a customer's location, past activity, transaction history, and current intent into account to derive the level of risk to assign to a particular customer or activity,\" said Dan Miller, Lead Analyst, Opus Research. \"They should involve minimum or zero-effort on the part of users. In addition to success establishing trusted communications with customers, Nuance has the ability to support passive enrollment within the course of the conversation, using a speech-enabled IVR, VA, or live agent, which helped the company secure the high rating.\" \"It's an honor to be recognized once again by Opus Research for the sophistication and robustness of our biometric solutions, and I'm exceptionally proud of the team for continually advancing our state-of-the-art solutions,\" said Brett Beranek, General Manager and Vice President, Nuance. \"It's encouraging to see the industry recognize the importance of having solutions that offer flexibility of integration and channel, as well as the winning combination of fraud prevention and authentication.

(NYSE: AVNS) today announced the publication of a large, randomized, multicentered clinical trial comparing the safety and efficacy of COOLIEF* Cooled Radiofrequency ablation to hyaluronic acid (HA) injection for the management of chronic knee pain caused by osteoarthritis. The results from the clinical trial were published in the Journal of Bone & Joint Surgery, the official journal of the American Orthopedic Association. Knee osteoarthritis is a painful and sometimes debilitating condition affecting more than 9 million people in the United States alone. Existing treatments consist of short-lasting and often repetitive nonsurgical options, followed by surgical intervention for those who are appropriate candidates. COOLIEF* Cooled RF is an FDA cleared minimally invasive procedure that has shown extended clinical durability in the management of knee OA pain. This clinical trial enrolled 177 subjects that met inclusion criteria who were subsequently randomized to receive either cooled radiofrequency ablation (CRFA) or a single hyaluronic acid (HA) injection. Subjects were evaluated for pain (Numerical Rating Scale = NRS), function (Western Ontario & McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index = WOMAC), quality of life (Global Perceived Effect = GPE) and safety at 1, 3 and 6 months. At the 6-month timepoint, 71.1% of subjects receiving CRFA reported ≥ 50% pain relief compared to 37.8% of subjects receiving HA. Those receiving CRFA had a 48.2% improvement in WOMAC score at 6 months, compared to 22.6% of subjects treated with HA. Additionally, 72.4% of subjects in the CRFA group reported improvements in GPE compared to 40.2% in the HA group. \"I am very encouraged by the results from this clinical trial,\" said Dr. Lynn Kohan, associate professor at the University of Virginia Medical School, an investigator in the clinical trial. \"The non-operative knee OA patient used to be one of my hardest patients to treat because there simply weren't safe and effective treatments with good clinical durability. Now, when I see these patients, I am excited to share this treatment option with them.\" While the manuscript published today in The Journal of Bone & Joint Surgery represents the 6-month timepoint, the clinical trial was designed to capture longer follow-up with subjects receiving CRFA. The 12-month, 18-month and 24-month timepoints will be reported in future publications. \"We are excited to announce the publication of this trial,\" said Tom Kupec, vice president and general manager, interventional pain at Avanos, \"and I am most pleased about the fact that these results show tremendous consistency in response when compared to previously published trial data on COOLIEF* Cooled RF. We continue to invest in high-quality clinical research and are pleased that these results were accepted for publication in such a prestigious journal.\" About COOLIEF* Cooled RF: COOLIEF* Cooled RF uses water-cooled technology that enables more RF energy to safely deactivate pain-transmitting sensory nerves. This creates a larger, spherical lesion that distally projects 45% or greater beyond the probe's tip, allowing physicians to approach the target nerve from any angle. These features increase the likelihood of successful ablation and improve patient outcomes. COOLIEF* Cooled RF has been shown to provide up to 24 months of pain relief, improved physical functionality, and reduced drug utilization. About Avanos Medical:Avanos Medical (NYSE: AVNS) is a medical technology company focused on delivering clinically superior breakthrough medical device solutions to improve patients' quality of life. Headquartered in Alpharetta, Georgia, Avanos is committed to addressing some of today's most important healthcare needs, such as reducing the use of opioids while helping patients move from surgery to recovery.

    "text": "IRVINE, Calif., Sept. 3, 2020 -- NextAce, the leader in title automation solutions and a wholly owned subsidiary of Fidelity National Financial (NYSE: FNF), announced today the launch of the industry's first \"Virtual Title Assistant,\" which allows title companies to fully adopt title automation in just days while leveraging their existing processes and systems. With the NextAce Virtual Title Assistant, instant title automation is within reach of every title company. Labor savings can be realized without the challenges of traditional technology engagements, as VTA can be fully leveraged almost immediately to allow examiners to complete a traditional examination and produce a full commitment in minutes. \"To build the user experience our customers have been asking for, NextAce created the Virtual Title Assistant to blend seamlessly into their existing examiner workflow\" said President and Founder Don Cantral. \"Our Virtual Title Assistant is built on three fundamental principles: 1) Leveraged Innovation: VTA had to be developed to leverage traditional title processes used to create a full commitment, but VTA had to do this in a radically more efficient way; 2) Turnkey Adoption: VTA had to work with existing technology investments and integrations and be ready for immediate use without traditional time consuming and resource intensive technology engagements; and 3) Hardened Platform Security: VTA had to conform to enhanced security expectations from title companies.\" For NextAce, this resulted in adding additional layers to its core capabilities based on the needs of the industry. The use of automation in the traditional title process has been NextAce's sole business for 17 years, with over 12 million title reports processed. Today, NextAce powers over 20% of the nation's orders while still continuously innovating to add layers of accuracy, security, and savings. In the past, a title company wanting to adopt automation needed a custom software build, had to change their workflows around a new process, and had to provide training for their examiners to transition to using a new interface and process. NextAce's Virtual Title Assistant removes those barriers by creating a setup process that connects their existing data sources, templates, and codebooks, enabling a pre-examined report to be delivered back into their production system in minutes. The ability to cut costs quickly by adopting automation is particularly needed in an unpredictable market. \"In these unprecedented times, every business needs to maximize efficiency. NextAce has been one of our key strategies for managing costs and responding quickly to changing market conditions,\" said Roger Jewkes, Chief Operating Officer, Fidelity National Financial. Fidelity National Financial started investing in NextAce in 2005, and has since acquired the company as a key component in their initiative to modernize the real estate transaction process. The NextAce Virtual Title Assistant empowers title companies by providing tools and efficiencies that support thorough, traditional search and examination in minutes by leveraging their same processes and systems, and by providing the same level of accuracy. With this new solution, NextAce delivers the next level of innovation in title automation. About NextAce:The leading provider of smart automation for title search and examination helps agents, attorneys, and underwriters produce \"Title Reports in Minutes.\" Since 2003, and over 12 million orders, NextAce has saved the title industry over $450 million by using Title Automation to complete most of the process in minutes, before any human touch.

    "text": "NEW YORK, Sept. 3, 2020 -- Phosplatin Therapeutics, a clinical stage pharmaceutical company focused on oncology therapeutics, today announced that new clinical data from a dose escalation study (NCT 03409458) of lead candidate PT-112, an immunogenic cell death inducer, used in combination with PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor avelumab, will be presented at the upcoming European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Virtual Congress 2020 taking place September 19-21. Avelumab is co-developed and co-commercialized by Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany and Pfizer Inc. This abstract is one of only seven abstracts that have been selected for the Mini Oral presentation format in the Investigational Immunotherapy category. Presenter: Daniel D. Karp, MD, Professor, Division of Cancer Medicine, Department of Investigational Cancer Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center Abstracts selected for the on-demand Mini Oral format will be made publicly available at 12:05am CET on Friday September 18, 2020. The Mini Oral presentation will be available on the ESMO website (registration required) from 9am CET on September 18, 2020. \"The data to be presented at the ESMO Virtual Congress 2020 further validate our development hypothesis with PT-112, and the demonstration of its feasibility in combination with immune checkpoint inhibition,\" said Robert Fallon, co-founder and chief executive officer, Phosplatin Therapeutics. \"There is a large, unmet need for patients with advanced cancer not responding to immunotherapy, who essentially have no standard of care. The combination of PT-112 with avelumab has a strong underlying combination rationale based upon PT-112's immunogenic cell death properties, and offers potential for advancing the treatment landscape.\" The study was conducted as part of a collaboration agreement between Phosplatin Therapeutics, Pfizer, Inc. and Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany (EMD Serono in the US and Canada). Under the terms of the collaboration, Phosplatin Therapeutics is the Sponsor of Phase 1b/2a clinical trials in several indications. Pfizer and Merck KGaA supply avelumab for the trials. PT-112 is the ﬁrst small molecule conjugate of pyrophosphate developed in oncology therapeutics. PT-112 promotes immunogenic cell death (ICD), or the release of damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), that lead to downstream immune effector cell recruitment in the tumor microenvironment. PT-112 represents a potential best-in-class small molecule inducer of this immunological form of cancer cell death and is under Phase II development. The ﬁrst in-human study of PT-112 demonstrated an attractive safety proﬁle and evidence of long-lasting responses among heavily pre-treated patients and won \"Best Poster\" at the ESMO 2018 Annual Congress within the Developmental Therapeutics category. The novelty of its pyrophosphate moiety also results in osteotropism, or the propensity of the drug to reach the mineralized bone. This property is of interest in cancer types that originate in bone or frequently lead to metastatic bone involvement, such as metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). The ﬁrst human clinical results in mCRPC were presented at the 2020 Genitourinary Cancers Symposium. Avelumab (BAVENCIO®) is indicated in the US for the maintenance treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) that has not progressed with first-line platinum-containing chemotherapy. BAVENCIO is also indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic UC who have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy, or have disease progression within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy. Avelumab in combination with axitinib is approved in the US for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). In the US, the FDA granted accelerated approval for BAVENCIO for the treatment of adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older with metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC). This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of response. Continued approval may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials. The warnings and precautions for avelumab (BAVENCIO®) include immune-mediated adverse reactions (such as pneumonitis and hepatitis [including fatal cases], colitis, endocrinopathies, nephritis, and other immune-mediated adverse reactions as a single agent or in combination with axitinib [which can be severe and have included fatal cases]), infusion-related reactions, hepatotoxicity in combination with axitinib, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in combination with axitinib [which can be severe and have included fatal cases], and embryo-fetal toxicity. Common adverse reactions (reported in at least 20% of patients) in patients treated with BAVENCIO® monotherapy include fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, diarrhea, nausea, infusion-related reaction peripheral edema, decreased appetite, urinary tract infection and rash. Common adverse reactions (reported in at least 20% of patients) in patients receiving BAVENCIO® in combination with axitinib include diarrhea, fatigue, hypertension, musculoskeletal pain, nausea, mucositis, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, dysphonia, decreased appetite, hypothyroidism, rash, hepatotoxicity, cough, dyspnea, abdominal pain and headache. Grade 3-4 hematology laboratory value abnormalities reported in at least 10% of patients with Merkel cell carcinoma treated with BAVENCIO® monotherapy include lymphopenia; in patients receiving BAVENCIO® in combination with axitinib, grade 3-4 clinical chemistry abnormalities include blood triglyceride increased and lipase increased. http://www.BAVENCIO.com. Phosplatin Therapeutics is a privately held, clinical stage pharmaceutical company that holds exclusive global license to phosphaplatins, a family of small molecules rationally designed to circumvent the mechanisms of drug resistance and toxicity commonly associated with chemotherapeutic regimens. The company's lead candidate, PT-112, is a novel chemical entity under clinical development that exhibits a unique combination of properties, including immunogenic cell death and osteotropism. Clinical data generated to date across three Phase I studies have demonstrated single-agent anti-cancer activity and an attractive tolerability proﬁle, and two Phase II studies of PT-112 are underway. The company's research and development work to date has spanned ﬁfteen countries and been funded by private investors and family investment ofﬁces in the United States, Europe and Asia, along with a sub-license agreement for the development, commercialization and use of PT-112 in Greater China. The company sponsors the ongoing clinical study of PT-112 in combination with the PD-L1 inhibitor avelumab under a collaboration agreement with Pﬁzer and Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany (operating as EMD Serono in the US and Canada). http://phosplatin.com"

About Sutro BiopharmaSutro Biopharma, Inc., located in South San Francisco, is a clinical-stage drug discovery, development and manufacturing company. Using precise protein engineering and rational design, Sutro is advancing next-generation oncology therapeutics. Sutro's proprietary and integrated cell-free protein synthesis platform XpressCF® and site-specific conjugation platform XpressCF+™ led to the discovery of STRO-001 and STRO-002, Sutro's first two internally-developed ADCs. STRO-001 is a CD74-targeting ADC currently being investigated in a Phase 1 clinical trial of patients with advanced B-cell malignancies, including multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. STRO-001 was granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA for multiple myeloma in October 2018. STRO-002 is a folate receptor alpha (FolRα)-targeting ADC, currently being investigated in a Phase 1 clinical trial of patients with ovarian and endometrial cancers. This is the second product candidate to be evaluated in clinical trials resulting from Sutro's XpressCF® and XpressCF+™ technology platforms. A third program, CC-99712 (BCMA-targeting ADC), which is part of Sutro's collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb (formerly Celgene Corporation), is enrolling patients for its Phase 1 clinical trial of patients with multiple myeloma. Sutro's proprietary technology was responsible for the discovery and manufacturing of CC-99712, for which Bristol Myers Squibb has worldwide development and commercialization rights. Sutro is entitled to development and regulatory milestone payments and tiered royalties from Bristol Myers Squibb for this BCMA ADC. Sutro is dedicated to transforming the lives of cancer patients by creating medicines with improved therapeutic profiles for areas of unmet need. To date, Sutro has designed cytokine-based immuno-oncology therapies, ADCs, vaccines and bispecific antibodies primarily directed at clinically-validated targets for which the current standard of care is suboptimal. Sutro's platform allows it to accelerate discovery and development of potential first-in-class and best-in-class molecules through rapid and systematic evaluation of protein structure-activity relationships to create optimized homogeneous product candidates. In addition to developing its own oncology pipeline, Sutro is collaborating with select pharmaceutical and biotech companies to discover and develop novel, next-generation therapeutics. As the pace of clinical development accelerates, Sutro and its partners are developing therapeutics designed to more efficiently kill tumors without harming healthy cells. Additional multimedia content from Sutro regarding STRO-001 and STRO-002 can be found here and here.

    "text": "CAMBRIDGE, Mass. and TARRYTOWN, N.Y., Sept. 3, 2020 -- Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: REGN) will present new, positive data for PD-1 inhibitor Libtayo® (cemiplimab) at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Virtual Congress 2020 from September 19-21. Among the accepted abstracts are two late-breaking oral presentations on the investigational use of Libtayo monotherapy in first-line advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and locally advanced basal cell carcinoma (BCC) previously treated with a hedgehog inhibitor. Additional presentations will include patient-reported quality-of-life and real-world patient data for Libtayo in advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC). \"The Libtayo clinical development program, as monotherapy or in combination with either conventional or novel therapies, focuses on the real-world challenges of patients confronting difficult-to-treat or rare cancers,\" said Peter Adamson, M.D., Global Development Head, Oncology and Pediatric Innovation at Sanofi. \"This development approach was evidenced by the initial approval of Libtayo for patients with advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, and it continues to guide our Libtayo clinical development program for non-small cell lung cancer and basal cell carcinoma.\" \"Libtayo monotherapy continues to demonstrate significant results in pivotal trials across diverse cancers, and we are excited to share these data at ESMO,\" said Israel Lowy, M.D., Ph.D., Senior Vice President, Translational and Clinical Sciences, Oncology, at Regeneron. \"These trial outcomes highlight the potential of Libtayo to advance treatment of non-small cell lung cancer and basal cell carcinoma, and will form the basis for regulatory submissions in the U.S. and European Union.\" Libtayo is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. Libtayo is a fully-human monoclonal antibody targeting the immune checkpoint receptor PD-1 on T-cells. By binding to PD-1, Libtayo has been shown to block cancer cells from using the PD-1 pathway to suppress T-cell activation. Libtayo is the first immunotherapy approved in the U.S., EU, and other countries for adults with metastatic CSCC or locally advanced CSCC who are not candidates for curative surgery or curative radiation. In the U.S., the generic name for Libtayo in its approved indication is cemiplimab-rwlc, with rwlc as the suffix designated in accordance with Nonproprietary Naming of Biological Products Guidance for Industry issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The extensive clinical program for Libtayo is focused on difficult-to-treat cancers. In skin cancer, this includes trials in adjuvant and neoadjuvant CSCC in addition to the pivotal trial in advanced BCC. Libtayo is also being investigated in pivotal trials in NSCLC and cervical cancer, as well as in trials combining Libtayo with either conventional or novel therapeutic approaches for both solid tumors and blood cancers. These potential uses are investigational, and their safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION AND INDICATION FOR U.S. PATIENTS Libtayo is a prescription medicine used to treat people with a type of skin cancer called cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) that has spread or cannot be cured by surgery or radiation. It is not known if Libtayo is safe and effective in children. What is the most important information I should know about Libtayo?Libtayo is a medicine that may treat a type of skin cancer by working with your immune system. Libtayo can cause your immune system to attack normal organs and tissues in any area of your body and can affect the way they work. These problems can sometimes become severe or life-threatening and can lead to death. You can have more than one problem at the same time. These problems may happen anytime during treatment or even after your treatment has ended. Getting medical treatment right away may help keep these problems from becoming more serious. Your healthcare provider will check you for these problems during your treatment with Libtayo. Your healthcare provider may treat you with corticosteroid or hormone replacement medicines. Your healthcare provider may delay or completely stop treatment if you have severe side effects. Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. The most common side effects of Libtayo include tiredness, rash, diarrhea, muscle or bone pain, and nausea. These are not all the possible side effects of Libtayo. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088. You may also report side effects to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi at 1-877-542-8296. Please see accompanying full Prescribing Information, including Medication Guide.

    "url": "https://www.prnewswire.com//news-releases/akebia-therapeutics-announces-top-line-results-from-its-pro2tect-global-phase-3-program-of-vadadustat-for-treatment-of-anemia-due-to-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adult-patients-not-on-dialysis-301123808.html",
    "text": "- Conference call today at 8:30 a.m. ET CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Sept. 3, 2020 -- Akebia Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: AKBA), a biopharmaceutical company with the purpose to better the lives of people impacted by kidney disease, today announces top-line results from PRO2TECT, the second of its two global Phase 3 cardiovascular outcomes programs. The two PRO2TECT studies evaluated the efficacy and safety of vadadustat, Akebia's investigational oral hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor (HIF-PHI), versus darbepoetin alfa for the treatment of anemia due to chronic kidney disease (CKD) in adult patients not on dialysis. The Company's vadadustat development program also includes two other global Phase 3 studies (INNO2VATE) for the treatment of anemia due to CKD in adult patients on dialysis, for which the Company reported positive top-line data in May. Vadadustat achieved the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoint in each of the two PRO2TECT studies, demonstrating non-inferiority (NI) to darbepoetin alfa as measured by a mean change in hemoglobin (Hb) between baseline and the primary evaluation period (weeks 24 to 36) and secondary evaluation period (weeks 40 to 52). Vadadustat did not meet the primary safety endpoint of the PRO2TECT program, defined as non-inferiority of vadadustat versus darbepoetin alfa in time to first occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), which is the composite of all-cause mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke across both PRO2TECT studies. Akebia is working to present the full dataset from its global Phase 3 program (INNO2VATE and PRO2TECT) at an upcoming medical conference and publish the data in peer reviewed journals. Akebia plans to submit to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) a New Drug Application (NDA) for vadadustat for the treatment of anemia due to CKD in adult dialysis-dependent and non-dialysis dependent patients as early as possible in 2021. Akebia and its collaborator, Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., are working in close collaboration to prepare a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for submission to the European Medicines Agency (EMA). \"We remain confident that we have a path toward potential approval for vadadustat in dialysis supported by positive top-line results for efficacy and safety from INNO2VATE.  PRO2TECT delivered positive top-line efficacy results; however, the MACE result presents challenges to achieving our goal of bringing vadadustat to patients in the non-dialysis market. While achieving the MACE endpoint would have made our path here more straightforward, as it is in dialysis, we still believe we have a path toward approval for vadadustat in non-dialysis,\" stated John P. Butler, President and Chief Executive Officer of Akebia Therapeutics. \"We believe the cardiovascular safety of vadadustat is supported by the totality of the data from our global Phase 3 program, including additional analyses on cardiovascular outcomes observed within key geographic regions and across certain patient sub-populations within PRO2TECT.\" Butler continued, \"With data in hand, we and Otsuka have already started working on vadadustat's NDA. At this time, we're planning for a pre-NDA meeting with the FDA before the end of the year, followed by our NDA filing for both the dialysis and non-dialysis indications as early as possible next year. Together with Otsuka, we believe we have an extensive data package to support the potential approval of vadadustat in both indications. We look forward to putting this package in front of health authorities as soon as possible and sharing the full dataset from our global Phase 3 program at an upcoming medical conference.\" Global Phase 3 PRO2TECT Program Akebia's global PRO2TECT program is a cardiovascular outcomes program that includes two separate Phase 3 studies (Correction and Conversion), which collectively enrolled 3,476 adult patients not on dialysis with anemia due to CKD. Both PRO2TECT studies are global, multicenter, open label (sponsor blinded), active-controlled (darbepoetin alfa - an injectable erythropoiesis stimulating agent (ESA)), non-inferiority studies. In both studies, patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either vadadustat or darbepoetin alfa. Vadadustat was initiated at a starting oral dose of 300 mg once daily and adjusted over time in increments of 150 mg within the range of 150 to 600 mg daily using a dose adjustment algorithm, while darbepoetin alfa was dosed per the U.S. package insert (USPI) or summary of product characteristics (SmPCs) in appropriate geographies. The PRO2TECT Correction study evaluated 1,751 patients with anemia due to CKD without recent ESA use (879 and 872 patients randomized to vadadustat and darbepoetin alfa, respectively). The PRO2TECT Conversion study evaluated 1,725 patients with anemia due to CKD on an active ESA treatment (862 and 863 patients randomized to vadadustat and darbepoetin alfa, respectively). In both PRO2TECT studies, the primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change in Hb between baseline and the primary evaluation period (weeks 24-36). Non-inferiority was achieved if the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the between-group difference of the mean Hb change did not fall below the pre-specified NI margin (-0.75 g/dL). The PRO2TECT program's primary safety endpoint, MACE, was independently and blindly assessed by the Brigham and Women's Hospital's Clinical Endpoint Center (BWH CEC) in Boston, MA, with a comparison of vadadustat to darbepoetin alfa. MACE is defined as the composite endpoint of all-cause mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke. To assess MACE, a combined analysis of time to first MACE event from the two PRO2TECT studies was performed. NI was achieved if the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval for the hazard ratio of vadadustat to darbepoetin alfa did not exceed the pre-specified NI margin of 1.25. Primary and Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoint ResultsVadadustat achieved each of the PRO2TECT studies' primary efficacy endpoints of mean change in Hb between baseline and the primary evaluation period (mean Hb from weeks 24 to 36) compared to darbepoetin alfa, in adult patients on dialysis, demonstrating non-inferiority to darbepoetin alfa using an NI margin of -0.75 g/dL prospectively agreed to with FDA and EMA. The incidence of treatment emergent adverse events during the Correction study in the vadadustat-treated patients was 90.9%, and 91.6% in darbepoetin alfa-treated patients. During the study, the most common treatment emergent adverse events reported in vadadustat/darbepoetin alfa-treated patients were end-stage renal disease (34.7%/ 35.2%), hypertension (17.7%/ 22.1.%), hyperkalemia (12.3.%/ 15.6%), urinary tract infection (12.9%/ 12.0%), diarrhea (13.9%/ 10.0%), peripheral oedema (12.5%/ 10.5%), fall (9.6%/ 10%) and nausea (10%/ 8.2%). Serious treatment emergent adverse events were 65.3% for vadadustat-treated patients and 64.5% for darbepoetin alfa-treated patients. The incidence of treatment emergent adverse events during the Conversion study in vadadustat treated patients was 89.1% and 87.7% in darbepoetin alfa-treated patients. During the study, the most common treatment emergent adverse events reported in vadadustat/darbepoetin alfa-treated patients were end-stage renal disease (27.5%/ 28.4%), hypertension (14.4%/ 14.8%), urinary tract infection (12.2%/ 14.5%), diarrhea (13.8.%/ 8.8.%), peripheral oedema (9.9%/ 10.1%) and pneumonia (10.0%/ 9.7%). Serious treatment emergent adverse events were 58.5% for vadadustat-treated patients and 56.6% for darbepoetin alfa-treated patients. \"The results of Akebia's global Phase 3 program continue to underscore the potential of vadadustat as a once-daily oral standard of care for patients living with anemia due to CKD, upon approval,\" stated Steven K. Burke, M.D., Senior Vice President, Research & Development and Chief Medical Officer of Akebia Therapeutics. \"There is a significant unmet medical need among patients living with anemia due to CKD, and we are excited to be advancing vadadustat as a potential therapy for these patients. I would like to extend our sincere thanks to everyone involved in this study, including the patients, physicians, investigators and their staff.\" Investor Conference Call and Live Webcast:Akebia will host a conference call with accompanying slides today, Thursday, September 3, 2020, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss the PRO2TECT data.

About Akebia TherapeuticsAkebia Therapeutics, Inc. is a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company with the purpose to better the lives of people impacted by kidney disease. The Company was founded in 2007 and is headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts. For more information, please visit our website at www.akebia.com, which does not form a part of this release. About VadadustatVadadustat is an oral hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase (HIF-PH) inhibitor designed to mimic the physiologic effect of altitude on oxygen availability. At higher altitudes, the body responds to lower oxygen availability with stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor, which can lead to increased red blood cell production and improved oxygen delivery to tissues. Vadadustat is in global Phase 3 development for the treatment of anemia due to CKD and is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or any regulatory authority with the exception of Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW). In Japan, vadadustat is approved as a treatment for anemia due to CKD in both dialysis-dependent and non-dialysis dependent adult patients. About Anemia due to Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)  Anemia is a condition in which a person lacks enough healthy red blood cells to carry adequate oxygen to the body's tissues. It commonly occurs in people with CKD because their kidneys do not produce enough erythropoietin (EPO), a hormone that helps regulate production of red blood cells. Anemia due to CKD can have a profound impact on a person's quality of life as it can cause fatigue, dizziness, shortness of breath and cognitive dysfunction. Left untreated, anemia leads to deterioration in health and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in people with CKD.

    "url": "https://www.prnewswire.com//news-releases/lodo-therapeutics-acquires-hibiskus-biopharma-and-licenses-rights-to-novel-proteasome-inhibitors-301123605.html",
    "text": "NEW YORK, Sept. 3, 2020 -- Lodo Therapeutics Corp. (Lodo), a biotechnology company reinventing natural product drug discovery by applying its informatics-enabled technology platform to previously undruggable disease targets, today announced that it has completed the acquisition of Hibiskus BioPharma, Inc. (Hibiskus). In a related transaction, Lodo has acquired exclusive worldwide rights from the University of California, Riverside (UCR) and Michigan State University (MSU) to preclinical proteasome and immunoproteasome inhibitors developed by the co-founders of Hibiskus. Together, these two transactions enable Lodo to consolidate the proteasome inhibitor portfolio and related intellectual property, know-how and early stage research. These selective proteasome and immunoproteasome inhibitors were discovered by Hibiskus co-founder and cancer researcher André Bachmann, PhD, Professor of Pediatrics and Associate Chair for Research at Michigan State University, College of Human Medicine, and co-founder Michael Pirrung, PhD, a Distinguished Professor and drug researcher at UCR. Dr. Pirrung is a member of Lodo's Scientific Advisory Board (SAB). Professor Bachmann noted, \"Despite recent advances, far too many cancers remain poorly treated. Preclinical studies conducted at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and elsewhere suggest these novel proteasome inhibitors could potentially play a role in the treatment of a number of solid tumor cancers, and we are delighted that the experienced and committed team at Lodo will now be overseeing their preclinical and clinical development.\" The lead preclinical molecule, TIR-199, now known as LODO-141, is an irreversible and potent hybrid cyclic peptide proteasome inhibitor from the syrbactin natural product family. The foundational work of Dr. Bachmann and his colleagues identifying the proteasome inhibitor properties of the syrbactin family was published in Nature. LODO-141 is structurally distinct from marketed proteasome inhibitors, retains activity against chemoresistance to these inhibitors, and is highly selective with a well-characterized mechanism of action. Studies conducted in chemoresistant cell lines published earlier this year in Leukemia Research showed that LODO-141 is more effective than three marketed proteasome inhibitors in resistant multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma. Preclinical studies conducted by the NCI and other researchers and reported in the Journal of Biological Chemistry produced promising early data. LODO-141 demonstrated antiproliferative activity in multiple human solid tumor cell lines including renal, colon, NSCLC, CNS, melanoma, ovarian, prostate and breast cancer. In vivo efficacy has been demonstrated in a multiple myeloma xenograft model, and most notably, in hollow fiber models of solid tumor carcinomas. These early data support Lodo's plans to develop LODO-141 as a treatment for solid tumors and possibly other cancers. Dale Pfost, PhD, Chairman and CEO of Lodo, commented, \"This is our second targeted transaction at Lodo and reflects our disciplined acquisition strategy based on the extensive experience of our senior team in executing value-creating transactions. We believe these novel proteasome inhibitors are an excellent fit for Lodo. They are derived from natural products and have the potential for improved efficacy and therapeutic index compared to existing proteasome inhibitors, a mainstay of multiple myeloma treatment. Early studies conducted at the NCI and elsewhere suggest that LODO-141 may have utility in treating solid tumors. We intend to assess its potential as a single agent and also in combination with cancer immunotherapy.\" Dr. Pfost added, \"Importantly, these compounds are compatible with our next-generation drug discovery technology, and we anticipate using our P4 Platform to optimize manufacturing and identify additional analogs with potential improvements in anti-cancer activity and safety profile. Lodo is uniquely positioned to expand the chemical space around these molecules with clearly differentiated profiles that we intend to develop specifically for the treatment of solid tumors.\" Dr. Pirrung noted, \"I am pleased that Lodo will be developing our novel proteasome inhibitors and exploring ways to expand their utility. As a member of Lodo's SAB with long-standing interests in natural product derived drugs, I appreciate the potential of Lodo's platform to transform natural product drug discovery by making it rational, efficient and highly productive. My past work with Lodo CEO Dale Pfost and CFO Don Marvin, along with the talented team of scientists they have assembled, bode well for their success in reinventing this rich source of innovative drugs.\" The addition of the proteasome and immunoproteasome inhibitor portfolio via the license from UCR, along with the insights and know-how Lodo is acquiring from Hibiskus, expands the company's pipeline of novel cancer compounds. Lodo anticipates having candidates from two initiatives—its Wnt pathway inhibitor program and selective proteasome inhibitor program—positioned to begin clinical testing starting in 2023. Hibiskus BioPharma was established with support from Spartan Innovations and Red Cedar Ventures, both wholly owned subsidies of the Michigan State University Foundation. Lodo is acquiring all the operating assets of Hibiskus and consolidating them at its facilities in New York City. Further financial details of the transactions were not disclosed. About Lodo TherapeuticsLodo is reinventing natural product drug discovery with its technology enabled P4 Platform™ and  ClusterTech™ suite of informatics tools.

    "url": "https://www.prnewswire.com//news-releases/cms-grants-additional-reimbursement-for-the-eluvia-drug-eluting-vascular-stent-system-301123650.html",
    "text": "MARLBOROUGH, Mass., Sept. 3, 2020 -- Boston Scientific (NYSE: BSX) announced that the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) granted a New Technology Add-on Payment (NTAP) for the Eluvia™ Drug-Eluting Vascular Stent System as part of the 2021 Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS). The NTAP designation, awarded to new medical devices determined to substantially improve the diagnosis or treatment of Medicare beneficiaries, will be effective on October 1, 2020 and will provide eligible hospitals with incremental reimbursement for the Eluvia stent system for up to three years. The Medicare criteria for an NTAP designation is based on newness of the device, cost and a substantial clinical improvement. The Eluvia stent system was developed for the treatment of peripheral artery disease (PAD) – the narrowing of the arteries of the legs due to plaque buildup – which affects approximately 8.5 million people in the United States and more than 200 million people worldwide.[i],[ii] Left untreated, PAD restricts blood flow to the legs and feet and patients often experience pain, swelling and a diminished quality of life. The Eluvia stent re-opens the blocked artery and restores blood flow, while also utilizing a drug-polymer combination to offer a sustained, low-dose release of drug to prevent tissue regrowth within the stented artery. \"The CMS determination is a very positive development for patients with PAD and supports what we have confirmed through our clinical trials – the Eluvia stent offers clinically superior outcomes compared to other peripheral drug-coated technology available to clinicians and their patients,\" said Jeff Mirviss, executive vice president and president, Peripheral Interventions, Boston Scientific. \"The decision is particularly important given the level of consideration and evaluation related to the role of paclitaxel in the peripheral vasculature, and we believe this designation reflects the unique attributes of the Eluvia stent, which are clearly differentiated and improve the quality of life for the millions of people suffering from symptoms of PAD.\" The NTAP designation will support access to the Eluvia stent for Medicare beneficiaries in the hospital inpatient setting, making it possible for eligible hospitals to receive NTAP payment in addition to the standard Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Group (MS-DRG) payment. The FDA approval of the Eluvia stent system in September 2018 was based on findings from the IMPERIAL trial, which exhibited the highest 24-month primary patency reported to date for the treatment of femoropopliteal disease in a U.S. pivotal trial with a drug-coated balloon or drug-eluting stent.[iii] Trial data confirmed a statistically significant lower clinically-driven target lesion revascularization (TLR) rate of 12.7% for patients treated with the Eluvia stent, in contrast to 20.1% observed within the Zilver® PTX® Drug-Eluting Peripheral Stent cohort (p=0.0495), thus reducing the need for repeat procedures at 24 months.[iv] Additional information on the Eluvia stent system can be found online at www.bostonscientific.com/drugeluting.

    "url": "https://www.prnewswire.com//news-releases/late-breaking-libtayo-cemiplimab-pivotal-data-in-advanced-non-small-cell-lung-cancer-and-basal-cell-carcinoma-to-be-presented-at-esmo-301123657.html",
    "text": "TARRYTOWN, N.Y. and CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Sept. 3, 2020 -- Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced the presentation of new, positive data for the PD-1 inhibitor Libtayo® (cemiplimab) at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Virtual Congress 2020 from September 19-21. Among the accepted abstracts are two late-breaking oral presentations on the investigational use of Libtayo monotherapy in first-line advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and locally advanced basal cell carcinoma (BCC) previously treated with a hedgehog inhibitor. Additional presentations will include patient-reported quality-of-life and real-world patient data for Libtayo in advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC). \"Libtayo monotherapy continues to demonstrate significant results in pivotal trials across diverse cancers, and we are excited to share these data at ESMO,\" said Israel Lowy, M.D., Ph.D., Senior Vice President, Translational and Clinical Sciences, Oncology, at Regeneron. \"These trial outcomes highlight the potential of Libtayo to advance treatment of non-small cell lung cancer and basal cell carcinoma, and will form the basis for regulatory submissions in the U.S. and European Union.\" \"The Libtayo clinical development program, as monotherapy or in combination with either conventional or novel therapies, focuses on the real-world challenges of patients confronting difficult-to-treat or rare cancers,\" said Peter Adamson, M.D., Global Development Head, Oncology and Pediatric Innovation at Sanofi. \"This development approach was evidenced by the initial approval of Libtayo for patients with advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, and it continues to guide our Libtayo clinical development program for non-small cell lung cancer and basal cell carcinoma.\" Libtayo is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. Libtayo was invented using Regeneron's VelocImmune® technology that utilizes a proprietary genetically-engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically-humanized immune system to produce optimized fully-human antibodies. VelocImmune technology has been used to create multiple antibodies including Dupixent® (dupilumab), Praluent® (alirocumab) and Kevzara® (sarilumab), which are approved in multiple countries around the world. Regeneron previously used these technologies to rapidly develop a treatment for Ebola virus infection, which is currently under review by the FDA, and to create REGN-COV2, a potentially preventative and therapeutic medicine for COVID-19. Libtayo is a fully-human monoclonal antibody targeting the immune checkpoint receptor PD-1 on T-cells. By binding to PD-1, Libtayo has been shown to block cancer cells from using the PD-1 pathway to suppress T-cell activation. Libtayo is the first immunotherapy approved in the U.S., EU, and other countries for adults with metastatic CSCC or locally advanced CSCC who are not candidates for curative surgery or curative radiation. In the U.S., the generic name for Libtayo in its approved indication is cemiplimab-rwlc, with rwlc as the suffix designated in accordance with Nonproprietary Naming of Biological Products Guidance for Industry issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The extensive clinical program for Libtayo is focused on difficult-to-treat cancers. In skin cancer, this includes trials in adjuvant and neoadjuvant CSCC in addition to the pivotal trial in advanced BCC. Libtayo is also being investigated in pivotal trials in NSCLC and cervical cancer, as well as in trials combining Libtayo with either conventional or novel therapeutic approaches for both solid tumors and blood cancers. These potential uses are investigational, and their safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION AND INDICATION FOR U.S. PATIENTS Libtayo is a prescription medicine used to treat people with a type of skin cancer called cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) that has spread or cannot be cured by surgery or radiation. It is not known if Libtayo is safe and effective in children. Libtayo is a medicine that may treat a type of skin cancer by working with your immune system. Libtayo can cause your immune system to attack normal organs and tissues in any area of your body and can affect the way they work. These problems can sometimes become severe or life-threatening and can lead to death. You can have more than one problem at the same time. These problems may happen anytime during treatment or even after your treatment has ended. Getting medical treatment right away may help keep these problems from becoming more serious. Your healthcare provider will check you for these problems during your treatment with Libtayo. Your healthcare provider may treat you with corticosteroid or hormone replacement medicines. Your healthcare provider may delay or completely stop treatment if you have severe side effects. Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. The most common side effects of Libtayo include tiredness, rash, diarrhea, muscle or bone pain, and nausea. These are not all the possible side effects of Libtayo. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088. You may also report side effects to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi at 1-877-542-8296. Please see accompanying full Prescribing Information, including Medication Guide.

    "text": "New virtual selling model and digital investments drive sales across channels. HAMILTON, Bermuda, Sept. 3, 2020 -- Signet Jewelers Limited (\"Signet\") (NYSE:SIG), the world's largest retailer of diamond jewelry, today announced its results for the 13 weeks ended August 1, 2020 (\"second quarter Fiscal 2021\"). \"Sales improved sequentially throughout the second quarter as we reopened stores and remained agile and innovative in these unprecedented times. During the quarter, we also scaled our new virtual selling model, improved our merchandise assortment, and enhanced our targeted digital marketing to a strong consumer response,\" said Virginia C. Drosos, Chief Executive Officer. \"While same store sales were down 31.3% in the quarter given store closures, same store sales turned positive in late Q2 as we reached scale on store re-openings while driving high double-digit growth in eCommerce. Momentum has continued into Q3 with preliminary August same store sales of 10.9% and eCommerce growth of 65.2%. In response to COVID-19 impacts, we quickly pivoted to accelerate our OmniChannel transformation while also focusing on cash preservation. This allowed us to further invest in 'digital-first' initiatives, including new virtual selling capabilities. In the second quarter, we served more than 300,000 customers through virtual consultations which achieved higher than historical conversion rates. We also increased our eCommerce distribution throughput five-fold and will continue to invest in digital capabilities to accelerate growth and position Signet to gain market share. I am incredibly proud to be part of this company and want to thank each and every team member for their extraordinary contributions. We have been consistently guided by our purpose and core values, prioritizing the health and safety of our employees and customers and speaking out against racial injustice and inequality. We continue to keep all of those who are suffering from the COVID-19 pandemic in our thoughts and prayers and appreciate the resilience and compassion of all front-line workers.\" 888.0 1,364.4 1,740.1 2,796.1 (31.3) (1.5) (35.2) (1.4) (89.7) (22.4) (389.3) (25.0) (10.1) (1.6) (22.4) (0.9) (1.73) (0.86) (5.69) (1.21) (41.7) 53.1 (184.2) 77.3 (4.7) 3.9 (10.6) 2.8 (1.13) 0.51 (2.72) 0.59 (1) Same store sales include physical store sales and eCommerce sales. (2) See non-GAAP reconciliation page. Consistent with the Company's digital first strategy, Signet increased investment in Signet's OmniChannel platform, driving growth and leveraging scale to position it for increased market share and an even stronger leadership position in the category. The Company has implemented a full-time virtual selling team, as well as empowered more than 15,000 store associates to engage with customers via virtual selling from their homes or in their respective stores. Signet's investment in virtual selling is producing higher levels of conversion on digital and retail foot traffic. While the macro environment remains uncertain, the Company believes that it is prepared, through both its virtual and physical footprints, to serve customers wherever they want to shop and however this upcoming holiday season unfolds. Signet's physical footprint remains a key component of its competitive strategy. The Company currently has more than 90% of its total fleet open with safety prioritized through Signet's new Love Takes Care initiative that includes safety protocols developed with leading healthcare professionals. The Company believes the safe shopping environment provided by the Company's brick and mortar stores is contributing to sequential monthly sales improvements. Signet has closed 293 of the previously announced 380 stores in this fiscal year's footprint optimization effort. The Company is maintaining cost containment efforts and net structural cost savings are on track to exceed $100 million in FY21. Now in the third year of Path to Brilliance, the Company expects net savings of at least $285 million versus its original target of $225 million. A reduction in force this quarter contributed to these cost savings. These difficult decisions were made thoughtfully to better align the workforce to a more streamlined structure and digitally focused cultures. Signet's total sales were $888.0 million, down 34.9% year over year, in the 13 weeks ended August 1, 2020 on a reported basis and down 34.8% on a constant currency basis. Total same store sales declined 31.3% year over year. eCommerce sales were $270.1 million, up 72.1%. Brick and mortar same store sales declined 46.0%. For safety reasons, the Company's design and service centers were closed until later in the quarter. Because of this, revenue recognition related to Signet's extended service plan programs was lower than last year and negatively impacted same store sales by roughly 450 basis points. (30.6) (3.0) (33.6) (0.1) (33.7) 823.0 (38.8) (7.3) (46.1) (0.3) (46.4) 61.0 4.0 (31.3) (3.5) (34.8) (0.1) (34.9) 888.0 (1) Includes sales from Signet's diamond sourcing initiative. GAAP gross margin was $224.3 million, or 25.3% of sales, down 830 bps versus the prior year quarter. The majority of gross margin rate decline is due to a deleveraging on fixed costs resulting from lower sales. The remainder of the decline resulted from Signet's lower revenue recognition relating to extended service plan programs. The rate decline was partially offset through structural cost savings, lower occupancy costs and lower inventory related costs. SGA was $265.9 million, or 29.9% of sales,  was 30 bps favorable to last year's SGA of $411.4 million. The improvement to SGA was primarily driven by lower labor costs and lower advertising expense. GAAP operating loss was $(89.7) million or (10.1)% of sales. The loss compares to $(22.4) million, or (1.6)% of sales in the prior year second quarter. Non-GAAP operating loss was $(41.7) million, or (4.7)% of sales, compared to Non-GAAP operating income of $53.1 million, or 3.9% of sales in prior year second quarter. Non-GAAP operating loss excluded $28.7 million in restructuring charges related to the Path to Brilliance transformation plan as well as $20.3 million related to the impairment of ROU assets and property, plant and equipment. (57.0) (6.9) 11.8 1.0 (15.6) (25.6) (1.6) (1.4) (0.2) (9.1) (16.9) (23.5) (89.7) (10.1) (22.4) (1.6) (12.0) (1.5) 73.6 5.9 (11.8) (19.3) (1.0) (0.9) (0.2) (6.4) (17.7) (13.1) (41.7) (4.7) 53.1 3.9 The current quarter GAAP income tax benefit was $17.2 million compared to income tax expense of $3.8 million in the prior year second quarter. On a non-GAAP basis the income tax benefit was $0.2 million. GAAP EPS was $(1.73), including $0.55 in restructuring charges related to the Path to Brilliance transformation plan. Excluding restructuring and asset impairment charges (and related tax effects), EPS was $(1.13) on a non-GAAP basis. GAAP and non-GAAP EPS in the quarter are based on net income (loss) available to common shareholders as the preferred shares are anti-dilutive and excluded from the ending share count due to the second quarter net loss. Signet continues to focus on cash in this economic climate, as the Company believes it is the first defense against uncertainty and protects its ability to fund growth initiatives. Continued cost diligence and working capital efficiency led to a reduction in inventory of $79 million to the prior year second quarter and cash flow from operating activities of  $156.1 million. Cash and cash equivalents were $1.20 billion, compared to $271.5 million at the prior year quarter end. Signet notes that long term debt of $1.34 billion, compared to $628.2 million at the prior year quarter end. Signet's Board of Directors has elected to maintain the temporary suspension of the dividend program on the common shares and has elected to pay the November quarterly dividend on its preference shares in kind. While Signet is encouraged by customers' response to the Company's digital first strategy and investments, looking to the second half of this fiscal year, the Company is not providing financial guidance. This is due to the continuing uncertainty surrounding multiple factors including the magnitude and potential resurgence of COVID-19 in key trade areas, extended duration of heightened unemployment, supply chain disruptions and macro or governmental influences on consumers' ability to spend, particularly in discretionary categories like jewelry.   Further, there can be no assurance that August sales trends will continue for the remainder of the third quarter and are not indicative of future performance.

    "title": "Genesco Inc. Reports Fiscal 2021 Second Quarter Results",
    "url": "https://www.prnewswire.com//news-releases/genesco-inc-reports-fiscal-2021-second-quarter-results-301123485.html",
    "text": "NASHVILLE, Tenn., Sept. 3, 2020 -- Genesco Inc. (NYSE: GCO) today reported a GAAP loss from continuing operations per diluted share of ($1.33) for the three months ended August 1, 2020, compared to earnings from continuing operations per diluted share of $0.05 in the second quarter last year.  Adjusted for the excluded items in both periods, the Company reported a second quarter loss from continuing operations per diluted share of ($1.23), compared to earnings from continuing operations per diluted share of $0.15 last year. Mimi E. Vaughn, Genesco Board Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, \"The second quarter began with consumers enthusiastically returning to our physical locations as we began reopening stores and continuing to actively engage and shop with us online. The speed and executional excellence our teams demonstrated in getting our stores open and operational was a huge advantage as we often opened on the first day permitted by local authorities.  Despite our stores being open for about 70% of the days in the second quarter, total net revenue decreased only 20% as the drop in store volume was partially offset by a notable 144% increase in e-commerce sales as we pivoted to digital. Equally encouraging was our ability to reduce expenses and inventories in line with sales and to generate cash during the quarter.  Journeys generated a positive operating income for the quarter, but gross margin headwinds especially at Johnston & Murphy and Schuh led to a consolidated operating loss. \"Towards the end of the second quarter and to begin the third quarter, our business in North America was significantly impacted by the changes in back-to-school timing brought on by the pandemic. This includes schools in several areas of the country starting later than last year and many others not returning to in-person learning. As such we believe the back-to-school selling season will extend deeper into the third quarter which has limited visibility as we head into the back half. I am incredibly proud of how our teams have responded to the unprecedented challenges we've faced thus far in Fiscal 2021.  This, along with the strong strategic positioning of our businesses and current liquidity, gives me confidence that we will successfully weather this storm and emerge strong to take advantage of the many opportunities on the other side.\" Store Re-Opening UpdateCurrently, the Company is operating in 96% of its locations, including approximately 1,130 Journeys, 160 Johnston & Murphy, and 125 Schuh locations. All store locations are operating under enhanced measures to ensure the health and safety of employees and customers. Second Quarter ReviewNet sales for the second quarter of Fiscal 2021 decreased 20% to $391 million from $487 million in the second quarter of Fiscal 2020.  This sales decrease was driven by store closures, a later start to back-to-school, lower store comps and lower wholesale sales, partially offset by digital comp growth of 144%.  As a result of the store closures and gradual reopening of stores in response to COVID-19, the Company has not included second quarter Fiscal 2021 comparable sales, except for comparable direct sales, as it believes that overall sales is a more meaningful metric during this period. Overall sales were down 12% for Journeys, 22% at Schuh, and 64% at J&M while sales were up 62% at Licensed Brands due to the Togast acquisition. Second quarter gross margin this year was 42.7%, down 590 basis points, compared with 48.6% last year. The decrease as a percentage of sales is due primarily to higher shipping and warehouse expense in all divisions driven by the increase in penetration of e-commerce, significant inventory reserves taken at Johnston & Murphy, and increased promotional activity at Schuh. Adjusted selling and administrative expense for the second quarter this year increased 40 basis points as a percentage of net sales due to lower sales as a result of COVID-19. On a dollar basis, expenses decreased 19% compared to the same period last year driven by disciplined expense management, including: reduced selling salaries, occupancy, and compensation expense along with lower travel, advertising and bonus expenses. Genesco's GAAP operating loss for the second quarter was $(22.0) million, or (5.6)% of sales this year compared with operating income of $3.0 million, or 0.6% of sales last year.  Adjusted for the excluded items in both periods, the operating loss for the second quarter was $(20.9) million this year compared with operating income of $4.7 million last year.  Adjusted operating margin was (5.3)% of sales in the second quarter of Fiscal 2021 and 1.0% last year. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.3% in Fiscal 2021 compared to 70.7% last year.  The adjusted tax rate, reflecting excluded items, was 23.0% in Fiscal 2021 compared to 45.2% last year.  The lower adjusted tax rate for this year primarily reflects the inability to recognize a tax benefit for certain foreign losses. The GAAP loss from continuing operations was $(18.9) million in the second quarter of Fiscal 2021, compared to earnings from continuing operations of $0.8 million in the second quarter last year.  Adjusted for the excluded items in both periods, the second quarter loss from continuing operations was $(17.4) million, or ($1.23) loss per share in Fiscal 2021, compared to earnings from continuing operations of $2.5 million, or $0.15 earnings per share last year. Cash, Borrowings and InventoryCash and cash equivalents at August 1, 2020, were $299.1 million, compared with $58.0 million at August 3, 2019.  Cash increased $60.6 million during the second quarter driven primarily by operating activities generating $74.4 million, partially offset by a use of cash in financing activities of $12.0 million, capital expenditures and other activities.  Total debt at the end of the second quarter of Fiscal 2021 was $210.9 million compared with $75.1 million at the end of last year's second quarter. Total unused availability as of August 1, 2020 was $63.4 million.  Inventories decreased 18% in the second quarter of Fiscal 2021 on a year-over-year basis. Capital Expenditures and Store ActivityFor the second quarter, capital expenditures were $4 million, primarily related to digital and omni-channel initiatives and store projects already in progress.  Depreciation and amortization was $12 million.  During the quarter, the Company opened three new stores and closed six stores.  The Company ended the quarter with 1,476 stores compared with 1,494 stores at the end of the second quarter last year, or a decrease of 1%.  Square footage was down 1% on a year-over-year basis. Share RepurchasesThe Company did not repurchase any shares during the second quarter of Fiscal 2021. Fiscal 2021 Outlook Due to the continued uncertainty in the overall economy driven by COVID-19, the Company is not providing guidance at this time.

    "text": "SHENZHEN, China, Sept. 3, 2020 -- vivo kicked off the \"Night Artist\" campaign last month on social media to find talented nighttime photography artists from around the world, attracting a wide range of users and KOLs, including the award-winning global photographer Chris Hau and outdoor explorer and photographer Samuel Elkins. With the revolutionary nighttime photography capabilities of vivo's flagship X50 series, the campaign called on users to capture the tranquility and dynamism of summer nights and demonstrated vivo's leading technology breakthroughs in mobile photography. The campaign, which kicked off on August 19, encouraged users to share their shots of a starry or urban night sky on social media. Amid the hustle and bustle of day to day life, people seldom stop and appreciate the little things around them. By participating in this campaign, night artists were welcomed to reexamine life through new perspectives under the night sky, using vivo's innovative features like the Gimbal Camera System and Astro Mode. Inspired by the vivo campaign, Chris Hau and Samuel Elkins launched a challenge, which has gained support from around the world, including from Southeast Asia, Russia, and Ukraine, with a number of regional KOLs participating in it and sharing stunning photographs on social media. As a smartphone maker who has been seeking to bring users with exciting photography experience, vivo launched X50 series in June, with a global launch in July. The new product lineup, including X50, X50 Pro, and X50 Pro+, is launched with an ambition of redefining the mobile photography. Building on vivo's long-standing pursuit for innovations, X50 Pro is equipped with a new Gimbal Camera System, enabling users to take high-quality photos in motion, even during nighttime, while Astro Mode and Super Night Mode allow users to capture excellent photos of a starry or urban night sky. The Extreme Night Vision and Pro Sports Mode of X50 Pro+ also help users capture stunning photos in dark environments. vivo has excellent performance in self-portraits, portraits, night, sports and other modes, covering all aspects of daily photography. While giving clearer pictures, vivo photography keeps striving to be more aesthetic, artistic, and professional. Samuel Elkins, a professional photographer who is experienced in phone reviews, went to southern California, exploring a few features of X50 series that helped him produce amazing blue-hour and nighttime photography in the town of Lone Pine. At dusk, Samuel was able to shoot crystal-clear photos with no grains by using the Pro Sports Mode to adjust the shutter speed and the ISO sensitivity. He noticed the level of the detail, even in the shadows, was incredible. Using Astro Mode, he also took stunning photos of the Milky Way. Samuel recommended locking the phone on a tripod and utilizing the self-timer feature to further stabilize the image, making it even more user-friendly so that every person can capture the beauty of the California night sky. An award-winning photographer and influencer in travel and technology, Chris Hau, explored vivo's night photography features in Toronto and shared some helpful tips for capturing photos with X50 series. He suggested flipping the phone upside down and taking advantage of having the camera lens close to the ground in order to get an amazing reflection when shooting a water surface. What's more, the built-in filters are like icing on a cake, making nighttime photos even more stunning. Right after the two KOLs published their video reviews online, they gained lots of positive responses, with viewers commenting that they loved the concept and could not believe the high-quality nighttime photos were shot on a smartphone. As wanderlust takes over the whole world, the campaign attracted enthusiastic photographers and audiences in various countries, amazed by the delicate features of X50 series and the stunning night photographs taken. Experienced, professional photographers know that astrophotography is time-intensive and extremely challenging, and often requires a professional camera to yield excellent results. However, with Astro Mode, Extreme Night Vision, and other features, X50 series helps users capture professional-grade photos of the night sky, offering truly redefined mobile photography experience. vivo has been a pioneer in mobile photography technology, continuously delivering hardware and software innovations that enhance the user experience and address common user problems. In 2018, vivo's NEX was the first smartphone with a pop-up selfie camera, which enabled the device to have a bezel-free Ultra FullView™ Display. On subsequent devices, vivo continued innovating to reduce the pop-up time from one second to 0.62 seconds, making it more convenient for users. With selfie capabilities a top priority, vivo also increased the front camera from 1.3MP to 32MP over time, allowing users to capture more beautiful and detailed selfie photos. vivo made another significant breakthrough on X50 Pro with the Gimbal Camera System, a built-in gimbal module that delivers ultimate stabilization for photos and videos shot in motion. Night Mode, now upgraded to Super Night Mode, has empowered users to capture professional-grade photos and videos in low-light scenarios. vivo is a leading, product-driven, global technology company, with its core business focusing on smart devices and intelligent services. vivo is committed to connecting users around the globe, through design of exciting and innovative smartphones and companion devices, as well as services which integrate technology and design thinking in unique and creative ways.

The report also provides a detailed analysis of the COVID-19 impact on the biodegradable tableware market.

Growth of the overall global biodegradable tableware market has also been forecasted for the period 2020-2024, taking into consideration the previous growth patterns, the growth drivers and the current and future trends. The global biodegradable tableware market is considerably fragmented with many major market players operating worldwide. The manufacturers of biodegradable tableware produce different products to cater to the needs of various sectors. The key players of the biodegradable tableware market are Huhtamaki Oyj, Reynolds Group Holdings Limited (Pactiv LLC), BIOTREM Sp. z o.o., and Georgia-Pacific LLC are also profiled with their financial information and respective business strategies. As more and more people are becoming aware to reduce plastic waste as well as greenhouse emissions, there is a growing trend for adopting green solutions and environment-friendly products. One such solution is the introduction of biodegradable and compostable tableware. Biodegradable tableware is fully compostable and made from natural materials, such as corn starch, sugarcane pulp, bamboo, fallen paper, rice husk, palm leaves, and recycled paper. Biodegradable tableware products are considered an eco-friendly alternative to traditional disposable tableware products. The major benefits provided by biodegradable tableware products include easy composting, energy-efficient, made from sustainable and renewable base material, non-toxic to health, safe for kids, and reduce water pollution and landfill mass. The biodegradable tableware market can be segmented on the basis of product type (Cups, Trays, Plates, Bowl, Containers, Straw, Spoons, Reusable Dishware, and Others); raw material type (Wood, Bamboo, Plastic, Paper, Husk, Wheat Bran, Palm Leaf, Bagasse, and Others); application (Households, Hotels, Food Joints & Takeaways, and Others); and distribution channel (Online, and Offline). The global biodegradable tableware market has increased significantly during the years 2017-2019 and projections are made that the market would rise in the next four years i.e. 2020-2024 tremendously. The biodegradable tableware market is expected to increase due to rapid urbanization, increasing spending of the middle-class population, surging Quick Service Restaurant (QSR) Industry, favorable government and non-government organizations initiatives, growing awareness regarding the adverse effects of plastic, etc. Yet the market faces some challenges such as high cost of biodegradable tableware products, low or zero foot traffic across foodservice sectors due to COVID-19. 1.

Klasing, our experienced tax attorneys and CPAs are here to advise you on when and how you must file this form, the potential consequences for not filing, and how we can assist you throughout the process especially if a civil or criminal controversy develops over this reporting requirement. For purposes of Form 8300, a \"person\" is an individual, company, corporation, partnership, association, trust, or estate.  A transaction is defined as a lump sum, two or more related payments within 24 hours, or two or more related transactions within a 12 month period. Any coins or currency of the United States or any foreign nation qualify as cash, as well as cash equivalents that include cashier's checks, bank drafts, traveler's checks or money orders. If cash equivalents and cash are combined as part of a single transaction to reach more than $10,000, the transaction must be reported. Generally, qualifying cash transactions must be reported by filing the form within 15 days after you receive the cash, unless the 15th day falls on a weekend or holiday, in which case you have until the next business day. The Form 8300 civil penalty for failure to accurately include all required information is $270 per required form. If failure was intentional or willful, the civil penalty will be the greater of $27,820 or the amount of cash received in the transaction, not to exceed $111,000. However, if you correct the issue within 30 days, the per form penalty is reduced from $270 to $50. Where your Form 8300 reporting failures are found to be willful or intentional, you could also face criminal prosecution. Call 800-681-1295 to schedule a reduced rate initial consultation or book ONLINE today. Public Contact: Dave Klasing Esq. M.S.-Tax CPA, [email protected] SOURCE Tax Law Offices of David W.
